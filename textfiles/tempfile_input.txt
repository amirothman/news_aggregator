Andrea Leadsom, the Conservative leadership candidate who dramatically pulled out of the race, is the new Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary.The prominent Brexit backer is promoted from energy minister to a cabinet role which will see her take responsibility for a farming industry as it faces the end of European Union subsidies. She will also have to fashion a post-Brexit fisheries policy. Green campaigners will be watching carefully to see what happens to environment regulations in areas including wildlife habitats, air pollution and water quality, currently governed by rules from Europe. Mrs Leadsom's public reason for withdrawing from the leadership race was to allow a rapid transition at the top, and give the economy certainty in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.

 A string of members of Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet have quit and Hilary Benn has been sacked. Here's a quick guide to who's going and who remains in Labour's top team.



MPs who have left shadow cabinet:Shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn (sacked)



Media captionHilary Benn tells the BBC's Andrew Marr: Jeremy Corbyn "not a leader"
Hilary Benn was sacked as shadow foreign secretary after he phoned Jeremy Corbyn and told him he had lost confidence in his ability to lead the party. He told the BBC it had been a "very difficult decision" to tell Mr Corbyn he no longer had confidence in him. But he added that Labour needed "strong and effective leadership". "We don't currently have that and there is also no confidence that we will be able to win a general election as long as Jeremy remains leader." Mr Benn, the MP for Leeds Central, had disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn in September over air strikes on Syria. He served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments and was in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. Shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander (resigned)



A former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East has a lower profile than Mr Benn outside Westminster. Made shadow health secretary in Jeremy Corbyn's first shadow cabinet, she was categorised as "neutral but not hostile" to Mr Corbyn in a list of Labour MPs leaked to The Times in March.  But in a letter on Sunday, she said she was resigning with a "heavy heart" from the shadow cabinet following the referendum result:  "As much as I respect you as a man of principle, I do not believe you have the capacity to shape the answers our country is demanding and I believe that if we are to form the next government, a change of leadership is essential."Shadow minister for young people and voter registration Gloria De Piero (resigned)



The former GMTV reporter has resigned. According to the Guardian, in her letter to Mr Corbyn she told him: "I do not believe you can deliver... victory at a general election, which may take place in a matter of months. "I have been contacted by many of my members this weekend and it is clear that a good number of them share that view and have lost faith in your leadership." She has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election and held various shadow ministerial roles under Ed Miliband.Shadow secretary of state for Scotland Ian Murray (resigned)

Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray, the only current Labour MP in Scotland, has resigned as shadow Scotland secretary. Mr Murray told the BBC it had been an "incredibly difficult decision" but the sacking of Hilary Benn had been "the final straw for me". He said Mr Corbyn was a "decent human being" and was "principled" but said ultimately: "He can't lead the Labour Party in a general election because he's not likely to win." He said the party must widen its appeal outside its "comfort zone". He had continued as shadow Scottish secretary under Mr Corbyn, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May 2015.Shadow education secretary Lucy Powell (resigned)

The Manchester Central MP has confirmed that she has resigned "with regret" from the shadow cabinet. In a letter to Mr Corbyn, she said: "It is increasingly clear that your position is untenable and that you are unable to command the support of the shadow cabinet, the Parliamentary Labour Party and, most importantly, the country... I do not have the confidence that you can bring the party together, lead us to a general election and be an effective opposition." Elected in 2012, Ms Powell was a close ally of Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the 2015 Labour leadership campaign she said she had "never, ever met or spoken to" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. Shadow environment secretary Kerry McCarthy (resigned)

The Bristol East MP said in her resignation letter that a new leader was needed "to take on the challenges ahead, steering our way through the very difficult period facing this country". First elected in 2005, she had previously shadowed positions in the Foreign Office, Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions.  She is also a vegan and campaigns on food issues.Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Seema Malhotra (resigned)

Seema Malhotra, John McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team, wrote to Mr Corbyn that she was proud to have served in his top team but said the Labour Party was now "hugely divided" and those divisions were growing."I have come to the view that under your leadership we will not be able to build bridges across the party." MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston since a 2011 by-election, she was made shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. Shadow transport secretary Lilian Greenwood (resigned)



The Nottingham South MP told the BBC she had had "concerns and doubts" about Mr Corbyn's leadership for a while but the prospect of a snap general election had made her think about whether she could ask voters to back him for prime minister. "Sadly I don't think Jeremy is in a position to provide the leadership that we need to be able to offer the voters and the country." She has represented her constituency since 2010 and was promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership. Shadow Northern Ireland secretary Vernon Coaker (resigned)



The MP for Gedling told the BBC's Sunday Politics East Midlands: "All of us have to consider the positions we hold, to find the best way forward for our party... People are going to have to make quick decisions." He was shadow Northern Ireland secretary and shadow defence secretary under Ed Miliband and minister for schools under Gordon Brown. He chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign in the 2015 contest won by Mr Corbyn.Shadow justice secretary Lord Falconer (resigned)



Lord Falconer was shadow justice secretary - a role to which he had been appointed before Mr Corbyn's election as leader, by acting leader Harriet Harman.

Karl Turner, who attended shadow cabinet meetings, has resigned as shadow attorney general "with a very heavy heart".The MP for Kingston Upon Hull East, a former shadow solicitor general, had replaced Catherine McKinnell who resigned in January, also citing concerns about Labour's direction under Mr Corbyn. Mr Turner wrote to Mr Corbyn: "It has become increasingly clear that you do not hold the support of the shadow cabinet and the wider Parliamentary Labour Party. "After the result of the referendum, the country is calling out for strong leadership and opposition to this vicious Tory government."At this moment in time I feel like the people of East Hull would be best served if I was to put all of my effort into my constituency work, fighting to make sure that we keep an MP who will stand up for workers' rights as well as the poorest and most vulnerable."Shadow Commons leader Chris Bryant (resigned)


Image copyright

The MP for Rhondda moved to the shadow Commons role from the job of shadow culture secretary. He told the BBC Mr Corbyn's management of the referendum campaign "left many voters on polling day not even knowing which way Jeremy himself was going to vote" and that he suspected the Labour leader may have voted to Leave. Mr Bryant added: "Not only is that a betrayal of Labour's historic position on the European Union - a fundamental economic and foreign policy objective of ours - but also it means that if he were to lead us into a general election, the latest poll shows we would lose 150 seats - we would be a rump of 75 members of Parliament."Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down because of disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.Shadow work and pensions secretary Owen Smith (resigned)

In his resignation letter Mr Smith, the MP for Pontypridd, said: "The communities we seek to represent need a Labour Party that is able to articulate their concerns and most importantly win power to deliver for them".He also said Jeremy Corbyn could be leading the party towards a formal split - and possibly the emergence of a new party - which Mr Smith said he wanted to avoid.Mr Smith said he wanted to have a leader who could unite the party. The former shadow Welsh secretary previously said it was a "great honour" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, Mr Smith spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist. Shadow energy secretary Lisa Nandy (resigned)



The Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has resigned from the shadow cabinet. Before being made shadow energy secretary she had been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left-wing journalist Owen Jones has previously said he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.Ms Nandy said: "The lack of confidence in the leadership goes beyond the small group of MPs who have consistently opposed Jeremy since his election."It has become clear that he is unable to form a broad, inclusive shadow cabinet that draws on the best of our movement's left and right traditions."She said a leadership contest was inevitable and that Tom Watson ought to take over as a caretaker leader.Shadow secretary of state for Wales Nia Griffith (resigned)



The MP for Llanelli since 2005, Ms Griffith said she had met Mr Corbyn to discuss the leadership of the party but felt the discussions had not given her confidence unity could be achieved in the party. She said: "I made clear to Jeremy that I have always admired his commitment to the causes that matter to him, but last week's referendum result and the likelihood of an early general election mean that the party now requires new leadership. "Jeremy has lost the confidence of the party, including many members who initially supported him, and he should now do the honourable thing and resign." She had also been the shadow minister for Wales under the last leadership and earlier served as a shadow business minister. Shadow minister for housing and planning John Healey (resigned)



Mr Healey had been shadowing a portfolio he held under Gordon Brown. The Wentworth and Dearne MP held a range of posts during the Labour government, including financial secretary to the Treasury and local government minister. In his resignation letter he said he had met with Mr Corbyn but was "deeply disappointed with the discussion". He added that Mr Corbyn was "clearly not prepared to accept the special responsibility you have" in meeting the challenges caused by "unprecedented national uncertainty and lack of government leadership post-Brexit".Shadow women and equalities minister Kate Green (resigned)



Kate Green said she recognised the mandate Mr Corbyn had from party members, and that he had "energised our politics" since becoming leader. But she said "the most important task we face today as a party is to show the leadership that our country needs".The former head of the National Council for One Parent Families and the Child Poverty Action group was made a shadow minister by Ed Miliband after entering Parliament in 2010. The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Mr Corbyn.Shadow business secretary Angela Eagle (resigned)

Angela Eagle, who represented the Remain side in some of the EU TV debates, had also been shadow first secretary of state and had deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions. She said the decision to quit had been "agonising", adding: "I have examined my conscience and I have made this personal decision."I think it is in the best interests of the Labour Party that Jeremy now examines his conscience and makes a decision to leave with dignity." The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. She had previously been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but was given the business brief instead.Shadow culture secretary Maria Eagle (resigned)

Maria Eagle is the identical twin sister of the party's now former business spokeswoman, Angela, and has also resigned from her position as shadow culture secretary.

Amid reports of further expected shadow cabinet resignations, he told the BBC rebels should "calm down, listen to their members" and remember a basic principle of the Labour Party, "solidarity". He said Mr Corbyn had done well in electoral tests so far - by-elections and the local and mayoral elections. "He's not going anywhere... the support out there is enormous," he said. He said Mr Corbyn was "not going" as leader and, whatever happened: "I will never stand for leadership of the Labour Party". He said he and Mr Corbyn had been friends for decades adding: "I will always have his back."   The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010. A prominent rebel under previous Labour leaders, he sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be "honoured" for taking part in their "armed struggle", while attending a gathering  to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands.

Mr Watson was at the Glastonbury festival when Mr Benn was sacked and has headed back to London. Returning to London, he said he was "deeply disappointed" that Hilary Benn had been sacked and "equally saddened" by the shadow cabinet resignations. He said his focus was on party unity and he would be meeting Mr Corbyn for talks "to discuss the way forward".  The former trade union official entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit. He was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under Gordon Brown. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry

The former shadow defence secretary will replace Hilary Benn as shadow foreign secretary in Mr Corbyn's new cabinet.Ms Thornberry, who is MP for Islington South, told the BBC it was "extraordinary" that some of her colleagues thought it was the right time for a leadership challenge. "I'm not going to resign," she said. She said at "a time like this when the Tory party are pulling themselves apart, when nobody has any idea where the country is going," the Labour Party should "remain unified as a party". Ms Thornberry was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2015 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. She was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She nominated Mr Corbyn in the leadership election. Shadow health secretary Diane Abbott

Another veteran left-winger, Diane Abbott will replace Heidi Alexander, who quit as shadow health secretary. The former shadow international development secretary is seen as being close to Mr Corbyn and described the resignations as a "kind of Westminster bubble coup" and said they were "not what the party wants".  She said the "coup attempt" was "long-planned" by those opposed to Mr Corbyn's leadership and said it was "disingenuous" to say things had changed because of the EU referendum result. "Ordinary party members will not understand why Labour MPs want to set themselves at odds with the membership," she said. Ms Abbott stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.Shadow lord president of the council and Labour's campaigns and elections director Jon Trickett

Mr Trickett had been shadow communities secretary but was appointed shadow lord president of the council and Labour's campaigns and elections director following resignations from the shadow cabinet. As news of shadow cabinet resignations came in, Mr Trickett, one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party, told the BBC News Channel: "If they want to have a contest, let them say who their candidate is, let them say what their programme for Britain is and let's have a leadership contest and let's test the argument." The MP for Hemsworth said Mr Corbyn "will be on the ballot paper" in any leadership contest.  "There are now hundreds of thousands of party members and I think... let's see what they think about the future."Mr Trickett is replaced as shadow communities secretary by Grahame Morris, who moved from the whips' office.

Defeated leadership contender Andy Burnham has tweeted that he will not be resigning, saying he respected the mandate given to Mr Corbyn by party members and adding: "I have never taken part in a coup against any leader of the Labour Party and I am not going to start now." Mr Burnham, who has announced he will run for mayor of Greater Manchester in 2017, served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 leadership contest and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary.

This article is designed to be an easy-to-understand guide on what happens now that the UK has voted to leave the European Union. What does Brexit mean?It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.Why is Britain leaving the European Union?A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Find the result in your area
What was the breakdown across the UK?England voted strongly for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.What is the European Union?The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a "single market" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.



Media captionHow does the European Union work?
What happens now?Theresa May supported the campaign for Britain to stay in the EU but since becoming prime minister - after her fellow Remain campaigner David Cameron stepped down - she has said she will respect the will of the people and said: "Brexit means Brexit and we're going to make a success of it." For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Mrs May has said she will not kick off this process before the end of 2016. This means that we will not begin to get a clear idea of what kind of deal the UK will seek from the EU, on trade and immigration, until next year.Who is going to negotiate Britain's exit from the EU?

Image caption

                    David Davis has been appointed Secretary of State for Brexit
                

Theresa May has set up a new government department, to be headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, has been given the job of international trade minister and Boris Johnson, who led the Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum - and it is now rushing to hire a team of skilled negotiators to manage the complex business of negotiating withdrawal and ensuring Britain gets the best possible deal.How long will it take for Britain to leave the EU?Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested the country could formally sever its relationship with the EU by December 2018. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.




Image caption

                    The process to take the UK out of the European Union starts with invoking Article 50 and will take at least two years from that point
                

Why will Brexit take so long?Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. Will the process of disentangling British laws from EU ones happen at the same time as negotiations to set up a new deal governing the terms of trade between the EU and the UK? No one really knows yet. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.What happens to EU citizens living in the UK?The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent.EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the "will of Parliament," he added.What happens to UK citizens working in the EU?A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.What about EU nationals who want to work in the UK?Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages.Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a "surge" in new arrivals.What about all the economic warnings about Brexit? Were they wrong?There was a dramatic fall in the value of the pound against the dollar and in share prices in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher.But a month after the vote share prices in the UK had recovered, with the FTSE 100 trading higher than before the referendum. The broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, remains about 1.5% lower than before the Brexit vote.Retail sales figures for July were up on the same period last year, defying predictions of a post-Brexit slump. And UK industrial output grew at the fastest rate for 17 years in the April-to-June quarter, up 2.1% compared with the first quarter of the year. The Office for National Statistics said "very few" respondents had been affected by the uncertainty from the referendum vote.However, the Bank of England has announced additional measures to stimulate the UK economy amid uncertainty over Brexit and worries about productivity and economic growth, cutting interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009. Another key plank of its stimulus policy - buying up UK government bonds - has run into trouble after the Bank failed to find enough sellers of long-dated government debt.The rate cut followed figures showing the UK economy contracting at its fastest rate since the financial crisis. The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index - a closely-watched economic barometer - showed activity in the UK's dominant services sector saw its sharpest fall in seven years, from 52.3 in June to 47.4 in July, suggesting a downturn is on its way.What has been the effect on the value of the pound?Sterling has lost more than 10% of its value against the dollar since Brexit. With the pound worth about $1.30, this is down to the lowest levels since 1985.It has also fallen in value against the euro. For much of 2015 the pound would buy you between €1.35-1.45. This year sterling has weakened against the euro, and has dropped following the Brexit vote to about €1.16.Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs.What does that mean for prices in the shops?



Media captionShoppers will need to keep a close eye on how much they are spending
Summer holidaymakers travelling overseas from the UK are finding that their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term. If they are correct, imported goods will consequently get more expensive - that means food, clothing and homeware are all likely to get pricier.These price rises might not kick in immediately. For example, all the big retailers would have factored in the currency risk when organising their finances. In effect they have insured themselves against a fall in the pound, but this will start to unwind next year leading to price increases in the shops.Sellers of luxury items, such as high-end cars, have much bigger profit margins, so may be able to absorb the extra costs without passing these on to customers.   Will immigration be cut?

Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. The key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a "sustainable" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.Could there be a second referendum? 



It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they win the next general election.Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option. Will I need a visa to travel to the EU? While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.

Will I still be able to use my passport?Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.Some say we could still remain in the single market - but what is a single market? The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a "level playing field". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.

But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.

                    Nicola Sturgeon says a new independence referendum in Scotland is likely
                

What does this mean for Scotland?Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is "democratically unacceptable" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now "highly likely", she has said.What does it mean for Northern Ireland?Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be "very profound" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. How will pensions, savings, investments and mortgages be affected?During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called "triple lock" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest.If economic performance deteriorates, the Bank of England could decide on a further programme of quantitative easing, as an alternative to cutting interest rates, which would lower bond yields and with them annuity rates. So anyone taking out a pension annuity could get less income for their money. Though it's worth pointing out that annuity rates have been falling since before the vote anyway.The Bank of England may consider raising interest rates to combat extra pressure on inflation. That would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay but would be good news for savers. However it is still too soon to say whether or not these warnings will prove accurate.Will duty-free sales on Europe journeys return?

Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an "upside" or "silver lining" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the "customs union" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be "an incredible boost for my business" but he later said  that remark had been "light-hearted". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote "it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be."  Will EHIC cards still be valid?They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.Will cars need new number plates?Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could MPs block an EU exit?Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020. Will leaving the EU mean we don't have to abide by the European Court of Human Rights?The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights. As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR. However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers. Will the UK be able to rejoin the EU in the future?BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.Who wanted the UK to leave the EU?The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. What were their reasons for wanting the UK to leave?They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is "free movement", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of "ever closer union" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a "United States of Europe". Who wanted the UK to stay in the EU?Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain "special" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.  What were their reasons for wanting the UK to stay?Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.What about businesses?Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was "terrified" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.

                    Boris Johnson was one of the most prominent Leave campaigners
                

Who led the rival sides in the campaign? 

Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU was headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose. It was backed by key figures from the Conservative Party, including Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne, most Labour MPs, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Alan Johnson, who ran the Labour In for Britain campaign, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance party and the SDLP in Northern Ireland, and the Green Party. Who funded the campaign: Britain Stronger in Europe raised £6.88m, boosted by two donations totalling £2.3m from the supermarket magnate and Labour peer Lord Sainsbury. Other prominent Remain donors included hedge fund manager David Harding (£750,000), businessman and Travelex founder Lloyd Dorfman (£500,000) and the Tower Limited Partnership (£500,000).  Read a Who's Who guide. Who else campaigned to remain: The SNP ran its own remain campaign in Scotland as it did not want to share a platform with the Conservatives. Several smaller groups also registered to campaign.

Vote Leave - A cross-party campaign that has the backing of senior Conservatives such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson plus a handful of Labour MPs, including Gisela Stuart and Graham Stringer, and UKIP's Douglas Carswell and Suzanne Evans, and the DUP in Northern Ireland. Former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson and SDP founder Lord Owen were also involved. It had a string of affiliated groups such as Farmers for Britain, Muslims for Britain and Out and Proud, a gay anti-EU group, aimed at building support in different communities. Who funded the campaign: Vote Leave raised £2.78m. Its largest supporter was businessman Patrick Barbour, who gave £500,000. Former Conservative Party treasurer Peter Cruddas gave a £350,000 donation and construction mogul Terence Adams handed over £300,000. Read a Who's Who guide. Who else campaigned to leave: UKIP leader Nigel Farage is not part of Vote Leave. His party ran its own campaign. The Trade Union and Socialist Coalition is also running its own out campaign. Several smaller groups also registered to campaign.
Will the EU still use English?Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - "much to France's chagrin", she says.Will a Brexit harm product safety?Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:Which MPs were for staying and which for leaving? The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.How much does the UK contribute to the EU and how much do we get in return?In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.

The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.If I retire to Spain or another EU country will my healthcare costs still be covered? David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.What will happen to protected species?Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.How much money will the UK save through changes to migrant child benefits and welfare payments? Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his "emergency brake" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Will we be barred from the Eurovision Song Contest?

                    To participate in the Eurovision Song Contest countries need to be a member of the European Broadcasting Union, which is independent of the EU
                

Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: "All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC."Has Brexit made house prices fall?

PA

As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to "uncertainty" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.  What is the 'red tape' that opponents of the EU complain about?Ged, from Liverpool, suspects "red tape" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called "red tape" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the "Norway model" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.Will Britain be party to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership? Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.What impact will leaving the EU have on the NHS?Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as "scaremongering" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Former Labour health secretary Lord Owen has said that because of TTIP (see answer above) the only way to protect the NHS from further privatisation was to get out of the EU.



The power goes out in the capital city for as long as 10 hours a day, there is little cash available at the banks, food prices have skyrocketed and every second hospital is closed due to a lack of medication or staff. There's trash everywhere -- on every street and every corner. People crouch as they walk. Shots can be heard -- isolated ones -- in what has become everyday life in Tripoli, Libya.


"We will burn the ground beneath their feet," Moammar Gadhafi said, threatening his opponents as his time as the country's dictator drew to a close. Gadhafi was shot and killed in 2011, but his threat came true. The massive desert country, with only 6.4 million inhabitants, already had plenty of weapons and ammunition depots even back them. Gadhafi had opened the depots for his supporters and allowed weapons to be sold in the major cities. That same weapons arsenal is Gadhafi's legacy and the basis of today's civil war. 
Libya, of course, also had its zero hour -- a time when things could have gone very differently if the United States, Russia, Europe and, naturally, the people of Libya themselves had made a more serious effort. But the opportunity was lost and the old authorities merely got replaced by the anarchy of the militias -- young men, often still children, who control the streets with one gun on their waistband and the other in their hand. 

A Dark World

In Tripoli's Qerqarish district, just behind a shopping street where vendors selling brands like Mango and Benetton wait for customers, a dark world begins. With few jobs, little industry and no growth, many here are involved in the smuggling business. They trade in cigarettes and drugs, but mostly in people. Entire parts of the city are sinking into poverty and transforming into a criminal jungle.
Few countries are more important to Germany than Libya right now. Thousands of refugees depart from the country each day as they make their way to Europe, and tens of thousands more are waiting to set sail. Meanwhile, Islamic State has also found a home in this burning country. That makes Libya a center of two of the major issues currently occupying Germany and Europe.
What went wrong? In 2011, there had been a united and victorious battle against Gadhafi's troops. That was Libya's zero hour. But then the rebels split into different camps -- Islamists and non-Islamists -- reigniting old tribal feuds. Only this time everyone had plenty of weapons. Gadhafi's former fighters joined the non-Islamists, as did the army of Khalifa Haftar, the powerful general in the east of the country. Islamic State joined the side of the Islamists. Regional conflicts had already existed even before and today the country is divided between east and west and countless militias, with some disappearing and new ones emerging each week.
Other countries are also, unhelpfully, influencing events in the country. The United Arab Emirates, which did not want the Arab Spring to succeed, sent weapons to the conflict zone. Russia provides General Haftar with weapons. Qatar sends money. Jordan is intervening all over the place on a small scale, as are the United States and France.
The devastated country lacks not only order, but leadership, structure and the sense of common identity that might keep people united in these uncertain times. Instead, each person is out for him or herself, trying to save whatever they can -- their money in the bank, for example. Over 40 billion dinar have been withdrawn from the banks and the central bank -- which has now also been divided, with one in the east and one in the west -- had to print money abroad, one in Britain and the other in Russia. The exchange rate on the black market turned the militia leaders into millionaires. Human-traffickers and drug and weapons smugglers are also buying off politicians, which has contributed to the implosion of the political process that was commenced in 2011 and which is constantly getting set back to zero.

The Main Staging Ground on Path To Europe

As the government structures fall apart, Libya has become the main staging ground on the journey to Europe, a hub for traffickers and refugees alike. No one does anything to help the migrants who have been captured by the Libyan coast guard. They can be found sitting in camps like the one in Abu Salim, where 150 men share around 50 mattresses in one muggy room and 60 women can be found on 60 mattresses in another. They whisper that they are being mistreated and that they are never allowed to get fresh air. They were captured on a beach, shortly before they were to depart for Europe, and now they are waiting to be taken to the desert in the country's south.
Even Fayez Sarraj's new government is unable to offer its people much by way of protection. The government had been brokered by the United Nations. The West considers Sarraj to be a man who could unite Libya, a country in which there are still two governments -- one in Tripoli and another in Bayda in the east. Sarraj's unity government still hasn't been officially recognized by the political forces in the east. Martin Kobler, the German special representative for the UN for Libya, has compared the government to an ambulance that transports the seriously injured to the hospital without a license plate -- meaning it lacks legitimacy, but will at least hopefully keep the country from falling apart completely.







DER SPIEGEL
Map: A country divided


It is hot and sticky in Tripoli. During the day, the streets are packed and bustling, with few people working. Everyone here says they fear attacks and shootings. Despite this, there are still people here who could leave Libya, but choose to stay because they are determined to save their country. People like the student leader who organizes an international book swap each year. Or the human rights expert who dispatches stoic reports about abuse of migrants and private torture chambers to Human Rights Watch and journalists. 
Fifty-six-year-old Prime Minister Sarraj, an architect, is one of these people. His father had been a minister during the times of the monarchy, before Gadhafi came to power in 1969. Sarraj himself had been a member of parliament in Tobruk. The UN and Libya's international partners appointed him as prime minister specifically because he isn't closely aligned with any group, he has no criminal background and because he appears to be entirely free of corruption. All these factors are simultaneously strengths and weaknesses, because Sarraj appears to be independent, but also lacks a strong connection to the people he is supposed to be governing. Nor has he been elected in any election or vote by parliament. 
Sarraj receives two editors from SPIEGEL to conduct an interview at a navy base. Pictures of sea battles are hanging all over the place, images of things that are burning or exploding. 
What will happen to Libya? Will the country disintegrate into two or more parts that will be forever at war with each other because they all want power over Libya's oil? Will it become a second Somalia controlled by pirates, thieves and jihadists? Or will Prime Minister Sarraj succeed in establishing a conciliatory dialogue that can result in rebuilding Libya into a normal country? 


SPIEGEL: Mr. Prime Minister, are you really the right man to lead Libya?

Sarraj: It would be better if you posed this question to the people of Libya -- they are qualified to answer it. The situation here is complicated, and when I was appointed chairman of the Libyan presidency council, I was in any case ready to accept the assignment. We are hoping for support, both locally and internationally.

SPIEGEL: It is said that you are a good listener, that you're well educated, that you're not corrupt and, if we may say so, that you're a pleasant man. Will you be taken seriously in a country as armed and brutal as Libya?

Sarraj: The Libyans have experienced a great deal of unrest and difficulties during the past five years, as well as a delicate security situation. They need a bit of peace and reflection.

SPIEGEL: You don't have any apparatus of power -- you don't even have the power base to govern in Tripoli, not to mention the east. We're sitting here at a naval base at the port, and you are relying on a militia to provide you with protection. Do you have any connection to your people whatsoever?

Sarraj: This here was our first stop when we arrived in Tripoli in the spring. The new seat of government for the prime minister is now located in the original government building. We work there often. But now and then we get a longing for the naval base.

SPIEGEL: It offers a great view of the sea.

Sarraj: (Laughs.) The sea air! And seriously: I meet with the people often.

SPIEGEL: Do you feel safe?

Sarraj: Most of the time.

SPIEGEL: There haven't been any attempted attacks yet?

Sarraj: No, as we Arabs say: Whether you live or die lies in the hands of God. One should not have too much fear.

SPIEGEL: So you still consider the probability of terrorist attacks to be very likely?

Sarraj: The threats will increase as a result of our fight against terrorism, but we have to play our role and take responsibility in this battle. That is our fate.

SPIEGEL: When you traveled in a ship from Tunis to Tripoli in March, to get started with the business of governing, you had the support of the people. Unfortunately, that backing is now dwindling because the situation is so difficult and unstable. Why can't you offer your people more?

Sarraj: I didn't take office until March 30, 2016. We were immediately confronted with numerous problems that were produced by former governments and the old regime, not by us. We have a difficult environment here and no financial resources. Oil exports have stopped. The government has no revenues.

SPIEGEL: No taxes, nothing?

Sarraj: No. We have been working here for months without a budget. We first got access to a small amount of resources two weeks ago that we have been able to pass along to the ministries, making a few things easier.

SPIEGEL: How much money?

Sarraj: 1.5 billion Libyan dinar.

SPIEGEL: That would have been worth just under a billion euros in 2009, but the value of the dinar is falling.

Sarraj: Anyone who is familiar with economics knows that this is not enough to enable a country to function -- particularly in a postwar situation in which there is so much damage all across the country.

SPIEGEL: Where will you start with rebuilding?

Sarraj: Everywhere at once, but of course it won't happen quickly enough for the people anywhere. Sometimes we are only able to mitigate the impact of the problems, not solve them.

SPIEGEL: No, the problems actually seem to be getting bigger right now.

Sarraj: Let's take electricity as an example. The war and the lack of maintenance and repairs have triggered a mechanical crisis that has in turn resulted in many power plant outages. Foreign firms had to leave the country because of the security situation. There were no replacement parts. And the demand increased.

SPIEGEL: Through flight and migration?

Sarraj: That too. But also because of the summer heat. In any case, we contacted numerous companies, including Siemens, in order to get the plants working again.

SPIEGEL: Was it successful?

Sarraj: Yes, an improvement will soon be felt by the people. Or look at the liquidity crisis: It was created because oil exports, already hit by falling prices, fell to a minimal level and because citizens and businesspeople pulled close to 24 billion dinar out of the banks. The banks almost collapsed.

SPIEGEL: What are you doing to counteract this?

Sarraj: We have contacted the two central banks in order to solve the problem. During Ramadan, we supported businesspeople both financially and in terms of easing imports so that prices wouldn't continue to climb. We also printed dinar abroad.

SPIEGEL: Young men continue to join the militias. Schools and universities are open, but there is no work.

Sarraj: We only have a limited number of jobs that can be offered in the public sector. In order to create jobs, we need an economic upswing, and for that to happen, we need to recommence our oil exports. They are the decisive motor for our economy.

SPIEGEL: Do you have a plan for the rebuilding the economy?

Sarraj: The presidency council and I have ordered the resumption of oil exports and the repair of the important ports. Once the country has revenue streams again, we will carry out infrastructure projects, build the factories and revive trade.

SPIEGEL: You have little support and likely little time. Why aren't you acting more assertively? Why don't you leave it to the two central bank chiefs in the east and west to solve the money problem together? Why aren't you initiating a national dialogue under your auspices with the true ruling powers -- the men with the weapons?

Sarraj: Don't underestimate us -- we have done a lot. There have been meetings with the two central bank heads in Bayda in the east and here in Tripoli and even in Tunis, because we want to unite the central banks. These efforts are ongoing. Unfortunately, the political tensions between east and west are casting a shadow over these talks.

SPIEGEL: How was Islamic State able to become so strong in Libya?

Sarraj: The reason is that there was a security vacuum in Libya after 2011.

SPIEGEL: You mean the lack of police, military and a functioning civil society after Gadhafi's toppling?

Sarraj: Yes. We often pointed this out to the world, but nobody listened. No one gave us support. Today our youth are fighting bravely against Islamic State, but IS remains an international problem.

SPIEGEL: Is the West listening to you now?

Sarraj: We are exchanging views. We have received support from the United States, which helped a lot. We still need logistical support. We need the lifting of sanctions against our armed forces that are fighting against IS. And it is enormously important that the West take in our injured. We have no medicines and our hospitals aren't in working order. We all have a shared responsibility for these young men who are fighting for our cause.

SPIEGEL: Many countries have so far pursued their own interests in Libya.

Sarraj: I cannot speak to the past, but since we have been in office, the United States has been helping to overcome the crisis and in the fight against terrorism. The Americans are supporting our military in the battle against Islamic State in Sirte with airstrikes. There is also contact with Saudi Arabia -- I was there and they pledged to promote the process of national reconciliation.

SPIEGEL: Your government has not yet been officially recognized by the eastern part of the country, and many consider you to be a puppet of the West. How is that supposed to work?

Sarraj: By changing it. There is no problem between us and the parliament in the east -- the problems exist within the parliament in Tobruk. So far, the confidence vote to legitimize the government has been obstructed there. We have done everything conceivable: When our first government was criticized for being too large, we offered to create a significantly smaller one. To date, the parliament in Tobruk has neither rejected that nor agreed to it. Supporters of the government were driven to keep silent with threats. Can I use this interview to make an appeal?

SPIEGEL: We're listening.

Sarraj: The parliament in Tobruk needs to finally allow the decisive session to take place, so that members of parliament can exercise their democratic right and express their view of the government. Libya needs progress, not a blockade.

SPIEGEL: Who do you blame for the blockade?

Sarraj: The problem is the continual obstruction of this session and parliament's disappearance from the political stage. We were forced, here in Tripoli, to ask our ministers to start their work without official recognition from parliament.

SPIEGEL: You are avoiding mentioning the name of Khalifa Hafter, the east's military leader and a man who would like to have your position. General Hafter is the one preventing any kind of unity.

Sarraj: Now we've arrived at a minefield. I've visited Mr. Hafter in his office, and we had a discussion. We told him that he should recognize the presidency council and that the military leadership must be subordinate to the political leadership.

SPIEGEL: How do you intend to prevail?

Sarraj: The insistence of the military leadership under General Hafter that it is not subordinate is a serious problem. The parliament in Tobruk has rejected this subordination, even though they had agreed to it in the Skhirat accord in Morocco. Now, unfortunately, we are back at the beginning of the dialogue.

SPIEGEL: What does Hafter require in exchange for him becoming cooperative? Would half the country be enough?

Sarraj: We cannot live in a country in which the military and political leaderships are working separately and against each other. Mr. Hafter and Mr. Agila Saleh Essa, the head of the parliament, need to allow the decisive session of parliament to take place.

SPIEGEL: Doesn't Libya need to be split anyways because of the endless conflicts? An arrangement of three states -- Misrata, Benghazi and the south -- under a central political government, would also be conceivable.

Sarraj: That is all unrealistic. The future of Libya lies in the hands of the people, not in those of the politicians or the military. And the Libyans believe that Libya is a single entity -- and the political elites should realize that they must forge ahead with the Libyan Unity project. Today's government exists for everybody -- in the east, the west and the south.

SPIEGEL: What will you do if Islamic State is defeated in Sirte, the Misratis want to keep the city -- and then General Hafter rejects this? The next civil war could unfold there.

Sarraj: I want to take this opportunity to congratulate our heroes. I value their willingness to sacrifice themselves in order to free our country from terrorism. I plea to God that he take mercy on our martyrs.

SPIEGEL: Will you answer our question?

Sarraj: My answer: We are all Libyans. We do not accept that parallel illegitimate institutions act outside of our agreement. We will not stop calling for them to overcome this country's division. If Libyans are not united, we will not be able to achieve the goals of our people. And I'm not worried about Sirte: The inhabitants of Sirte, who were forced to flee, will return and rebuild the city. The city has a tradition, and Sirte is no vacuum -- one cannot wrest it from the citizens.

SPIEGEL: Libya is a rich country. What went so fundamentally wrong after Gadhafi's fall?

Sarraj: Many decisions would have been easy to implement right after the revolution, easier than today. Back then the weapons of the youths and all of the other fighters could have been collected. If there had been explanations, goals and opportunities, it would have worked. But nobody did it. Militias were founded, there were many militias and that led to today's situation.

SPIEGEL: What mistakes did the West make?

Sarraj: Shortly after the revolution, the West abandoned Libya. The country stood alone with its economic, societal and political problems.

SPIEGEL: You mean that Libya could have used nation-building, or reconstruction aid or at the very least attention?

Sarraj: Yes, after decades of dictatorship and a violent revolution, that's only natural.

SPIEGEL: Now Europe is struggling with the refugee crisis. Do you sense this has made the West more understanding?

Sarraj: It has gotten better lately. The West is trying to understand and help Libya. Illegal migration creates problems for Libya as it does for the West. But above all else it's a humanitarian catastrophe for all of those who are fleeing and for their families. The crisis has three dimensions: a humanitarian one, a financial one and a criminal one. Libya is a bridge to the West for migrants and smugglers. Unfortunately, our southern area, the desert, is open, and the borders there are open.

SPIEGEL: Is Libya doing everything it possibly can in this crisis?

Sarraj: We have built up good relations with our neighboring countries, and we are working on borders with joint controls. Our view is that people who are caught should be sent back to their countries of origin. We cannot be their home, because of our unstable situation we cannot take them in.

SPIEGEL: The man who is possibly the biggest human trafficker in Libya lives in Sabratha. It is believed that he smuggles at least one-third of all migrants coming to Europe, or around 50,000 per year.

Sarraj: These kinds of networks are bigger than individuals -- they exist in Libya but also in neighboring countries and in Europe. We are talking with Germany, Italy, the EU. We will lead the fight together in order to save the refugees and beat the smugglers.

SPIEGEL: Do you also expect more engagement on this issue from Europe?

Sarraj: Yes, there are two levels of cooperation. One is that the Europeans should apply pressure on the surrounding countries in the south. On Chad, Niger, Mali. So that the border controls work and are taken seriously. The border soldiers on both sides require training. And as for Operation Sophia in the Mediterranean: We hope that the Europeans will modernize and support our navy, so that it can play its role. It is very weak.

SPIEGEL: Why does an architect become a prime minister?

Sarraj: That's difficult to answer. I was asked. It's an experience, that I can tell you.

SPIEGEL: You couldn't have said "no"?

Sarraj: I couldn't. It's a national duty. By the way, I have endurance, and the architect's way of thinking can be useful when it comes to finding political solutions.

SPIEGEL: How so?

Sarraj: Purposeful planning. Exactitude.

SPIEGEL: Will you wage a look into the future: Is Libya more likely to develop in the direction of Somalia or in the direction of, let's say, Italy.

Sarraj: We will not become like Somalia.



SPIEGEL: What kind of Libya would you like to leave behind for your successor?

Sarraj: A secure and stable one, a prosperous one in which the people smile once again; our people have suffered very much and have a right to prosperity and security. One with better relationships to its neighbors, one in which the state functions and has the sole right to the use of force. One that is free of the Islamic State and one that has a self-evident place in the international community.

SPIEGEL: Mr. Prime Minister, we thank you for this interview.

André Taubert used to feel pretty forsaken when he drove his old Mercedes through northern Germany every day.


He and one other colleague were the only ones dealing with Islamists in four German states: Bremen, Hamburg, Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein. They were constantly getting phone calls from worried mothers, women whose sons or daughter were in the process of discovering jihadism. The women were desperate and concerned that they were losing touch with their own children, who suddenly seemed like strangers.
From 2012 to 2015, Taubert's schedule often meant visiting as many as three different cities in a single day: Kiel in the morning, for example, Göttingen in the afternoon and Bremen in the evening. "We had to set priorities, make lists and think about where we could still have an impact," he says. "They were kamikaze missions."
Prevention was not an important topic at the time, at least not for lawmakers. There was only one counselling center for the family members of Islamists in all of northern Germany -- with only one position paid for with public funds, which Taubert and his co-worker shared. 
The working conditions have improved since then. In July 2015, 39-year-old Taubert became the head of Hamburg-based Legato, an "office for religiously motivated radicalization." A team of nine employees now operates in Hamburg alone, where they have already handled 130 cases in only one year. None of these young people has traveled to Syria yet, says Taubert, and he is not aware of any of them having become terrorism suspects.
"I'm annoyed by statements that we can't do anything about terrorist attacks, just because the security authorities don't recognize everything. This is a disregard for the power of civil society."
People like Taubert -- social workers, therapists, psychiatrists and educators -- are what Germany depends on now. They are expected to do what the police and intelligence services cannot achieve on their own: step in when parents run out of options, friends look the other way and neighbors fall silent.
In the bloody summer of 2016, this is perhaps the most important insight: A life without new attacks, and without fear of terror, can only exist if we begin to understand the rage of unstable young men -- and find answers to it.

A Dire Need for Initiatives

There is a lot of catching up to do, as the findings of a SPIEGEL survey taken in all of Germany's states demonstrate. The number of men prepared to use violence who are traveling to Syria and Iraq has risen over the years, but in Bavaria, for example, four relevant state ministries didn't begin cooperating closely to foster a network against Salafism until 2015. An initiative in the neighboring state of Baden-Württemberg began operations shortly before Christmas. An office titled "Salafism in the Saarland" was opened in the southwestern state on January 1 of this year. There has been little funding for these efforts to date. The eastern state of Thuringia, for example, spent exactly 16,005.76 euros ($17,889.64) on Islamism prevention in 2015.
At a time when terrorism is becoming more and more of a threat, the government and German society have been oddly disinterested in helping at-risk youth or bringing young radicals back from the fringes of society. But appealing to their hearts and minds could be a successful strategy. The biographies -- and possible pathologies -- of perpetrators of violence are often similar in terms of their infractions, whether they are on the left, the right or extremists.
"The disorders coincide with problematic social conditions and crises the perpetrators experience while growing up," says Andreas Zick, a social psychologist in the northwestern city of Bielefeld. In other words, family problems, trouble in school, the cutting of ties with old friends and emotional abnormalities are all factors that may accelerate radicalization -- and possibly lead to a fatal interest in carrying out a deadly rampage. These factors create a vacuum within them, and it's almost coincidental which group or ideology attempts to fill it.
Salafists and organizations like Islamic State (IS) do this very professionally. They lure people who are frustrated or who feel like outsiders by promising them the chance to belong and be important. The message they convey is simple: If others don't respect you, come to us. Right-wing extremists and nationalists used the same arguments to appeal to disillusioned young people.

Refugees at Risk

There is also another risk group: refugees from the crisis zones of the Middle East and other parts of the world.
Security officials have recently warned that IS fighters could be smuggling themselves into Europe within the flow of refugees. But it was only with the attacks in Ansbach and Würzburg that the general public became aware that refugees' unstable situation can make them susceptible to extremist thought.
Staffers at the nationwide telephone hotline for young people at risk for radicalization have been alarmed for some time. Since its establishment in 2012, the hotline, which is part of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, has dealt almost exclusively with young women and men who have grown up in Germany. But since last summer, a growing number of callers have been guardians of unaccompanied, underage refugees who have noticed radicalization among their charges, who have been showing other young people propaganda videos or openly sympathizing with IS. To date, Islamism experts have mentored 70 underage refugees reported through the hotline.
The staff at the Berlin Treatment Center for Torture Victims is also familiar with the problem. For more than a year, doctors there have had to reject most of the roughly 20 new inquiries they received every week, due to a lack of capacity and funding. But the Berlin doctors estimate that at least a quarter of all newly arriving refugees need psychological treatment. Many were tortured or witnessed people dying in gruesome ways in their native countries. 
Unaccompanied, underage asylum-seekers are especially at risk. In addition to the suffering the refugees experienced, they have lost or had to leave behind parents or siblings. Now they are alone in a foreign country with an unknown language.
Arab boys find it especially difficult to talk about their feelings, says Mechthild Wenk-Ansohn, a doctor and psychotherapist who has been working in the center's outpatient unit for 22 years. There is a bright spot, however: Thanks to a private donation, the Berlin facility will soon be able to augment the 20 therapy positions it currently has and hire a child and youth psychiatrist.
Other hospitals also do their best to help out when there is a need for therapists and interpreters. A clinic in the southwestern state of Saarland works with illustrated handbooks designed to help minors learn to control stress. The handbook recommends placing ice cubes on the skin, biting into chili peppers and doing pushups as distractions from stress. Young people are given personal mood barometers where they indicate three times a day whether they are in a good or an angry mood. This enables the counselors to gauge how well they are doing.

"Perhaps the best political prevention would be to create a stable situation for the refugees and provide immediate access to integrative measures, partly to avert the kinds of horrific acts we have recently experienced," says Wenk-Ansohn in Berlin.

What Makes People Kill?

It isn't easy to recognize commonalities in the biographies of the violent attackers of Würzburg, Munich and Ansbach. There still isn't enough available information, and the roles played by confidants and supporters remain unclear.
But the one thing that many individual perpetrators have in common is their sense of despair. From mad gunmen to Islamists, they tend to have narcissistic personalities, seek individual fame and hate everything else. The differences lie in what they do about it.
Britta Bannenberg, a criminologist in the central German city of Giessen, has studied the crimes and profiles of all young men who have gone on a rampage or have attempted to do so in Germany since the 1990s. They include the killing sprees in Erfurt, Emsdetten and Winnenden. All of the perpetrators have developed a "bundle of motives consisting of rage, hate and thoughts of revenge," which "is not based on rational reasons," Bannenberg writes in her study. "They often feel humiliated and badly treated, feelings those in their surroundings are unable to comprehend."
This is why it is difficult for relatives and friends to recognize potential signs in advance. It is true that lone perpetrators usually become socially withdrawn before committing their crimes and show little interest in the feelings of other people. Many of them listen to music with hate-filled lyrics or spend a lot of time playing violent computer games. But other young people with no emotional problems may behave in the same way without using weapons to attack others.
Bannenberg has established an interdisciplinary prevention program. A telephone hotline has been available to parents, teachers and friends since April 2015. The hotline has received 40 calls to date. Two-thirds of them were very serious and frequently led to investigations. In some cases, the police were able to seize weapons from the would-be perpetrators.
These days, psychiatrists are often better prepared to recognize potentially problematic cases. For instance, says Kai von Klitzing, a child and youth psychiatrist at Leipzig University Hospital, he and his colleagues become alarmed when young people who are at risk sever ties with doctors or refuse to engage in open conversations. "We inform the parents and speak to them openly about the threat it poses when a young person withdraws from treatment. We learned that from Winnenden, where the father of the perpetrator accused the doctors treating his son of having failed to tell him how dangerous he was." The Winnenden killing spree -- during which a 17-year-old student killed 15 people and himself near Stuttgart in 2009 -- also taught mental health professionals to ask whether the patient has access to weapons in his or his parents' environment, Klitzing adds.
But when do psychiatrists violate medical confidentiality and notify the police? When does the need to protect the public trump the need to protect the patient's right to confidentiality? By law, medical confidentiality can be lifted if there is a "current and otherwise unavoidable" threat to life and limb. The psychiatrist has the discretion to decide when this is the case.
Klitzing says that medical confidentiality should only be lifted in exceptional cases. "Many of our adolescent patients talk about fantasies of killing themselves or others. Talking openly about such fantasies with a therapist creates favorable conditions for limiting them -- and protects against the fantasies being turned into actions." Those who call for tougher rules in the name of prevention are in fact obstructing prevention, says the professor.

Need for Customized Strategies

The police in Germany have now developed their own guidelines for improving their ability to assess murderous threats. In their experience, they receive an increased number of these threats after an attack has just occurred. Is the person behind them a copycat or someone on the verge of committing a crime? In many cases, the initial clues come from a person's immediate environment. For instance, the schoolmates of David Sonboly, the Munich killer, reportedly said after the attack that they immediately knew that he was the killer.
When concerned fellow students, teachers or parents report that someone is showing a noticeable affinity for weapons or an interest in mass murders, trained police teams are available to prepare a threat assessment. 
In special cases, the police department convenes a case conference involving representatives from the school, the offices of public order and public health, and the psychiatric service. The police then compile a report containing information from all of these sources. Is the person suicidal? How concrete are the plans? Has the person already taken initial organizational steps? Does he or she have access to explosives or weapons? This can be followed by a targeted discussion with the individual in question, intensified counseling, confiscation of computers, house searches and commitment to psychiatric care.
Delusions of grandeur, a deep sense of worthlessness, emptiness: The same elements keep reappearing in the stories of people who perpetrate or develop an interest in these kinds of attacks. But each problem group requires nuanced responses and customized strategies, and those with the potential to go on hate-filled killing sprees need therapeutic help.
What about those who appear to suddenly turn to Islamism? How can they be reached and convinced to change their minds before they go to Syria and return as IS warriors?
The first preventive step is often to understand the narrative style that lures young people into the clutches of jihadists. Most of the videos disseminated by IS do not depict scenes of prisoners being beheaded or shot, as one might believe. Instead, the highly professional films convey a softly sketched, romanticized image of life in the caliphate. They show groups of laughing men in dapper uniforms, cleaning their weapons and then driving to the bazaar to buy gifts for the children and perfume for the women. They depict a cozy life in which people live both autonomously and as part of a large community.
Western governments attempt to offer something in reply to these tall tales. A team of advisers has formed at the EU level, with the goal of using research, social media training and its own communication strategies to debunk the myth of the idyllic "caliphate."
In Germany, the Federal Center for Civic Education has collaborated with well-known YouTube stars to develop videos intended to explain terms like "jihad" and "Salafism." A video by popular German YouTuber LeFloid on the question of "What does 'caliphate' mean?" was viewed more than 130,000 times. But the question is whether these videos are enough to deter young people from traveling to Syria or setting off a bomb in Germany.

'We Need More Prevention'

At the Legato prevention project in Hamburg, André Taubert has deliberately chosen a different approach, which he somewhat awkwardly describes as "systemic withdrawal counseling."
Taubert, a social worker and religious educator, describes a classic case: A 16-year-old girl converted to Islam after meeting a young Muslim on the Internet. She promised to marry him, even though she had never met him in person. She began wearing a headscarf, which she recently traded for a full veil.
The mother, whose parents were devout Christians, has no interest in religion and often quarreled with her daughter. "Conflicts within the family, as banal as they may be, are often the gateway to radicalization," says Taubert. On the other hand, he adds, he feels optimistic about the fact that the mother and daughter are still arguing, even after drifting apart. "This shows that the daughter still wants something from the mother." The mother, he says, expressly asked him to report on her case -- to embolden others.
Taubert generally does not advise young people, but rather their parents. They are the key to the problem, he explains. He tries to make them understand why the teenagers are at odds with them. He suggests that they approach their children in a more relaxed manner and surprise them with their reactions.
"In reality, it isn't about the religion. In my cases, it is irrelevant at first whether or not IS exists," he says. "What I'm doing here is classic family counseling." About 80 percent of the Islamists he has dealt with are from households with a single mother, where Islam hardly played a role at all.
Parents often believe that their child was brainwashed by Islamists, says Taubert. In his clinical experience, they expect that the radicalism can be washed out as quickly as possible. 
But it isn't that simple, he says. "Deradicalization is a long process." The adolescents need time to discover the value of love, respect, self-esteem and healthy social relationships at their own pace. According to Taubert, it's unrealistic to expect an Islamist to say, from one day to the next: "Now I'm the same loser I used to be."
The question is whether Germany has the patience for such long processes, and whether society will keep its nerve, even if there are more attacks.


A number of German states have now recognized the need to take action. Next year, the city-state of Berlin will earmark 860,000 euros for deradicalization projects as part of a municipal government program. This year, the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia tripled its budget for Salafism prevention. Things are also happening at the national level. "It's high time that we efficiently network the preventive activities of the federal and state governments," says Uli Grötsch, a domestic policy expert and member of the German parliament for the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). A federal office to coordinate the wide range of programs is also in the works.
In Hamburg, Taubert now feels more optimistic, at least more so than in the years when he was driving around northern Germany on his own to help the families of Islamists.
Why has Germany gotten off more lightly so far than France or Belgium? "Civil society has already come a long way," says Taubert, adding that Germany finally offers comprehensive counseling services. But the country cannot abandon this approach, he adds. "We don't need more police. We need more prevention."

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Russia has stopped using an Iranian air base for launching airstrikes on Syria for the time being, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman said Monday, just hours after the Iranian defense minister criticized Moscow for having "kind of show-off and ungentlemanly" attitude by publicizing their actions.Moscow, which had used the Shahid Nojeh Air Base to refuel its bombers striking Syria at least three times last week, confirmed that all Russian warplanes that were based in Iran have returned to Russia.A statement issued by the Russian Defense Ministry said Monday that as long as Iran agreed, Russia could use the Iranian air base again, "depending on the situation" in Syria.Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi told reporters in Tehran that the Russian airstrikes on militants in Syria were "temporary, based on a Russian request.""It is finished, for now," Ghasemi said, without elaborating.Last week, Russia announced it used the airfield, located some 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of the Iranian city of Hamedan. Iranian officials only confirmed Russia's presence a day later.Earlier Monday, state TV quoted Iran's defense minister as saying that Russia "will use the base for a very short and fixed span." The comments by Gen. Hossein Dehghan came after he chastised parliament this weekend for asking questions about Russia using the base.Responding to a question about why Iran didn't initially announce Russia's presence at the airfield, Dehghan appeared prickly on the state TV broadcast."Russians are interested to show they are a superpower to guarantee their share in political future of Syria and, of course, there has been a kind of show-off and ungentlemanly (attitude) in this field," he said.Dehghan's remarks also suggest Russia and Iran initially agreed to keep Moscow's use of the air base quiet. Its announcement likely worried Iran's Sunni-ruled Mideast neighbors, which host American military personnel.The Interfax news agency on Monday also quoted Russia's ambassador to Tehran, Levan Dzhagaryan, as confirming that all of Moscow's warplanes have been withdrawn from Iran. Dzhagaryan said, however, that he does "not see any reason" why the Russians can't use the Iranian base again.For Iran, allowing Russia to launch strikes from inside the country is likely to prove unpopular. Many still remember how Russia, alongside Britain, invaded and occupied Iran during World War II to secure oil fields and Allied supply lines. But while Britain withdrew, Russia refused to leave, sparking the first international rebuke by the nascent United Nations Security Council in 1946.Analysts have suggested Russia potentially leveraged Iran into allowing it to use the airfield over either economic or military interests, such as Tehran wanting to purchase Sukhoi-30 fighter jets or its deployment of Russian S-300 air defense missile systems. Russia initially held off on supplying the missile system to Tehran amid negotiations over Iran's contested nuclear program.Over the weekend, photographs of President Hassan Rouhani were published in Iranian state media near a Bavar-373 missile defense system. That system is designed to be the local equivalent of the S-300 — perhaps an Iranian signal back to Moscow that it's capable of defending itself without the Russian missile system.In his comments, Dehghan said the Bavar-373 can hit targets at the height of 27 kilometers (16.7 miles) — the same height the S-300 can reach."When we make Bavar-373 operational, we will not need to purchase another high-altitude and long-range air defense system," he said.Dehghan added that Iran still sees the Sukhoi-30 as "an appropriate fighting aircraft," though he acknowledged the U.S. could seek to block any fighter jet deal. The U.N. resolution enshrining last year's nuclear deal with Iran prohibits the supply, sale and transfer of combat aircraft to Iran unless approved in advance by the Security Council."The issue of purchasing the fighters has been raised and we have not heard any negative answer," he said. "We are negotiating to learn how we can do this with the restriction that can be raised for the Russians."Meanwhile, fighting continued Monday in Syria. In the northern Syrian city of Hasakeh, clashes again erupted between Kurdish fighters and pro-government militias, according to the Kurdish Hawar News Agency. The government and the Kurdish movement have shared control of the city since the early years of the Syrian civil war.Syrian government planes bombed Kurdish positions in Hasakeh last week as the struggle for predominance in the city escalated.Meanwhile, Turkish artillery on Monday attacked a U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish militia as well as Islamic State group positions across the border in Syria, according to Turkish media reports .Hurriyet newspaper said the attacks targeted positions north of the town of Manbij, which a Kurdish-led force recently captured from IS.The state-run Anadolu Agency says Turkey has increased security measures at its border opposite the Islamic State-held town of Jarablus, deploying tanks and armored personnel carriers.Turkish officials were not immediately available to confirm the report, which came as Syrian activists claimed that hundreds of Turkish-backed Syrian opposition fighters have gathered in the Turkish border area of Karkamis in preparation for an attack on Jarablus.Ankara is concerned about the growing power of U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish forces, who are linked to Kurdish groups waging an insurgency in southeastern Turkey.Also Monday, U.N. humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien urged all combatants in the battle for the Syrian city of Aleppo to agree to a 48-hour pause to allow desperately needed aid to be delivered, warning of a "humanitarian catastrophe unparalleled in the over five years of bloodshed" in Syria.  O'Brien told the Security Council that Aleppo is being bombed every day, including a dozen new attacks on Monday,___Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow and Philip Issa in Beirut contributed to this report.___Follow Nasser Karimi on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ncarrimi.

ABOARD THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER GARIBALDI (AP) — The leaders of Italy, France and Germany vowed Monday to boost joint European security efforts in the wake of Islamic extremist attacks as they made a symbolic bid to relaunch the European Union after Britain's vote to leave.From the deck of the Italian aircraft carrier Garibaldi, which is spearheading the EU's migrant rescue and anti-smuggling effort, Italian Premier Matteo Renzi, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Holland also promised new economic prospects to young people — albeit without any specific proposals or details.The three leaders travelled to the sun-soaked island of Ventotene to pay tribute to one of the founding fathers of European unity, Altiero Spinelli, and show common cause going into a bigger EU-wide summit next month in Slovakia.Spinelli, along with another intellectual confined to Ventotene in the 1940s by Italy's fascist rulers, co-wrote the "Ventotene Manifesto" calling for a federation of European states to counter the nationalism that had led Europe to war. The document is considered the inspiration for European federalism.Renzi invited his French and German counterparts to the island off Naples to remind Europe of its founding ideals as the EU forges ahead amid a spate of challenges, from slow economic growth to extremist violence, after Britain's vote to leave the bloc.The three placed three bouquets of blue and yellow flowers — the colors of the European Union — on Spinelli's simple white marble tombstone before meeting for an hour privately aboard the nearby Garibaldi."Many people thought that after Brexit, that Europe was finished. It's not like that," Renzi said from the deck. "We respect the choice of Britain's citizens, but we want to write a page for the future."Renzi, Merkel and Hollande all voiced support for improved internal and external defense measures, including better intelligence-sharing and beefed-up border defenses, following a spate of Islamic extremist attacks in France that have rattled Europeans' sense of security.Renzi said such measures were an "absolute priority" for the EU going forward."Europe should have a framework of protection. For security we need to have borders that can be guarded," Hollande said. "We also want there to be more coordination in the fight against terrorism."Merkel said the EU is currently facing "enormous challenges" and needed to work together especially on the security front at home and abroad."We feel that faced with Islamist terrorism and in light of the civil war in Syria that we need to do more for our internal and external security," she said. "Defense cooperation ... should be strengthened and the exchanges between our intelligence services must be intensified."The three also called for greater economic stimulus measures to create jobs, especially for young people, and improve investment opportunities.For Merkel, the visit to Ventotene marked the start of a string of meetings with other EU leaders to discuss the post-Brexit EU, with visits to Estonia, the Czech Republic and Poland in the coming days and meetings with the leaders of Slovakia and Hungary in Warsaw. Merkel has also invited leaders from the Nordic countries, the Netherlands, Austria and other eastern European nations for informal meetings at a government guest house in Germany."She wants to support a discussion that is as broad as possible, with as many actors involved as possible," her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said last week. That is aimed at ensuring that whatever emerges from the post-Brexit process "finds the widest possible acceptance in the member states and in the population."Merkel has shown little enthusiasm for grandiose changes to the EU's structure, preferring to make things work better rather than embark on major structural reform. France, for its part, wants greater EU integration and Hollande is a strong proponent of joining European defense efforts as Italy wants. However the French presidential campaign is getting into full swing and is likely to unleash anti-EU sentiment.Italy has a lot to gain from a reinvigorated EU as it copes with flat GDP, the migrant crisis and political uncertainties over a constitutional referendum this fall on which Renzi has staked his government's survival.Monday's mini-summit will serve as a warmup for an EU-wide summit in Bratislava in September designed to chart the EU's post-Brexit way forward. It follows an initial three-way huddle by Renzi, Merkel and Holland in Berlin in the days immediately following the June 23 British referendum.There, the three leaders pledged their commitment to European unity and plotted a common proposal to relaunch the European project focusing on three key areas: improving security, boosting economic growth and strengthening options and programs for young people.Charting a course is difficult until Britain formally begins the exit process, probably next year, and lays out proposals for its future relationship with the EU.___Winfield reported from Rome.

BEIJING (AP) — For the Olympics, it's so-long Rio, hello Asia.The next three Olympics are headed for relatively calmer ports of call in South Korea, Japan and China following the organizational drama surrounding the 2014 Winter Olympics in Russia and the just completed Summer Games in Brazil, although challenges remain, especially when it comes to finances and generating enthusiasm among home audiences. A look ahead to the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics and the 2022 Beijing Winter Games. All three countries have hosted the Olympics before and enjoy a shared reputation for prosperity and a deft hand at organizing major events.___PYEONGCHANG 2018: SLEEPY SKI RESORT FACES QUESTIONS OVER COSTS AND A LACK OF BUZZPyeongchang, a sleepy ski resort town on South Korea's mountainous east, is the smallest of the Asian hosts, and hopes to use the 2018 Winter Games to position itself as a major Asian winter sports destination.However, preparations for Pyeongchang 2018 have been noticeably less smooth than when South Korea's capital Seoul hosted the Summer Games in 1988. Organizers struggling with construction delays, local conflicts over venue construction and difficulties attracting domestic sponsorships. Such problems were easily avoided 30 years ago when the country's then-military dictatorship steamrolled any opposition.Even so, six new competition venues are about 80 percent complete, and a new high-speed rail line, designed to link the country's main gateway of Incheon airport with Pyeongchang in 90 minutes, will be up and running by January 2018.Despite a slow start, organizers say 90 percent of the domestic sponsorship target of $760 million will be met at the end of the year, when another round of test events will begin at Olympic venues.If the 1988 Summer Olympics marked the nation's arrival on the world stage as a modern industrialized economy and fully fledged democracy, the significance of the Pyeongchang games for South Korea is harder to pinpoint. The country is currently ranked the world's 11th largest economy by the International Monetary Fund and boasts a remarkable level of political stability despite the threat from communist North Korea. There is little obvious craving among the public for the recognition that large sports events bring.Excitement for the games has been tempered by concerns over the enormous costs involved, both for preparing and staging the Games and for maintaining the new facilities that might find little use once the party leaves town.Gangwon province, which governs Pyeongchang and drove the efforts to win the Games, has quarreled with the central government over who should pay the Olympic bills, which are now estimated at nearly $12 billion. The government has been eager to save money, but failed to convince Pyeongchang organizers and area residents to move some competitions and the opening and closing ceremonies to existing stadiums in other cities.Generating buzz is also a challenge because South Korea doesn't have a large footing in winter sports. While the country is competitive in speed skating, it remains a virtual unknown in skiing, snowboarding and ice hockey. It had an iconic winter sports figure in Olympic figure skating champion Kim Yu-na, but she has retired and involved with Pyeongchang only as an honorary ambassador.Yet optimists say the Olympics will bring much-needed infrastructure to one of South Korea's less-developed regions, which could become a winter sports destination for Asian tourists."Pyeongchang is not all green lights at this point. It will be and it's a very able country," IOC member Dick Pound of Canada said recently when asked if the IOC can relax now that Rio is out of the way and three Asian cities next.___TOKYO 2020: A 'SAFE PAIR OF HANDS,' EVEN WHILE COSTS SPIRALTokyo was clearly the most reassuring choice when it was selected over Istanbul and Madrid in 2013 for the 2020 Summer Games. Japan's capital city even billed itself as a "safe pair of hands" at a time of global unrest and economic turmoil.Spain was still wrestling with the aftershocks of the previous decade's financial crisis, and Turkey, with political unrest and the effects of the conflict in neighboring Syria. Also weighing on the minds of International Olympic Committee members were mounting concerns about construction delays in Rio, and security and astronomical cost overruns for the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia.The IOC opted to play it safe and go with a rich country with strong corporate sponsor support.That doesn't mean there haven't been major hiccups. Last summer, spiraling construction costs drove the government to scrap a futuristic plan by the late world-renowned architect Zaha Hadid for the main Olympic Stadium, raising concerns a new design might not be ready in time. Then the logo chosen for the Tokyo Games was ditched after plagiarism allegations.But Tokyo has the advantage of being a city that is in most senses already complete. There's no mad rush to build subway lines, or, as for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, elevated highways to unsnarl traffic. It's also one of the safest major cities in the world.Japan hopes the Olympics will boost tourism and the economy, as well as show off the country's technology, from driverless cars to super-sharp 8K television.Ballooning costs remain an issue: Japanese media in December put the figure at about $18 billion, although organizers have not confirmed that. Newly elected Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike has pledged to rein in costs, writing in a recent newspaper column that her team must become world-class cost accountants so that the Olympics don't hobble future generations with debt and mar Tokyo's skyline with white elephants.Some events have already been moved to existing facilities in the suburbs to avoid the cost of building new ones. The competition sites are spread around Tokyo and the surrounding area, rather than being in Olympic parks."It's going to need a lot of careful planning to get people from venue to venue," said IOC Vice President John Coates. "It's a more complex situation than Rio. On the positive side they have a very good transport infrastructure that connects all parts of the city. I think they're up for it, no worry about that, but you can't say it's going be easy."And then there's the heat. Tokyo in August is famously hot and humid, similar to Washington, D.C., and organizers are busy devising ways to keep athletes and fans cool. The 1964 Tokyo Games were held in October.___BEIJING 2022: EXPERTISE, FACILITIES, THOUGH NATURAL SNOW A RARITYHanding the 2022 Winter Olympics to China's capital Beijing was arguably one of the IOC's most pragmatic decisions.When the time came to vote, the pool of candidates had been reduced to just two: Beijing and Almaty, the capital of the landlocked Central Asian nation of Kazakhstan, which had never hosted an event on such a scale and whose dependence on hydrocarbon exports was a worry.Beijing, meanwhile, could skate on its record of hosting the highly praised 2008 Summer Olympics that equipped it with almost all the facilities needed to stage the indoor events for the Winter Games, such as ice hockey and figure skating.That allowed the bid organizers to cater to IOC Chairman Thomas Bach's drive for lower coasts and greater sustainability after the scandal over the $51 billion overall price tag associated with Sochi. Beijing estimates the total cost for operations and infrastructure at just $3 billion, while robust economic projections ensure strong support from the government and domestic sponsors.In keeping with the theme of re-use, the Beijing Games organizing committee's new offices are located in former iron ore storage silos at the former Capital Iron and Steel Works' sprawling factory site in the capital's western suburbs.The Beijing Games have not been without their controversies, chief among them the lack of steep mountains and natural snowfall in the area directly surrounding the typically bone-dry capital. That has required organizers to locate some of the skiing events in the adjacent province of Hebei, with travel eased by new high-speed rail links.Beijing's heavy winter air pollution is also a concern, although city planners say the closure of factories and retirement of smoke-spewing vehicles will help. And while China's ruling Communist Party continues to silence its opponents and repress Tibetans and other minorities, human rights doesn't appear to be a major factor in the run-up to the games, just as they were mostly cast aside during the 2008 events.Although China doesn't have much of a Winter Olympics tradition, games organizers have touted the games as a driving force for public participation in hockey, skiing and other winter sports.___Associated Press reporters Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea, Ken Moritsugu in Tokyo and sports writer Stephen Wilson in Rio de Janeiro contributed to this report.Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump's paid campaign staffers have declared on their personal social media accounts that Muslims are unfit to be U.S. citizens, ridiculed Mexican accents, called for Secretary of State John Kerry to be hanged and stated their readiness for a possible civil war, according to a review by The Associated Press of their postings.The AP examined the social media feeds of more than 50 current and former campaign employees who helped propel Trump through the primary elections. The campaign has employed a mix of veteran political operatives and outsiders. Most come across as dedicated, enthusiastic partisans, but at least seven expressed views that were overtly racially charged, supportive of violent actions or broadly hostile to Muslims.A graphic designer for Trump's advance team approvingly posted video of a black man eating fried chicken and criticizing fellow blacks for ignorance, irresponsibility and having too many children. A Trump field organizer in Virginia declared that Muslims were seeking to impose Sharia law in America and that "those who understand Islam for what it is are gearing up for the fight."The AP's findings come at a time when Trump is showing new interest in appealing to minority voters, insisting he will be fair in dealing with the 11 million people in the U.S. illegally and explicitly pitching himself to African-Americans, saying "what do you have to lose?"Since Trump declared his candidacy last summer, he has paid about 120 people on his campaign, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Over the weekend, the campaign reported about 70 people drawing salaries, a number that did not include a few dozen more working as consultants. A slew of hires in early August were not yet reflected in Trump's filings.The AP was able to review the accounts of only a minority of Trump staffers: Others set their accounts to private, some could not be found or identified with confidence as Trump campaign employees.The AP also reviewed the public social media accounts of more than three dozen employees of Hillary Clinton's far larger campaign staff and found nothing as inflammatory. One staffer said Trump's style of speaking reminded him of a roommate who had taken too many hallucinogenic mushrooms. AP also reviewed images attached to more than 19,000 stolen internal emails from the Democratic National Committee for racially or religiously inflammatory memes, finding nothing of note.The Clinton campaign declined to comment on its procedures for vetting staff. It employs more than 650 people, according to its FEC filings.One month ago, the AP sent written questions to the Trump campaign with examples of the posts. The campaign has not commented, despite several requests since.Veteran Republican campaign operatives said keeping an eye on staffers' social media postings has long been a standard practice."In vetting a prospective staffer, I'm not sure where the line would be for not hiring someone or simply asking them to take something down from social media, but there is a line," said Beth Myers, a former top Mitt Romney campaign aide.During Myers' work for Mitt Romney in the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, she said, social media was newer, so indiscrete or embarrassing photos were more often concerns than inflammatory views. Even outside social media, she stressed to the campaigns' staffers that what they said and did would reflect on the candidate who employed them. "Don't put anything in an email that you wouldn't want on the front page of The New York Times," she recalled telling staff. "The same thing I told my kids, I told my staffers."The AP found little questionable content in the ranks of Trump's top officials. The campaign's social media director, Dan Scavino, tweets prolifically but avoids discussing race and religion. Field organizers representing Trump's campaign around the country, however, have had no such reservations, either before or during their employment with the campaign. Their judgment matters beyond the campaign because the paid staff of winning presidential candidates often receives jobs in the next administration.Before being tapped as statewide director of coalitions, Craig Bachler of Bradenton, Florida, posted jokes in 2015 about Mexican accents superimposed over pictures of an overweight man wearing a sombrero. Bachler was named by the campaign as official staff in November, though there is no record he has been paid for his work. Bachler did not respond to a request for comment via Facebook or a message left at his office voicemail. After AP's inquiries, Bachler blocked access to an AP reporter, and his Facebook account — which included a photo of Bachler with Trump — was scrubbed to remove the offensive post.Teresa Unrue, a field organizer and graphic designer in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, for Trump's advance team, shared a video on her Facebook account July 11 — the week before the Republican National Convention — of a black man eating fried chicken while shaming fellow black people."Why are you mad about slavery?" the man asks. "Y'all weren't no damn slaves.""Had me crack'n up!! Thank you!" Unrue wrote of the video. "Please share this with people."In a short phone conversation, Unrue said she tried to keep her personal social media comments positive and referred questions to the campaign.Some posts fixated on stories of black-on-white violence with claims that news about such crimes was being suppressed."How about this little white boy being murdered by a black man," grassroots organizer Annie Marie Delgado of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, wrote in December 2014 post, one of a number highlighting crimes against white people before Trump declared his candidacy. Delgado also shared a discredited, hoax photo of the State Department's Kerry with Jane Fonda, and commented: "I say hang them!" She was paid $11,146 through April, according to campaign records.Fear or dislike of Muslims was a recurring theme. Though Trump at one point proposed temporarily barring foreign Muslims from entering the country and scrutinizing the activities of mosques, he has sometimes distinguished Islamic extremists who pose a risk and those who don't. "I love the Muslims," Trump said in September, expressing willingness to appoint one to his Cabinet.On Facebook, Mark Kevin Lloyd of Lynchburg, Virginia, who has been paid $36,000 as Trump's field director in the state, shared a post June 30 calling Islam "a barbaric cult." He shared a meme June 16, four days after the Orlando nightclub shooting by a heavily armed Muslim who professed allegiance to the Islamic State group. The meme said people should be forced to eat bacon before they can purchase firearms.Lloyd declined to talk to the AP without the Trump campaign's permission, citing his nondisclosure agreement with the campaign.Other campaign staffers also singled out Muslims for special scrutiny.Unrue shared the statement, "We need Islam control, not gun control."During her time with the campaign, Delgado deplored the appointment of a Muslim-American judge in New York."Step by step... this is how American culture will end," she wrote Feb. 27, saying it was only reasonable to believe that the judge would implement Sharia law.Delgado said in a telephone interview she stopped working for the campaign in April. She said she did not recall making some of the posts the AP asked her about and does not stand by others."If I read the whole thing, I probably wouldn't have posted it," she said of one post she shared, a short essay declaring that Muslims are inherently incapable of being good Americans.Phillip Dann, a field organizer in Massachusetts who recently relocated to Florida, was paid $6,153 between January and March. He shared a meme mocking "Muslim sympathizers." He also shared an article about Trump threatening to bring back waterboarding "or worse," and added "where is the gasoline?" Dann told the AP in a phone interview he had no antipathy against Muslims in general.Dann attributed inflammatory comments of other Trump staffers to the fact that the campaign had drawn on people inexperienced in politics. While he has been politically active for decades — originally as a leftist, he said — he described the field staff Trump acquired in the primary as unfamiliar with traditional campaign rules."We get hired because there was no one left," Dann said. In a later email, he acknowledged some of his and other staff postings were "clearly over the top" — but said that criticism of the posts would amount to intimidation.Scott Barrish, who earned $12,250 as Trump's political director for the Tampa Bay, Florida, region, took his views beyond social media posts. In 2011, he drew local press coverage for writing to the head of the nonprofit Council on American-Islamic Relations, an advocacy group for Muslims in the U.S., saying he was wise to its plans to establish a totalitarian theocracy in the United states."This is us vs. you," wrote Barrish. "In the great words of the late President Ronald Reagan, 'I win, you lose!'"Separately, Barrish tweeted in 2013 that he hoped America wasn't headed for civil war, but "if our freedoms must be defended against a tyrannical government, so be it.""Those comments at that time were made by me and were my own personal view," Barrish said in a brief interview with AP. He said he stopped working for Trump's campaign after the Florida primary. "I don't want to detract anything from the campaign."Barrish separately complained to editors at AP about its review of publicly accessible material on Trump employees' social media accounts, saying "the liberal media, yellow journalists are really grasping at straws with their ad hominem circumstantial logical fallacies!"Many accounts AP reviewed embraced conspiracy theories. Lloyd, the Virginia field director, said Obama is aiding the Iranian nuclear program as part of the president's "'final solution' to the Israel problem," a phrase evoking the Holocaust.Delgado, the Florida organizer, circulated a theory that the company Edible Arrangements LLC is funneling money to Hamas, a claim that the Anti-Defamation League, a U.S. Jewish organization, has repeatedly dismissed as false.Unrue posted a link to a website that alleged that the U.S. government assassinated Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died earlier this year after a history of heart trouble.Racially charged social media posts from Trump campaign employees and associates have already been a repeated source of embarrassment. Trump fired one adviser who had used a racial slur to describe Obama's children, and the campaign denounced Trump's longtime Mar-a-Lago butler for saying he would support dragging Obama from the White House and hanging him.Katie Packer, a 2012 Romney deputy campaign manager who opposes Trump, said the social media posts AP reviewed would have all been immediate disqualifiers for anyone who had applied for a campaign job — even if the postings weren't visible to the public."A comfort level with people who think this is OK is indicative of what you think is OK," Packer said. "Maybe the campaign just doesn't know about this, but that's malpractice."___Associated Press writers Chad Day and Ted Bridis in Washington and Nick Riccardi in Denver contributed to this story.Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump's paid campaign staffers have declared on their personal social media accounts that Muslims are unfit to be U.S. citizens, ridiculed Mexican accents, called for Secretary of State John Kerry to be hanged and stated their readiness for a possible civil war, according to a review by The Associated Press of their postings.The AP examined the social media feeds of more than 50 current and former campaign employees who helped propel Trump through the primary elections. The campaign has employed a mix of veteran political operatives and outsiders. Most come across as dedicated, enthusiastic partisans, but at least seven expressed views that were overtly racially charged, supportive of violent actions or broadly hostile to Muslims.A graphic designer for Trump's advance team approvingly posted video of a black man eating fried chicken and criticizing fellow blacks for ignorance, irresponsibility and having too many children. A Trump field organizer in Virginia declared that Muslims were seeking to impose Sharia law in America and that "those who understand Islam for what it is are gearing up for the fight."The AP's findings come at a time when Trump is showing new interest in appealing to minority voters, insisting he will be fair in dealing with the 11 million people in the U.S. illegally and explicitly pitching himself to African-Americans, saying "what do you have to lose?"Since Trump declared his candidacy last summer, he has paid about 120 people on his campaign, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Over the weekend, the campaign reported about 70 people drawing salaries, a number that did not include a few dozen more working as consultants. A slew of hires in early August were not yet reflected in Trump's filings.The AP was able to review the accounts of only a minority of Trump staffers: Others set their accounts to private, some could not be found or identified with confidence as Trump campaign employees.The AP also reviewed the public social media accounts of more than three dozen employees of Hillary Clinton's far larger campaign staff and found nothing as inflammatory. One staffer said Trump's style of speaking reminded him of a roommate who had taken too many hallucinogenic mushrooms. AP also reviewed images attached to more than 19,000 stolen internal emails from the Democratic National Committee for racially or religiously inflammatory memes, finding nothing of note.The Clinton campaign declined to comment on its procedures for vetting staff. It employs more than 650 people, according to its FEC filings.One month ago, the AP sent written questions to the Trump campaign with examples of the posts. The campaign has not commented, despite several requests since.Veteran Republican campaign operatives said keeping an eye on staffers' social media postings has long been a standard practice."In vetting a prospective staffer, I'm not sure where the line would be for not hiring someone or simply asking them to take something down from social media, but there is a line," said Beth Myers, a former top Mitt Romney campaign aide.During Myers' work for Mitt Romney in the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, she said, social media was newer, so indiscrete or embarrassing photos were more often concerns than inflammatory views. Even outside social media, she stressed to the campaigns' staffers that what they said and did would reflect on the candidate who employed them. "Don't put anything in an email that you wouldn't want on the front page of The New York Times," she recalled telling staff. "The same thing I told my kids, I told my staffers."The AP found little questionable content in the ranks of Trump's top officials. The campaign's social media director, Dan Scavino, tweets prolifically but avoids discussing race and religion. Field organizers representing Trump's campaign around the country, however, have had no such reservations, either before or during their employment with the campaign. Their judgment matters beyond the campaign because the paid staff of winning presidential candidates often receives jobs in the next administration.Before being tapped as statewide director of coalitions, Craig Bachler of Bradenton, Florida, posted jokes in 2015 about Mexican accents superimposed over pictures of an overweight man wearing a sombrero. Bachler was named by the campaign as official staff in November, though there is no record he has been paid for his work. Bachler did not respond to a request for comment via Facebook or a message left at his office voicemail. After AP's inquiries, Bachler blocked access to an AP reporter, and his Facebook account — which included a photo of Bachler with Trump — was scrubbed to remove the offensive post.Teresa Unrue, a field organizer and graphic designer in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, for Trump's advance team, shared a video on her Facebook account July 11 — the week before the Republican National Convention — of a black man eating fried chicken while shaming fellow black people."Why are you mad about slavery?" the man asks. "Y'all weren't no damn slaves.""Had me crack'n up!! Thank you!" Unrue wrote of the video. "Please share this with people."In a short phone conversation, Unrue said she tried to keep her personal social media comments positive and referred questions to the campaign.Some posts fixated on stories of black-on-white violence with claims that news about such crimes was being suppressed."How about this little white boy being murdered by a black man," grassroots organizer Annie Marie Delgado of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, wrote in December 2014 post, one of a number highlighting crimes against white people before Trump declared his candidacy. Delgado also shared a discredited, hoax photo of the State Department's Kerry with Jane Fonda, and commented: "I say hang them!" She was paid $11,146 through April, according to campaign records.Fear or dislike of Muslims was a recurring theme. Though Trump at one point proposed temporarily barring foreign Muslims from entering the country and scrutinizing the activities of mosques, he has sometimes distinguished Islamic extremists who pose a risk and those who don't. "I love the Muslims," Trump said in September, expressing willingness to appoint one to his Cabinet.On Facebook, Mark Kevin Lloyd of Lynchburg, Virginia, who has been paid $36,000 as Trump's field director in the state, shared a post June 30 calling Islam "a barbaric cult." He shared a meme June 16, four days after the Orlando nightclub shooting by a heavily armed Muslim who professed allegiance to the Islamic State group. The meme said people should be forced to eat bacon before they can purchase firearms.Lloyd declined to talk to the AP without the Trump campaign's permission, citing his nondisclosure agreement with the campaign.Other campaign staffers also singled out Muslims for special scrutiny.Unrue shared the statement, "We need Islam control, not gun control."During her time with the campaign, Delgado deplored the appointment of a Muslim-American judge in New York."Step by step... this is how American culture will end," she wrote Feb. 27, saying it was only reasonable to believe that the judge would implement Sharia law.Delgado said in a telephone interview she stopped working for the campaign in April. She said she did not recall making some of the posts the AP asked her about and does not stand by others."If I read the whole thing, I probably wouldn't have posted it," she said of one post she shared, a short essay declaring that Muslims are inherently incapable of being good Americans.Phillip Dann, a field organizer in Massachusetts who recently relocated to Florida, was paid $6,153 between January and March.

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Russia has stopped using an Iranian air base for launching airstrikes on Syria for the time being, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman said Monday, just hours after the Iranian defense minister criticized Moscow for having "kind of show-off and ungentlemanly" attitude by publicizing their actions.Moscow, which had used the Shahid Nojeh Air Base to refuel its bombers striking Syria at least three times last week, confirmed that all Russian warplanes that were based in Iran have returned to Russia.A statement issued by the Russian Defense Ministry said Monday that as long as Iran agreed, Russia could use the Iranian air base again, "depending on the situation" in Syria.Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi told reporters in Tehran that the Russian airstrikes on militants in Syria were "temporary, based on a Russian request.""It is finished, for now," Ghasemi said, without elaborating.Last week, Russia announced it used the airfield, located some 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of the Iranian city of Hamedan. Iranian officials only confirmed Russia's presence a day later.Earlier Monday, state TV quoted Iran's defense minister as saying that Russia "will use the base for a very short and fixed span." The comments by Gen. Hossein Dehghan came after he chastised parliament this weekend for asking questions about Russia using the base.Responding to a question about why Iran didn't initially announce Russia's presence at the airfield, Dehghan appeared prickly on the state TV broadcast."Russians are interested to show they are a superpower to guarantee their share in political future of Syria and, of course, there has been a kind of show-off and ungentlemanly (attitude) in this field," he said.Dehghan's remarks also suggest Russia and Iran initially agreed to keep Moscow's use of the air base quiet. Its announcement likely worried Iran's Sunni-ruled Mideast neighbors, which host American military personnel.The Interfax news agency on Monday also quoted Russia's ambassador to Tehran, Levan Dzhagaryan, as confirming that all of Moscow's warplanes have been withdrawn from Iran. Dzhagaryan said, however, that he does "not see any reason" why the Russians can't use the Iranian base again.For Iran, allowing Russia to launch strikes from inside the country is likely to prove unpopular. Many still remember how Russia, alongside Britain, invaded and occupied Iran during World War II to secure oil fields and Allied supply lines. But while Britain withdrew, Russia refused to leave, sparking the first international rebuke by the nascent United Nations Security Council in 1946.Analysts have suggested Russia potentially leveraged Iran into allowing it to use the airfield over either economic or military interests, such as Tehran wanting to purchase Sukhoi-30 fighter jets or its deployment of Russian S-300 air defense missile systems. Russia initially held off on supplying the missile system to Tehran amid negotiations over Iran's contested nuclear program.Over the weekend, photographs of President Hassan Rouhani were published in Iranian state media near a Bavar-373 missile defense system. That system is designed to be the local equivalent of the S-300 — perhaps an Iranian signal back to Moscow that it's capable of defending itself without the Russian missile system.In his comments, Dehghan said the Bavar-373 can hit targets at the height of 27 kilometers (16.7 miles) — the same height the S-300 can reach."When we make Bavar-373 operational, we will not need to purchase another high-altitude and long-range air defense system," he said.Dehghan added that Iran still sees the Sukhoi-30 as "an appropriate fighting aircraft," though he acknowledged the U.S. could seek to block any fighter jet deal. The U.N. resolution enshrining last year's nuclear deal with Iran prohibits the supply, sale and transfer of combat aircraft to Iran unless approved in advance by the Security Council."The issue of purchasing the fighters has been raised and we have not heard any negative answer," he said. "We are negotiating to learn how we can do this with the restriction that can be raised for the Russians."Meanwhile, fighting continued Monday in Syria. In the northern Syrian city of Hasakeh, clashes again erupted between Kurdish fighters and pro-government militias, according to the Kurdish Hawar News Agency. The government and the Kurdish movement have shared control of the city since the early years of the Syrian civil war.Syrian government planes bombed Kurdish positions in Hasakeh last week as the struggle for predominance in the city escalated.Meanwhile, Turkish artillery on Monday attacked a U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish militia as well as Islamic State group positions across the border in Syria, according to Turkish media reports .Hurriyet newspaper said the attacks targeted positions north of the town of Manbij, which a Kurdish-led force recently captured from IS.The state-run Anadolu Agency says Turkey has increased security measures at its border opposite the Islamic State-held town of Jarablus, deploying tanks and armored personnel carriers.Turkish officials were not immediately available to confirm the report, which came as Syrian activists claimed that hundreds of Turkish-backed Syrian opposition fighters have gathered in the Turkish border area of Karkamis in preparation for an attack on Jarablus.Ankara is concerned about the growing power of U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish forces, who are linked to Kurdish groups waging an insurgency in southeastern Turkey.Also Monday, U.N. humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien urged all combatants in the battle for the Syrian city of Aleppo to agree to a 48-hour pause to allow desperately needed aid to be delivered, warning of a "humanitarian catastrophe unparalleled in the over five years of bloodshed" in Syria.  O'Brien told the Security Council that Aleppo is being bombed every day, including a dozen new attacks on Monday,___Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow and Philip Issa in Beirut contributed to this report.___Follow Nasser Karimi on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ncarrimi.

QINGDAO, China and ROCKVILLE, Md., Aug. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Synutra International, Inc. (Nasdaq: SYUT), ("Synutra" or the "Company"), which owns subsidiaries in China that produce, distribute and sell nutritional products for infants, children and adults, today announced financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 ended June 30, 2016.
Mr. Liang Zhang, Chairman and CEO of Synutra, commented, "We reported an increase in our core Nutritional Food segment sales in spite of the negative foreign exchange impact, along with an increase in our milk formula sales volume, when compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2016. In RMB terms, net sales of our milk formula products increased by 4% year-over-year, the first such quarter since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.  Adding to the sales of this segment was the liquid milk product under our DutchCow brand which we launched in January 2016 and have seen its sales double each month since then. We continued to expand our ThumbMama membership community and develop our ThumbMall e-commerce platform.  We also continue to expand our product offerings across a wider range of mom and baby 
categories."
Mr. Zhang continued, "Due to the prolonged adjustment period for one particular equipment supplier, we experienced further delays at our French project and now expect the French project to be fully operational in September 2016.  The expectation for our 100% French-produced infant formula is to be available for retail sales in China in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The product quality that will come from our French project and will boost the confidence of our customers and elevate sales.  We also remain confident in our ability to capitalize on consolidation opportunities under new Chinese government regulations as a leading infant formula player in China."
First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Financial Results 
Net sales were $77.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, a decrease of 5.4% from $82.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Net sales from the Company's Nutritional Food segment, which mainly includes branded powdered formula products and liquid milk products, were $74.4 million, or 95.5% of net sales, in the first quarter. This represents an increase of 0.9% from the prior year period's sales of $73.7 million, or 89.6% of net sales. This increase was mainly attributable to sales of the newly launched ultra-high temperature liquid milk products under the DutchCow brand, and an 8.8% increase in milk formula sales by volume, partially offset by a 10.2% decrease in average selling price, compared to the prior year period. Sales of powdered formula products increased to 5,892 metric tons in the first quarter, 
compared to 5,414 metric tons in the prior year period. Average selling price was $12,227 per metric ton, compared to $13,618 per metric ton in the prior year period. The decrease in average selling price was mainly due to a negative foreign exchange impact, and the change of product mix from higher priced Super brand infant formula products towards lower priced private label and adult formula products.
Net sales from the Nutritional Supplement segment were $652,000, or 0.8% of net sales, compared to $8.1 million, or 9.8% of net sales, in the prior year period. This segment mainly consists of ingredients such as chondroitin sulfate sold to certain international pharmaceutical companies.  The decrease was primarily due to a temporary halt of orders by two major customers of this segment.
Net sales from Other Business, which mainly includes imported whole milk powder and whey protein powder sold to industrial customers, were $2.8 million, or 3.6% of net sales, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to $546,000, or 0.7% of net sales, in the prior year period. Sales under this segment are opportunistic and fluctuate from quarter to quarter.
Gross profit was $34.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to $41.9 million in the prior year period. Gross margin for the Nutritional Food segment was 46.8%, a decrease from 55.7% in the prior year period, primarily due to decreased average selling price, higher raw material costs and the newly launched liquid milk products which carried a slightly negative margin due to greater promotional activity during the launch period. Gross margin was 43.6%, a decrease from 50.9% in the prior year period. In addition to the decline in gross margin for the Nutritional Food segment, overall gross margin was negatively impacted by the negative gross margin for Other Business segment and the decreased gross margin for the Nutritional Supplement segment in the first quarter.
Selling and distribution expenses were $11.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to $12.7 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower employee bonus costs associated with lower sales from high premium products. Advertising and promotional expenses were $7.3 million in the first quarter, compared to $10.3 million in the prior year period, as the Company re-adjusted its advertising and promotion campaign schedule. Selling and distribution, and advertising and promotion expenses combined accounted for 24.1% of sales, compared to 28.0% in the prior year period. 
Income from operations was $4.9 million, or 6.2% of sales, in the fiscal first quarter, compared to $12.5 million, or 15.2% of sales, in the prior year period. Included in income from operations was a non-recurring loss on long term purchase contract of $2.8 million related to the delay of the French project. The Company previously agreed to start purchasing raw milk from Sodiaal for its French project beginning January 2016, and had to compensate Sodiaal for the inability to accept raw milk as its project was delayed.  The Company now expects its French facility to be fully operational in September 2016. 
Net foreign currency exchange loss was $2.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to a gain of $331,000 in the prior year period. This loss was primarily due to the depreciation of the RMB against the USD and the Euro as one of the Company's PRC subsidiaries, whose functional currency is RMB, had borrowed significant loans denominated in USD and Euro.
Net loss was $156,000, compared to a net income of $8.0 million in the prior year period. Net income attributable to common stockholders was $43,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, or nearly zero per basic share, compared to $7.6 million, or $0.13 per basic share, in the prior year period.
Balance Sheet
As of June 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $79.7 million and restricted cash of $214.3 million, including the current and non-current portions. Net accounts receivable decreased to $18.6 million from $29.9 million as of March 31, 2016. The Company's inventory position increased to $108.5 million from $98.4 million as of March 31, 2016. Total debt was $535.6 million, including $136.7 million of short-term debt and $70.4 million of long-term debt due within one year, representing an increase of $29.4 million from last quarter. Net debt, which is total debt net of cash and restricted cash, increased to $241.6 million from $197.3 million as of 
March 31, 2016.
Fiscal 2017 Financial Outlook
As disclosed in the previous quarter, the Company believes that the previously announced revenue and net income forecast for fiscal 2017 will be difficult to achieve, due to a) the delay of its French project impacting the business in the current fiscal year, in terms of both lower sales growth as French project's stimulation effect will be more limited towards the later part of this year, and increased contract loss; b) the recovery of whole milk prices in the global market turned out to be temporary.  Once the French project is operational, the Company will be a net seller, rather than a buyer, of raw milk powder; and c) the depreciation in RMB against USD and EURO accelerated faster than previous forecasts.  The Company's products are denominated in RMB while the bulk majority of its production costs are based in USD or EURO, which negatively impacted the Company's profitability. 
The Company now expects total net sales for fiscal year 2017 to be between $500 and $550 million, and net income to be between $15 and 20 million. The Company remains optimistic about its prospects for continued strong growth above the industry average, once its French facility is fully operational. The Company has not factored in additional one-time expenses or the foreign exchange impact into its fiscal 2017 forecast, aside from its fiscal first quarter results.

QINGDAO, China and ROCKVILLE, Md., June 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Synutra International, Inc. (Nasdaq: SYUT), ("Synutra" or the "Company"), which owns subsidiaries in China that produce, distribute and sell nutritional products for infants, children and adults, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2016 ended March 31, 2016.
Mr. Liang Zhang, Chairman and CEO of Synutra, commented, "Our fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 results continued to reflect several business headwinds in our Nutritional Food segment, including a competitive environment, lower birth rates during the Year of the Sheep, an uncertain regulatory environment and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. We have also experienced some challenges with our Nutritional Supplement segment.  For our French project, the equipment adjustment of our two drying towers took longer than expected, and we now expect the French project to be fully operational in July 2016 and expect start importing our 100% French-produced infant formula into the Chinese market in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.  Due to the delay in our ability to start purchasing milk from Sodiaal, 
we also incurred a one-time $8.8 million loss under our long-term purchase agreement with Sodiaal."
Mr. Zhang continued, "During the March quarter, we remained committed to developing our Offline-to-Online membership service program. We now have approximately 10,000 part-time promoters servicing customers on our public WeChat account Thumb Mama. We are also excited to see the continuous expansion of our WeChat-based Thumb Mall e-commerce platform.  We have also introduced ultra-high temperature liquid milk products under our Dutch Cow brand in January 2016, and have seen the monthly sales for this product double each month through May 2016.  In the long-term, we expect to capitalize on industry consolidation as a leading IMF producer in China, particularly as we begin to import premium products from our French facility in the next two quarters."
Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2016 Financial Results 
Net sales were $86.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, a decrease of 21.8% from $110.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Net sales from the Company's Nutritional Food segment, which mainly includes branded powdered formula products, were $80.4 million, or 93.4% of net sales, in the fourth quarter. This represents a decrease of 23.5% from the prior year period's sales of $105.1 million, or 95.4% of net sales. This decrease was due to a 7.2% decrease in milk formula sales by volume and a 17.6% decrease in average selling price, compared to the prior year period. Sales of powdered formula products decreased to 6,827 metric tons in the fourth quarter, compared to 7,356 metric tons in the prior year period. Average selling price was $11,774 per metric ton, compared to $14,283 
per metric ton in the prior year period. The decrease in average selling price was mainly due to the change of product mix from higher priced Super and specialty infant formula products towards lower priced private label and adult formula products, higher discounts, and a negative foreign exchange impact. 
Net sales from the Nutritional Supplement segment were $1.1 million, or 1.2% of net sales, compared to $4.6 million, or 4.1% of net sales, in the prior year period. This segment is primarily comprised of ingredients such as chondroitin sulfate sold to certain international pharmaceutical companies.  The Company's two largest clients in this segment temporarily withheld their orders in the fourth quarter as one worked on upgrading product specifications and one managed down its raw material inventory.
Net sales from Other Business, which mainly includes imported whole milk powder and whey protein powder sold to industrial customers, were $4.7 million, or 5.4% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, compared to $550,000, or 0.5% of net sales, in the prior year period. The increase in sales from Other Business was primarily due to more sales of excess milk powder.
Gross profit was $38.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, compared to $54.2 million in the prior year period. Gross margin for the Nutritional Food segment was 48.8%, a decrease from 51.4% in the prior year period, as the decrease of raw material costs for this segment, in particular whole milk powder prices, was more than offset by the lower average selling price. Gross margin was 45.2%, a decrease from 49.2% in the prior year period.  In addition to the decline in gross margin for the Nutritional Food segment, overall gross margin was negatively impacted by the negative gross margin for the Nutritional Supplement segment in the fourth quarter.
Selling and distribution expenses were $10.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, compared to $14.5 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to lower employee bonus costs associated with lower sales. Advertising and promotional expenses were $12.2 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $10.9 million in the prior year period, as last year's expenses in this category benefited from a one-time government subsidy. Selling and distribution, and advertising and promotion expenses combined accounted for 26.6% of sales, compared to 23.1% in the prior year period, due to lower operating leverage. 
Income from operations was $476,000, or 0.6% of sales, in the fiscal fourth quarter, compared to $16.6 million, or 15.0% of sales, in the prior year period. Included in income from operations was a non-recurring loss on long term purchase contract of $8.8 million related to the delay of the French project. The Company previously agreed to start purchasing raw milk from Sodiaal for its French project beginning January 2016, and had to compensate Sodiaal for the inability to accept raw milk as its project was delayed by six months. 
Net foreign currency exchange loss was $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, compared to a gain of $2.1 million in the prior year period. This loss was primarily due to the depreciation of the RMB against the USD and the Euro as one of the Company's PRC subsidiaries, whose functional currency is RMB, had borrowed significant loans denominated in USD and Euro.
Net income was $53,000, compared to net income of $24.3 million in the prior year period. Net income attributable to common stockholders was $96,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, or near zero per basic share, compared to $24.1 million, or $0.42 per basic share, in the prior year period.
Full Year ended March 31, 2016 Financial Results 
Net sales for fiscal 2016 were $365.0 million, a decrease of 11.8% from $413.9 million in the prior year. Net sales from the Nutritional Food segment decreased by 15.0% to $328.6 million, or 90.0% of net sales, compared to $386.8 million, or 93.4% of net sales, in the prior year. 
Gross profit was $176.8 million, a decrease of 6.7% from $189.6 million in the prior year. Gross margin was 48.4%, compared to 45.8% for the prior year. Gross margin for the Nutritional Food segment was 53.4%, compared to 48.7% in fiscal 2015.
Income from operations was $46.5 million, compared to $73.7 million in the prior year.
Net income was $21.0 million, a decrease of 70.9% over $72.0 million in the prior year. One-time items that impacted net income include the $8.8 million loss under the Sodiaal contract. Non-operating items that impacted net income include $12.2 million of foreign currency losses in aggregate. Net income attributable to common stockholders was $20.2 million, or $0.35 per basic share, compared to $69.5 million, or $1.21 per basic share, in the prior year. 
Balance Sheet
As of March 31, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $102.7 million and restricted cash of $206.2 million, including the current and non-current portions. Net accounts receivable increased to $29.9 million from $24.0 million as of December 31, 2015. The Company's inventory position increased to $98.4 million from $86.9 million as of December 31, 2015. Total debt was $506.2 million, including $95.2 million of short-term debt and $95.5 million of long-term debt due within one year, representing an increase of $32.2 million from last quarter. Net debt, which is total debt net of cash and restricted cash, increased to $197.3 million from $184.7 million 
as of December 31, 2015.
Fiscal 2017 Financial Outlook
The Company expects total net sales for fiscal year 2017 to be between $500 and $550 million, and net income to be between $25 and $30 million. The increase in sales will be driven by the expected increase in the sales of powdered formula products, the increase in the sales of liquid milk as this product continue to be launched, and the increase in the sales of bulk milk powder and bulk whey protein powder, as the Company's French project is expected to begin operations in July 2016 and produce bulk powder. Net income growth for fiscal 2017 is expected to be limited as sales increases are expected to be more weighted towards lower margin liquid milk and bulk powder and the Company expects greater depreciation and interest expenses due to the commencement of operations at its new French 
facility. The Company has not factored in one-time expenses or foreign exchange impact into its fiscal 2017 forecast.

QINGDAO, China and ROCKVILLE, Md., Feb. 5, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Synutra International, Inc. (Nasdaq: SYUT), ("Synutra" or the "Company"), which owns subsidiaries in China that produce, distribute and sell nutritional products for infants, children and adults, today announced financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 ended December 31, 2015.
Mr. Liang Zhang, Chairman and CEO of Synutra, commented, "Our third quarter of fiscal 2016 results continued to reflect impacts from the competitive promotional environment and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. However, we were still able to achieve meaningful growth in margin expansion this quarter due to lower raw material costs and our ongoing effective controls over discounts and expenses. Our progress in the strategic online-to-offline ThumbMama platform contributed to our performance in the December quarter, as the number of active part-time promoters on our WeChat-based ThumbMama online social network platform surpassed our number of full-time in-store promoters, and the sales from the ThumbMall online channel, which is linked to the ThumbMama platform, continued to grow quickly as a percentage of 
total sales."
Mr. Zhang continued, "We have experienced some delays in the development of our French project related to the two spray drying towers, and we started the trial operations of the mixing and canning facility in January 2016 with formal production of the entire project now expected to be on or before April 1, 2016. We expect to import canned products into China with all required licenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Our total budget for the French project is expected to increase marginally due to additional staffing and raw material procurement costs caused by the delay.  Going forward, we remain committed to our sustained pricing strategy, maximizing operational efficiency and further developing brand equity and customer loyalty. We also intend to capitalize on industry consolidation to establish Synutra as a leading IMF producer in China, particularly as we import premium products from our French facility in the future."
Third Quarter Fiscal 2016 Financial Results 
Net sales were $109.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, a decrease of 5.3% from $115.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Net sales from the Company's Nutritional Food segment, which mainly includes branded powdered formula products, were $96.3 million, or 88.1% of net sales, in the third quarter. This represents a decrease of 9.7% from the prior year period's sales of $106.6 million, or 92.4% of net sales. This decrease was due to a 4.5% decrease in milk formula sales by volume and a 5.5% decrease in average selling price, compared to the prior year period. Sales of powdered formula products decreased to 7,647 metric tons in the third quarter, compared to 8,006 metric tons in the prior year period. Average selling price was $12,588 per metric ton, compared to $13,316 per 
metric ton in the prior year period.
Net sales from the Nutritional Supplement segment were $10.6 million, or 9.7% of net sales, compared to $5.6 million, or 4.9% of net sales, in the prior year period. This segment is primarily comprised of ingredients such as chondroitin sulfate sold to certain international pharmaceutical companies. 
Net sales from Other Business, which includes imported whole milk powder and whey protein powder sold to industrial customers, were $2.4 million, or 2.2% of net sales, in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, compared to $3.1 million, or 2.7% of net sales, in the prior year period. The decrease in sales from Other Business was primarily due to less unusable raw materials available to be sold in bulk to industrial customers due to the use of infant-grade whole milk powder, which contains a higher percentage of powder that can go directly into the Company's final milk formula products under its dry-mixing production method.
Gross profit was $55.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, compared to $52.7 million in the prior year period. Gross margin was 50.7%, an increase from 45.7% in the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to the lower cost of raw materials used for products in the Nutritional Food segment during the December quarter, partially offset by the decreased average selling price. Gross margin for the Nutritional Food segment was 57.0%, an increase from 49.6% in the prior year period.
Selling and distribution expenses were $14.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, compared to $15.9 million in the prior year period. Advertising and promotional expenses were $12.8 million in the third quarter, compared to $10.5 million in the prior year period. Selling and distribution, and advertising and promotion expenses combined accounted for 24.6% of sales, compared to 22.8% in the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to an increase in online advertising expenses for the Company's specialty formula products, partially offset by lower employee bonus costs associated with lower sales.
Income from operations was $20.6 million, or 18.9% of sales, in the fiscal third quarter, compared to $19.2 million, or 16.7% of sales, in the prior year period. The increase in operating margin was primarily driven by the lower cost of whole milk powder.
Net foreign currency exchange loss was $2.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, compared to a gain of $504,000 in the prior year period. This loss was primarily due to the depreciation of the RMB against the USD and the euro as one of the Company's PRC subsidiaries, whose functional currency is RMB, had borrowed significant loans denominated in USD and euro. 
Net income was $12.3 million, compared to net income of $17.9 million in the prior year period. Net income attributable to common stockholders was $12.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, or $0.21 per basic share, compared to $17.3 million, or $0.30 per basic share, in the prior year period.
Nine Months ended December 31, 2015 Financial Results 
Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 ended December 31, 2015 were $278.9 million, compared to $303.8 million in the prior year period. Net sales from the Nutritional Food segment were $248.2 million, or 89.0% of net sales, compared to $281.7 million, or 92.7% of net sales, in the prior year period. 
Gross profit was $137.9 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2016, compared to $135.4 million in the prior year period. Gross margin improved to 49.4% from 44.6% in the prior year period. 
Income from operations was $46.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2016, compared to $57.2 million in the prior year period.
Net income was $20.9 million, compared to $47.8 million in the prior year period. Net income attributable to common stockholders was $20.1 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2016, or $0.35 per basic share, compared to $45.4 million, or $0.79 per basic share, in the prior year period. 
Balance Sheet
As of December 31, 2015, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $65.2 million and restricted cash of $224.1 million, including the current and non-current portions. Net accounts receivable increased to $24.0 million from $19.9 million as of September 30, 2015. The Company's inventory position decreased to $86.9 million from $93.5 million as of September 30, 2015. Total debt was $474.0 million, including $98.7 million of short-term debt and $75.0 million of long-term debt due within one year, representing a decrease of $26.0 million from last quarter. Net debt, which is total debt net of cash and restricted cash, decreased to $184.7 million from $209.0 million
 as of September 30, 2015.
Fiscal 2016 Financial Outlook
As disclosed in the previous quarter, the Company believes that the previously announced revenue and net income forecast for fiscal 2016 will be difficult to achieve, mainly due to expected lower sales in the Nutritional Food segment and the foreign exchange loss impacting the business in the current fiscal year. The Company now expects total net sales for fiscal year 2016 to be between $375 and $400 million, and net income to be between $30 and 35 million. The Company remains optimistic about its prospects for continued strong growth above the industry average for fiscal 2017 and beyond, once its French facility is fully operational.
Recent Developments
The board of directors of the Company (the "Board") appointed Mr. Yalin Wu as independent director of the Board, effective January 21, 2016.
The Board received a non-binding proposal letter on January 14, 2016, from Mr. Liang Zhang, Chairman and chief executive officer of Synutra, and an affiliated entity of his, proposing a "going-private" transaction to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of the Company not already owned by the Buyer Group for US$5.91 in cash per Share. The Board then formed an independent special committee on January 21, 2016, composed of Ms. Jinrong Chen, Mr. Lei Lin and Mr. Yalin Wu, and elected Ms. Jinrong Chen as its chairperson, to consider the non-binding proposal letter.

Civil unrest has erupted in Griffon, a democratic island nation in the Pacific. The neighboring country of Orion, ruled by a military junta, is gearing up for invasion. An Orion-backed terrorist group has already begun spreading fear and panic in Griffon, setting off bombs and sending waves of refugees fleeing. The government of Griffon is on the brink of collapse.


In New York, the United Nations Security Council convenes, passing resolutions and urging a return to peace and stability in Griffon.
A large military force is assembled. It consists of 25,000 soldiers from 26 countries, 45 warships, five submarines and more than 200 aircraft. Their mission: Neutralize the terrorists, secure the waters around Griffon and put a stop to Orion's aggression.
The battle for the fictitious Griffon is the scenario of the world's largest international maritime exercise, known as the "Rim of the Pacific," or RIMPAC for short, which came to a close in early August after four weeks of drills. This year's event was planned to the last detail, including the wording of the fake UN resolutions. Since the Cold War, the US Navy has regularly invited its allies and countries along the Pacific Rim to practice forming a broad military coalition in and around the Hawaiian Islands and Southern California. Training ranges from the formation of a multinational chain of command to the coordination of complex weapons systems, landing operations and the joint sinking of warships.
This year's exercise took place 75 years after the Japanese attacked the US naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, which provoked the Americans to enter the fray of World War II. Japan's subsequent defeat and the Allied victory established the US as the dominant military power in the Pacific region.
RIMPAC 2016 was marked by the participation of one country in particular: China. Rather than take on an observatory role like other nations, China contributed five warships, 1,200 officers and soldiers, marines and a team of combat divers.







DER SPIEGEL
Graphic: Major Pacific Powers


China's participation had been long negotiated, yet it was still not without controversy. Why, politicians and military experts in the US wondered, should the Navy invite a country pursuing such an aggressive foreign policy in South Asia? Why should America's sailors cooperate with a country that is pumping billions into its maritime forces, thereby making itself the US' new Pacific rival? Why should Chinese officers be provided insights into the tactics, technology and standard operating procedures of the US military and its allies when one day these very strategies might have to be used against China? 

Rising China

For a good two years, Beijing has been erecting and fortifying bases in the South China Sea along islands and reefs -- territory that several US allies claim as their own.
In early July, an international tribunal in The Hague rejected Beijing's claims of sovereignty over nearly all of the waters between China and Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. China declared the court procedure a "farce" and threatened to enforce an Air Defense Identification Zone along its southern coast. Nevertheless, Washington did not rescind its invitation and the Chinese showed up for the mock maneuvers.
What does this apparent contradiction mean for bilateral relations between China and the US -- relations that President Barack Obama's National Security Advisor Susan Rice has called "the most consequential in the world today?"
This question goes beyond the current crisis in the South China Sea. Can a global power like the US share its hegemony with a new rival? Can a rising power like China, which itself feels entitled to world power status, create a new order without injuring the old one?
Answers to these questions can be found in the Pacific, at RIMPAC, where the geopolitical interests of China and the US collide.

Fictional Allies

At the foremost pier in Pearl Harbor, where the murky water of the military port swirls into the cobalt blue of the Pacific Ocean, the elite divers of the American and Chinese navies train side by side. It's a rare and unusual sight: muscular, tattooed Americans next to the ascetic Chinese in their pristine uniforms.
"It's a simple scenario," says a US lieutenant, who only gives his rank, in line with the protocol of his unit. "The bad guys are on Orion. We and the Chinese are helping the good guys here on Griffon. We're on the same side," he says, grinning.
The "bad guys" may have sunk a submarine or laid mines. On this particular morning, the Americans are showing the Chinese how they use underwater welding equipment to sever the steel wires or chains that anchor mines and how they attach rescue hooks to sunken ships. In the afternoon, the Chinese will show the Americans how they do it.
A Chinese officer films one of his American counterparts as he prepares for a dive. "Up until this point, we do it the same way," says the man with the camera, who gives his name and rank as Hu Pei, lieutenant commander from the Qingdao naval base.
The artificiality of the situation and the discomfort of the officers is palpable. America and China are only on the same side in the fictional world of this naval warfare exercise. In real life, they wouldn't trust one another an inch.
"The positions of China and the US in the Pacific contradict each other diametrically," says Shi Yinhong, the director of the Center for American Studies at the Renmin University of China and an advisor to the government in Beijing. Following the ruling of the Hague tribunal in July, China declared its position "more radically than ever before in the history of the People's Republic," Shi says.
First, Beijing demanded that all islands and reefs within a specific area of the South China Sea be recognized as Chinese. Second, it declared the rest of this huge area, with all its shipping routes and raw materials, to be an exclusively Chinese economic zone. Third, China expected the world to view its claims as historically justified and non-negotiable.

Chinese dredging vessels are purportedly seen in the waters around Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.


Past Chinese leaders thought the same way, Shi says, but today China is strong enough to enforce its claims. And so the conflict between China and America has been laid bare: "Washington insists on its preponderance in the Pacific, but Beijing isn't willing to tolerate it anymore. America isn't the only country that considers itself an exceptional power -- China does too. On this point, both sides are uncompromising," Shi says.
Why, then, would the Chinese leadership send some of the country's most modern warships and best soldiers to an exercise hosted by its rival?

Joe Biden Arrives

Shi shrugs his shoulders. "It is a tactic of reason and common sense," he says. "If others perceive you to be expansionist, then you want to show how approachable you are despite everything."
The USS John C. Stennis is one of 10 nuclear-powered aircraft carriers of the Nimitz class. These ships are more than 300 meters long and they have crews of 5,500 people and up to 90 aircraft onboard. They each lead a so-called strike group, made up of cruisers, destroyers and supply ships that are part of an ongoing rotation of US naval forces around the world.
The John C. Stennis Strike Group, or JCSSG for short, spent the last few months deployed in the western Pacific. It arrived in Pearl Harbor in late June to take part in the RIMPAC exercise. When it was about 140 miles (225 km) south of Oahu, all fighter jet operations were temporarily suspended to make way for a prominent guest who was arriving via Osprey, a hybrid aircraft that looks like a cross between an airplane and a helicopter.
As the Osprey landed on the deck of the Stennis, the force of the wind from the rotors caused the man in the blue suit who climbed out of the aircraft to stagger. It was US Vice President Joe Biden, and he had come to express his thanks to the crew of the aircraft carrier.
There had been trouble in the western Pacific. Twice this spring, Chinese and American planes buzzed each other so closely that they almost slammed into one another. Each side pointed a finger at the other for the close call. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called upon America to cease its provocations, while the US Secretary of Defense retorted that China was erecting a "Great Wall of self-isolation" with its artificial islands. In late April, Beijing denied the Stennis entry to the port of Hong Kong -- a very unusual diplomatic slight in US-China relations.
Around a thousand sailors and officers were already waiting as Biden took the podium in the carrier's hangar deck. "Sailors, I'm here for one main reason," he said. "That's to say thank you. Thank you for being part of the greatest naval fighting force in the history of the world." Stability in the Pacific region is "absolutely indispensable" to the security of the US. "President Barack Obama and I have made it crystal clear that the United States is a Pacific nation. We're going to be present in the region, and we're going to be active in the region -- for as long as any of you are alive." 

A Tense Close Call

Few US politicians have so consistently advocated for US interests in the Pacific as Biden. He, President Obama as well as former Secretary of State and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton were all behind the US' "pivot to Asia." By 2020, around 60 percent of US warships will be deployed in the Pacific and no longer, as in past decades, in the Atlantic, the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf.
Half of the global population lives on the Pacific Rim, Biden said. It's only a matter of time before the region is responsible for half of the world's economic activity. And the biggest chunk of this economic activity will presumably come from China.
Joe Biden knows the Chinese leader Xi Jinping better than most politicians in the US. He was nurturing his relationship with Xi back when the Chinese politician was the Communist party chief of Shanghai. On the sidelines of his visit to the Stennis, Biden explained that he had racked up more than 20 hours of conversations with Xi over the years, including one memorable evening during his last visit to Beijing in December 2013.
At the time, China had just announced that it would enforce an Air Defense Identification Zone in the East China Sea, alarming Japan and South Korea most of all. It was the same measure with which Beijing is threatening America's allies in the South China Sea today.
Biden said Xi asked him what he expected from China. He replied that, "We're going to fly B-52s through it," Biden recalled, referring to China's assurances that it would "adopt defensive emergency measures" against any aircraft that entered its newly claimed airspace and didn't identify itself, report a flight plan and stay on radar. "We're coming. We do not recognize it. Period." Biden told the Chinese it would not be wise to enforce it. 
China didn't shoot down either of the two US bombers; instead it just lodged a diplomatic complaint. But seldom before had the world's biggest old and new powers come so close to an armed conflict.
So why would America invite such a hostile neighbor to take part in its warfare exercises?

Headquarters of the US Pacific Fleet

Vice Admiral Nora Tyson wears a bright white uniform as she arrives at a park overlooking Pearl Harbor. The bungalows between the palm trees could belong to a university -- that is, if some of those buildings weren't in fact windowless bunkers. It's inside this idyllic park that the headquarters of the US Pacific Fleet is located.
Tyson hails from Memphis, Tennessee, and she speaks with a strong Southern accent that she never lost in her long and unusual career. She's the first woman to ever lead a strike group. She's also the first woman to command an American fleet -- the Third Fleet, which is hosting the RIMPAC maneuver.
So why did she invite China to RIMPAC, when the country is frightening its neighbors?
Tyson has served in places as distant as Singapore and Brussels and she has a cool demeanor when it comes to her "theater," as high-ranking US military officials call their areas of command. "We neighbors of the Pacific are different and don't want to be the same," she says evasively. "But the best way to avoid military conflicts is by building trust. That's why China is part of RIMPAC." Officers from such different cultures will have a tougher time firing on each other "if they have roasted marshmallows together."
In the meantime, China is sending "fishing boats" into the South China Sea whose crews are armed and have already clashed with coast guard ships from neighboring countries. Marshmallows aren't going to change that. Who can guarantee that no incident will arise that then spirals out of control?
Tyson admits that danger exists, but that's why a colleague is currently in Beijing. "If an incident like that were to occur, trust me, the telephones will be ringing in the offices of Admiral Richardson or Admiral Wu." Admiral John Richardson is the Chief of Naval Operations and Wu Shengli is his Chinese counterpart. Why else, Tyson asks, would China and the US hold regular video conferences at the command, fleet and navy levels?







U.S. Navy
US Navy Vice Admiral Nora Tyson: Officers will have a tougher time firing on each other "if they have roasted marshmallows together."


The Americans also confer with the Russians, but they cancelled their participation in RIMPAC -- a decision that was only logical among adversaries. Instead, in mid-July, a Russian destroyer suddenly appeared off the coast of Hawaii, with its crew viewing the maneuvers from up close. The Russian officers could be seen with the naked eye from the deck of the warship USS America.
"This was not unexpected," says Tyson. "Those are international waters out there, everyone can sail around. They should just take care and make sure not to get too close to one of our sinking execises." The Russians behaved very professionally, she said. 
America, Tyson says, wants to see the peaceful development of the Pacific Rim states, including the "peaceful rise of China" that leaders in Beijing have been speaking of for years. Still, even if the rise of such diverse countries as China, Japan, the Philippines and North Korea were peaceful and could happen simultaneously, would America truly want that in the case of China?

No Chinese 'Monroe Doctrine'

China is different from its neighbors -- it is much larger and, like the United States itself once had, it has far-reaching ambitions. The US' rise to the status of a global power happened according to a doctrine announced in 1823 by President James Monroe that remained in effect for nearly 200 years. It stated that outsiders like the established European powers, or later the Soviet Union, had no business in North or South America. The American continent was the sphere of influence of the United States, and those who opposed this view could count on a military response.
It appears that China's leadership has something similar in mind today -- although this doctrine seems not to apply to all of Asia, but rather to the East and South China Seas as its area of influence.


"China will not announce any Monroe Doctrine of its own," says government advisor Shi Yinhong. "Saying something like that publicly would lead to a serious confrontation with the other powers." 
However, he added, that does not apply to the "thoughts and subconscious desires" of many Chinese. "Because if you look at China's behavior, at its concrete actions, it becomes clear that Beijing is claiming predominance in East Asia and the West Pacific."
In the maneuvers, America and China are fighting on the same side in order to protect the "good guys" on Griffon from the "bad guys" on Orion. Ultimately, though, RIMPAC is just a game. 




NEW YORK (AP) — "Suicide Squad" and "Sausage Party" remained no. 1 and no. 2 at the weekend box office in North America, while a trio of newcomers failed to make much of a dent.


One of them, Paramount's $100 million remake of "Ben-Hur," bombed outright. The film opened with just $11.2 million, according to final box-office figures Monday, despite its high price tag for MGM and Paramount.

CITRONELLE, Ala. (AP) — The Latest on the massacre of five adults at a home in south Alabama (all times local):


Residents of a southwest Alabama town where five people were slain are trying to raise money to help the victims' families pay funeral expenses.


Relatives of some of the victims have started an online fundraiser, and a plastic jug for donations sits on the counter of a convenience store a couple miles from the scene of the massacre near Citronelle, located in southwest Alabama.


A clerk at the store, Dawn Sullivan, says she knew all the victims and was related to one by marriage. She says the community is coming together to help survivors of the slaying.


Residents say all the victims were related by blood or marriage.


Authorities say a Mississippi man will be charged with murder in the slayings. Authorities say the man killed five people at a house where his estranged girlfriend had sought refuge from him. The bodies were found Saturday.


Authorities say the suspect being held in Mississippi after five adults were slain in south Alabama has signed papers allowing for his extradition to Alabama, where he will face murder charges.


Alabama authorities say the slain included a 22-year-old woman who was five months pregnant and four adults ranging in age from 23 to 35. Their bodies were found Saturday.


Stanley McLeod, the sheriff in Greene County, Mississippi, said in a statement that Derrick Dearman initially refused extradition following his arrest.


But McLeod said that by Monday morning, he had signed the necessary paperwork and was expected to be taken back to Alabama by Mobile County sheriff's officials.


A Mississippi sheriff says the man accused of slaughtering two women and three men at a home in south Alabama walked into his agency's office and said he had killed at least one person.


Greene County Sheriff Stanley McLeod released a statement Monday that noted that Derrick Dearman said while surrendering that he "had killed someone or more than one person" in Citronelle, Alabama.


Alabama authorities say the slain included a 22-year-old woman who was five months pregnant and four adults ranging in age from 23 to 35. Their bodies were found Saturday at the home in Citronelle.


Mobile County sheriff's Capt. Paul Burch said Dearman attacked the victims as they slept and abducted his estranged girlfriend and an infant from the home. They were found alive.


Authorities in south Alabama say the five people slain in a massacre at a south Alabama home included a 22-year-old woman who was five months pregnant and four other adults ranging in age from 23 to 35.


A sheriff's captain says the suspect attacked them as they slept and then abducted his estranged girlfriend and an infant from the home. Both of them were found alive.


The bodies of the two women and three men were found Saturday afternoon inside the home in Citronelle, a small town 30 miles northwest of Mobile.


Investigators say 27-year-old Derrick Dearman of Leakesville, Mississippi, faces six counts of capital murder — one count for each of the victims plus an additional murder charged since one of the victims was pregnant.

BELLEFONTE, Pa. (AP) — A man who says he was the boy observed being sexually abused by Jerry Sandusky in a Penn State shower more than 15 years ago gave conflicting statements to authorities and was considered to lack credibility, investigators said during an appeal hearing Monday.


The man has settled with Penn State based on a claim that he is Victim 2 and was seen by graduate assistant Mike McQueary being attacked by Sandusky, then an assistant football coach, in 2001. The man gave differing statements to Sandusky's lawyers and to police investigators, according to testimony, and neither side called him to the stand during the 2012 trial.


The identity of Victim 2, and the man's claim to be Victim 2, figures into Sandusky's bid for a new trial or to have charges dismissed because of a reference during lead prosecutor Joe McGettigan's closing argument before a jury convicted Sandusky of 45 counts of abuse involving 10 victims.


McGettigan told jurors there were "others unknown to us, to others presently known to God but not to us." The appeals hearing is Sandusky's chance to prove his claim that McGettigan was referring to Victim 2 and so he knew that statement was false.


The man who claims to be Victim 2 contacted Sandusky's then-lawyer, Joe Amendola, soon after Sandusky was first charged in November 2011 and gave a statement saying he was in the shower that night but had not been abused. He had also made a similar denial of abuse to investigators in September 2011, testified Cpl. Joseph Leiter, a retired state police investigator.


But he subsequently hired attorney Andrew Shubin, who testified Monday on the second day of the hearing that he believes his client is Victim 2 and was raped by Sandusky, who was in court. He is serving a 30- to 60-year sentence.


Asked if he had any doubts, Shubin said he was not sure how to answer that. But he said the man is his client and he would not represent anyone he did not believe.


Shubin declined to answer when asked whether he ever tried to hide the man's whereabouts from police and prosecutors, citing attorney-client privilege.


"I have never spoken about that issue and never waived that privilege," Shubin testified.


Anthony Sassano, an agent with the attorney general's office, testified that he heard from someone — he said he wasn't sure whom — that the man was "hidden at hunting camp somewhere so we couldn't find him to interview him."


Sassano said that the man contradicted himself to agents when asked if he ever told anyone of abuse and that his drawing of the locker room where he claims to have been seen by McQueary did not fit the actual Lasch Building locker room.


That "led me to believe he was never in that particular locker room," Sassano testified.


Prosecutors did not find the man credible, Sassano said.


"I don't know if they formed their opinion off my opinion or they had their own separate opinion," Sassano said. "We all arrived at the same conclusion."


Testimony on Monday also delved into claims of improper leaks of material from the grand jury that investigated Sandusky before he was charged. The hearing is expected to conclude Tuesday.


Sandusky testified during the first day of the hearing and strongly denied his guilt. He has already lost direct appeals to the state's Supreme and Superior courts and is now seeking relief under the Post-Conviction Relief Act that is confined to newly discovered evidence, constitutional violations and ineffective lawyering.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Former President Bill Clinton defended the work of his charitable foundation Monday, telling supporters that it had "improved millions of lives around the world" but needs to change if his wife, Hillary Clinton, wins the White House.


The former president outlined the Clinton Foundation's accomplishments and planned shift in scope in an email to about 500,000 supporters. It came hours after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called the foundation "the most corrupt enterprise in political history" adding, "It must be shut down immediately."


Bill Clinton announced last week that the foundation will no longer accept contributions from foreign governments and corporations if his wife, the Democratic presidential nominee, is elected. The ex-president, who oversees the foundation with daughter Chelsea Clinton, also said he would hold his final Clinton Global Initiative meeting next month in New York regardless of the election's outcome.


"Since Hillary began her presidential campaign in 2015, Chelsea and I have made it clear that the work the Clinton Foundation started should continue if Hillary is elected, but that changes would be necessary," Bill Clinton said in the email. "While it would be presumptive to assume a victory in November, now that Hillary is her party's nominee, it would be irresponsible not to plan for it."


The changes aim to address criticism from Republicans and some Democrats that the foundation has created a significant conflict of interest as Hillary Clinton seeks the presidency. While Trump has donated to the foundation previously, he has charged Hillary Clinton with creating a "pay-for-play" scheme at the State Department through the work of the foundation.


Defending the foundation's mission, Bill Clinton pointed to more than 11.5 million people in more than 70 countries who have gained access to HIV/AIDS drugs at a much lower cost and millions of American students who have healthier food and more physical education options because of the foundation. He also noted the foundation's work around the globe, including efforts to help improve Haiti's sustainability, foster job training in Latin America and support farmers in East Africa.


The ex-president said in the event of another Clinton presidency, the foundation's work, funding and his role in it would raise questions that would need to be resolved "in a way that keeps the good work going while eliminating legitimate concerns about potential conflicts of interest."


If Hillary Clinton is elected, the former president said the foundation would accept contributions only from U.S. citizens, permanent residents and U.S.-based independent foundations, whose names would continue to be disclosed on a quarterly basis. He said the official name would be changed from the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation to the Clinton Foundation. And he said he would step down from the board and no longer raise money for it.


Bill Clinton said that much of the foundation's international activities would be transitioned to other organizations to continue that type of work.


John Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign, said in a statement on Monday that the foundation had laid out "unprecedented steps" that it would take if Hillary Clinton is elected. He urged Trump to "come clean" with the electorate about the business mogul's "complex network of for-profit businesses" that are in debt to big banks, the Bank of China and business groups with ties to Russia.

Twenty years after a stinging Olympic failure in Atlanta, Great Britain has risen from the ashes to become a sporting "superpower" thanks to a judicious, if ruthless, allocation of lottery and public cash to the sports most likely to win medals. 
Rival nations were left confounded by Team GB’s 27 golds (of 67 medals won) in Rio, putting them in second place behind the United States with 46.
Liz Nicholl, the chief executive of UK funding agency UK Sport, declared on Sunday that "we are one of those sporting superpowers now", while the Mirror newspaper called it “Britain’s Golden Age”.
But rather than revolutionary coaching, technology or even, as some more bitter opponents suggested,  doping, it is the investment of hundreds of millions of pounds by the National Lottery (introduced in 1994, two years before Atlanta, where Britain won a single gold medal) and public cash in the last two decades that has paid off handsomely for Team GB.


But the allocation of money has been ruthlessly targeted, its only goal being the development of “elite” sports likely to gain medals.
Sports that don’t meet pre-Games medal targets have seen their funding cut, meaning grassroots facilities. Basketball, for example, which doesn’t stand a chance of winning on a global stage, has been starved of National Lottery cash.
Even if total funding was increased by 3%, to a total of 330 million pounds compared to the four years leading up to the 2012 London Olympics, only 20 disciplines were allocated funding ahead of the Rio Games.
Professor Steve Haake, head of the Advanced Wellbeing Research Centre at Sheffield Hallam University, told FRANCE 24 that while the allocation of funding to elite sports “could be seen as ruthless”, it was also a pragmatic way of “making sure taxpayers get value for money – we need to know that if we spend all this money we actually have a chance of winning”.
Haake also defended the fact that “fringe sports” were left out. “They get plenty of investment from English and Scottish authorities,” he said.
“The strategy is to put money into sports and to spend it wisely on the best athletes, the best coaches and the best infrastructure,” he said. “It is a common sense approach to achieve success.”
'Conveyor effect'
He also hinted that he expects such funding to continue and for Team GB to shine again at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
“If you fund an elite sport like cycling and continue to do so when it is successful, you get a conveyor effect that goes through into the future,” he said.
According to British media estimates, the government spent just £5 million  per year funding Olympic sport before the disastrous 1996 Atlanta Games, where Britain finished with just one gold medal and 15 overall.
That sum increased to more than £50 million in the four years before the 2000 Sydney Games where Britain won 11 golds and 28 medals overall.
Before London 2012 it was spending more than £80 million a year -- and Team GB won 65 medals and came third in the table.
UK Sport chairman Rod Carr, a British yachting coach at three Olympics, sees the origin of today's success in a failure of funding at the 1996 Games in Atlanta when he was team manager.
"The reality was at the time of Atlanta, John Major (prime minister at the time) was kicking the whole lottery act through parliament and we were doing the best we could," Carr told AFP.
"Well, in the late 90s it would have been a bit of an act of faith, but by the early 2000s it was pretty obvious there was a linear relationship between medals and funding."

A widespread crackdown on dissent is fuelling tension across Turkey, which has seen a rise in hate crimes against minorities – including a recently reported attack against a well-known transgender activist in Istanbul.
Turkey’s Daily Sabah reported that the badly burnt and mutilated body of Hande Kader, a 22-year-old LGBT activist and sex worker, was found on August 8 by the roadside in a residential area of Istanbul.
Although DNA evidence has yet to confirm the remains belong to Kader, the director of a gay rights group said her boyfriend and some friends had positively identified the body.
Emirhan Deniz Çelebi, the director of SPoD, a national LGBT organisation based in Istanbul, joined other LGBT associations in condemning what they believe is deliberate silence by the country’s mainstream media in the wake of the activist’s death.
"We are not equal,” he said.
After Kader was arrested during an equal rights rally and faced down police water cannons during last year's Gay Pride parade, she became a symbolic figure in the LGBT community.
“We are being murdered and they do not hear our voices, because the rules in Turkey don't protect us”, said Deniz Çelebi.
 


Advocating more rights 
Outraged supporters launched a social media campaign to raise awareness of Kader’s death and the plight of the LGBT community in Turkey. On Twitter they shared the hashtag #HandeKaderSesVer (MakeSomeNoiseForHandeKader), while on Change.org a petition was circulated to advocate for better protections for those in the community.
Last Thursday local activists took their cause to the capital, holding a press conference outside the parliament to highlight the daily risks confronting LGBT members.
Kader’s murder comes less than two weeks after the beheading of a gay Syrian refugee whose body was found not far from where Kader was discovered.
Muhammed Wisam Sankari, who had fled war-torn Syria, was found decapitated after being raped and assaulted. He could only be identified by the clothes he was wearing.
Minorities targeted
After last month’s failed coup in which the government instituted a state of emergency, the rights of minorities including gays, women and LGBT members have been whittled away.
While the Turkish capital has been a safe haven for many fleeing persecution and war in neighbouring Syria and Iraq, hate crimes against LGBT people have increased.
“Since the coup-attempt, a number of my transgender friends have called me and talked about how they were discriminated against because of their ID Cards and appearance,” Deniz Çelebi said.
Turkish lawyer and LGBT rights advocate Levent Pişkin said Erdogan’s rampant purges have exacerbated the fears of minorities.
“Actually, LGBT people in Turkey have never had legal rights,” said Pişkin.
“But we knew there were judicial mechanisms to support us. Nowadays, most people feel more vulnerable.”
Shift away from secularism
Although homosexuality is not a crime in Turkey as it is in many other Muslim countries, homophobia remains widespread.  Almost 80 percent of Turks believe homosexuality is “morally unacceptable” according to a 2013 study by the US think tank PEW Research Center. 
Pişkin said Kader’s death is symptomatic of a country shifting away from secularism.
“An Islamic tendency has gradually been getting stronger,” said Pişkin.
“The government has preferred war over strengthening our democracy. Therefore, our democratic rights and one’s right to life hang by a thread.”
LGBT activists will stage a demonstration on Sunday in Istanbul's İstiklal Avenue to raise further awareness about Kader's death.

The woman who shared photos of herself in bed with Olympic champion Usain Bolt is reportedly the widow of one of Rio de Janeiro's most dangerous drug lords. 20-year-old student Jady Duarte unwittingly sparked controversy when she shared the somewhat compromising images of herself and Bolt kissing and cuddling on WhatsApp pictures after celebrating the sports star's 30th birthday on Sunday (21 August.)Details of her ominous underworld connections have since emerged after it was revealed that Duarte has two children with Douglas Donato Pereira, also known as Diná Terror. Wanted for at least 10 violent crimes and described as being "violent and bloodthirsty" he appeared to revel in the fear he evoked in others.The drugs kingpin operated in the Faz Quem Quer shantytown in the north of Rio and living up to his chilling moniker wreaked terror in the area.The self-proclaimed 'Lord of War' bragged about being the 'terror of policemen' and frequently posted pictures of himself posing with guns on Facebook.He was killed in a shootout with elite police troops in March this year after they tracked him down to a house in the favela.Following his death, Jady posted photos with the gangster on her Facebook page, declaring her undying love for him. One post read: "In eternity, I will be with my love the way I always wanted, because in heaven all the time is time to be happy. God will take you in, it's my hope that in eternity I will see you."Jady met Usain Bolt at De Bracos Albertas club where the sprinter was celebrating his third and last Olympics where he triumphed, winning three gold medals. The flamboyant star was in the mood to party as he was also celebrating his 30th birthday and was caught on video twerking with another woman at the Rio club.And while Jady claims that she didn't know Bolt was famous when he approached her, it seems the Olympian knew little about his new acquaintance or her connections to a drug baron.After the revelations of her encounter with Bolt made worldwide headlines the 20-year-old claimed she was left mortified by the attention. "It's very negative," she told local newspaper Extra. "I never wanted to be famous, I'm dying of shame."
Usain Bolt was photographed in bed with 20-year-old student Jady DuarteJady Duarte/WhatsAppDescribing her brief liaison with Bolt she added: "He sent a security guard to call me over. We spoke quickly. But at that moment I didn't know it was him, because there were many Jamaicans who looked similar. It was not a big deal. It was normal. I'd rather not talk about it - in order not to complicate matters. Like I said, it was normal," she explained.Bolt, has a girlfriend of two years at home in Jamaica - 26-year-old Kasi Bennett, who he calls his 'First Lady'. The athlete's sister Christine Bolt-Hylton claimed that the couple were due to be engaged.Midst the controversy surrounding his encounter with Jady in Rio, Bolt left Rio before the closing ceremony and is expected to receive a hero's welcome when he returns to Jamaica Mail Online reports.However, he wasn't about to let the media attention on his personal life put a dampener on his triumph in Rio. In his last tweet before he left, he posted a picture of himself striking his famous pose and wrote in Portuguese: "We came, we saw, we conquered. Rio I have endless love for you."The sprinter, who will now retire from Olympic competition following the Games, is expected to take on an ambassadorial role in athletics and has also signed a lifetime contract with Nike thought to be worth an estimated $30m a year.

Taiwan-based 19-year-old has singing engagements across the region after her hugely successful "Malaysia Chabor" and "I miss you" go viral. VIDEO INSIDE
PETALING JAYA: Easily mistaken for a K-Pop artiste, Joyce Chu is however every bit Malaysian and hit the big time in the music scene after a YouTube video of her singing about being a Johorean woman, spiralled off the charts in May 2014.
Today the Taiwan-based 19-year-old is jet-setting across the region, promoting her Malaysian identity from Thailand to Australia for singing engagements, spots on TV shows and even a movie.
Reporting on the young Malaysian’s astounding success, Singapore’s TodayOnline said Chu’s first YouTube video titled “Malaysia Chabor” amassed 15.5 million views and prompted the singer-songwriter to pen other songs that have proven equally successful.
The undeniably catchy “I Miss You”, out last November, got her 19 million views and features the delicately pretty woman in a different outfit and hairstyle against a different backdrop in every frame. The music video also spawned two spin-offs – “I Miss You 2.0” and “I Miss You 3.0”, the news portal said.
It’s no coincidence then that Chu was soon offered her acting debut in the hit Singapore cosplay-themed movie, Young And Fabulous, opposite Ah Boys To Men star Joshua Tan and Mediacorp actor Aloysius Pang.
From here it was on to China’s music reality TV show Heroes of Remix, featuring her pop idol of all time, Leehom, who personally picked her to be on his team.
“Besides the fact that he’s super handsome and talented, he’s someone I’ve loved since young. To be able to meet him in person is beyond my wildest dreams!
“Leehom would guide me on what song choices to make, what I should wear on stage … He even asked me to compose a rap together with him. The only thing I could say at that time was, ‘wow, just wow’,” she gushed.
Now in Singapore to discuss the direction of her first full-length album with record executives, Chu said, “We decided that the style should be young, vibrant and acoustic. It will have more dance and definitely more of my own compositions,” she said.
Obviously consumed by her love of composing and singing, Chu said she is sometimes hit by inspiration from out of the blue and rushes to put her thoughts down before losing her momentum.
“Once I was flying home from KL (Kuala Lumpur) to JB, a melody popped into my head which I quickly recorded on my phone. Once I got home, I rushed into my piano room and just churned out a complete song. When ideas come, one shouldn’t delay in getting it out!” TodayOnline reported her as saying.
Sharing her wisdom with young hopefuls who want to make it big in the music industry, Chu said, “Take part in auditions for experience and exposure. Acme Academy in Singapore, run by my artiste management for instance, often holds auditions to groom budding talents. I myself have attended courses by them. Finding a good teacher is very important.”

WASHINGTON U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump insisted on Monday he was not changing his stance on immigration, despite a comment from a top aide who said his plan to deport 11 million illegal immigrants was still under review."I'm not flip-flopping. We want to come up with a really fair but firm answer," Trump told Fox News. He did not elaborate on his policy.
Trump had planned to deliver a speech on Thursday in Denver about his immigration policy, but that event has been postponed, a campaign official confirmed. On Sunday, Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, was pressed repeatedly in a CNN interview on whether Trump would go ahead with a call he made in November to set up a "deportation force" to remove undocumented immigrants.
"To be determined," Conway said. She also said Trump was committed to a "fair and humane" approach to those living in the country illegally.
Trump's immigration position has been a centerpiece of his campaign. When he announced he was running for president, he called for construction of a wall along the nation's border with Mexico to stop undocumented immigrants from entering the country. He has insisted that he will make Mexico pay for the wall.Trump also said that Mexico was sending "rapists" and "criminals" across the border.

WASHINGTON A judge ordered the State Department on Monday to review and determine the potential release of 14,900 documents, most of which are believed to be emails to or from Hillary Clinton, that turned up in an FBI investigation of her use of a private email server as secretary of state.    The documents are part of a cache that the FBI turned over to the State Department at the end of its probe into Clinton's use of the server. The Federal Bureau of Investigation found Clinton was "extremely careless" with sensitive information by using the private server but recommended against bringing charges against Clinton. She has been dogged by questions about the issue throughout her run for the White House.    The State Department could make public the first batch of emails in October, weeks before the Democratic nominee faces Republican rival Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election. State Department employees are due to craft a timeline for the release at a meeting on Sept. 23. The revelation of more emails after 55,000 pages of emails were turned over by Clinton last year could provide continued fodder for opponents who have seized on the email issue to charge she is untrustworthy.The announcement by U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg, who is overseeing a group of lawsuits seeking to make Clinton's emails public, came the same day a conservative watchdog group, Judicial Watch, made public a batch of Clinton's emails obtained through a lawsuit. Judicial Watch says that the emails show donors to the Clinton family's charitable foundation seeking the access to her during the period she was secretary of state from 2009-2013.    The 14,900 documents referred to by Boasberg are believed to include emails that were not included among the 55,000 pages of emails that Clinton previously turned over to the State Department after her use of a private email server and private email account became public last year.
    The new documents are believed to consist chiefly of emails to or from Clinton, said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity, and may include a mix of personal and work emails. Some of the emails were found on the servers of people she or her staff were communicating with.Clinton, who is currently leading Trump in opinion polls ahead of the election, has said she did not compromise classified information and used a private server for convenience, and later apologized, saying "I take responsibility."'TRYING TO PIN IT ON ME'
Meanwhile, former Secretary of State Colin Powell over the weekend dismissed reports that Clinton told federal investigators that it was at his suggestion that she used a personal email account, according to a media report.
Powell, who served as the nation's top diplomat from 2001-2005 under Republican president George W. Bush, told People magazine that while he did send Clinton a memo about his own email practices, Clinton had already chosen to use personal email rather than a government account while she had the job."Her people have been trying to pin it on me ... The truth is, she was using (the private email server) for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did," Powell told People on Saturday.  Last week, The New York Times reported that Clinton told federal investigators that Powell had suggested she use personal email for unclassified email when the two spoke over dinner. The conversation occurred "in the early months" of Clinton's tenure at the State Department, the Times said, citing a forthcoming book by journalist Joe Conason that first reported the dinner exchange.Representatives for Powell, in a separate statement to NBC news, said he had no recollection of the conversation with Clinton but did write to her.
"He did write former Secretary Clinton an email memo describing his use of his personal AOL email account for unclassified messages and how it vastly improved communications within the State Department," his office told NBC on Friday.The email exchange occurred in 2009, according to the Times.Powell and aides to his successor as secretary of state in the Bush administration, Condoleezza Rice, received some classified information via personal email accounts, Reuters has reported. Clinton's additional use of a personal computer server at her home, however, broke State Department rules, an internal watchdog found.The FBI last week turned over a number of documents to the U.S. Congress related to its probe into the emails, but this has riled both Democrats and Republicans.Democrats have expressed concern over the potential for politically motivated leaks by Republicans to target Clinton less than three months before the election.Republican U.S. House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz told MSNBC on Monday the documents lawmakers received "are overly redacted" and that they are asking for another version with more of the missing information so they can be made public as soon as possible.(This version of the story corrects paragraph 21 to show Rice aides received emails, instead of Rice) (Writing by Susan Heavey and Ginger Gibson; Editing by Frances Kerry)

WASHINGTON Republican lawmakers called on U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Monday to overhaul proposed regulations intended to crack down on American companies that try to reduce their U.S. taxes by rebasing abroad in a process known as inversion.In separate letters, top Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee warned on Monday that Treasury is moving too quickly to adopt regulations to prevent overseas mergers known as tax inversions, in which U.S. firms relocate their headquarters in countries with lower corporate tax rates."If the proposed regulations are not completely overhauled, they would damage our economy, increase the barriers to investment for American businesses and innovators, and interfere with the growth of ... good-paying jobs," said a letter to Lew from Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady and other Republicans on the panel. 
"We cannot allow this to happen,” they wrote.  The regulations were proposed in April and Treasury has indicated that it intends to move swiftly to finalize the rules. Industry leaders fear the rules could be in place permanently as early as September.One new inversion rule, which has already been imposed on a temporary basis, was challenged this month in federal court by business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Brady and other Republicans including Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch trained their sights on proposals that industry officials say would swamp business with new red tape and cripple internal cash management operations at companies that are not involved in tax inversions."The only prudent way to move forward — given the complexity of the subject matter, given the many significant substantive concerns that have been pointed out, and given the procedural irregularities — is to issue the regulations in re-proposed form," Hatch said in his letter to Lew. 
The proposed debt-equity rule is aimed at stopping a practice known as earnings stripping, which occurs when a newly inverted company eludes U.S. taxes by moving profits overseas as tax-deductible interest payments on loans to its foreign parent.Treasury has proposed requiring debt interest payments to be converted into stock dividends, which are not tax deductible.Critics say the regulations, as proposed, could play havoc with the internal finances of a range of unsuspecting businesses, from multinational corporations to limited partnerships.

NEW YORK Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton leads Republican rival Donald Trump by 8 percentage points among likely voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Friday.The Aug. 14-18 survey showed 42 percent of Americans supported Clinton ahead of the Nov. 8 general election. That compares with 34 percent support for Trump. Another 23 percent of likely voters would not pick either candidate. Clinton has led Trump in the poll throughout most of the 2016 campaign, and has maintained her advantage following last month's Republican and Democratic conventions. Since late July, support for the former secretary of state has ranged between 41 percent and 44 percent of likely voters, while Trump's support has varied between 33 percent and 39 percent.
The race was tighter at this point in the 2012 election, with Democratic President Barack Obama ahead of Republican nominee Mitt Romney by less than 2 percentage points.    Clinton also led a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll that asked people to choose between Clinton, Trump, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and Jill Stein of the Green Party. Some 41 percent supported Clinton and 34 percent supported Trump. Among alternative-party candidates, Johnson came in third with 7 percent and about 2 percent supported Stein. 
Clinton and Trump have both struggled to inspire American voters this year. According to the poll, neither candidate is regarded favorably by most Americans, and two-thirds of U.S. adults believe the country is on the wrong track. Clinton continues to face questions about her handling of classified emails while serving as Obama's secretary of state, while Trump's off-the-cuff remarks about immigrants, women and Muslims have rankled members of his own party.
Republican leaders, including former members of Congress, have called for the Republican National Committee to stop helping Trump and refocus its resources on helping candidates win down-ballot races for the House of Representatives and the Senate. Earlier this week, Trump reshuffled his campaign leadership while his campaign chief, Paul Manafort, faced increased scrutiny over his work with pro-Russian political groups in the Ukraine. Manafort resigned on Friday.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It surveyed samples of 1,119 and 1,118 likely voters, respectively, and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points. (Editing by Jonathan Oatis)



WASHINGTON The FBI and U.S. Justice Department are investigating possible U.S. ties to alleged corruption involving the former president of Ukraine, including the work of firms headed by political operatives Paul Manafort and Tony Podesta, CNN reported on Friday, citing multiple U.S. law enforcement officials.The broad-based investigation was looking into whether U.S. companies and the financial system were used to enable corruption by the party of former pro-Russian Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, CNN said.A person who answered a telephone number for Manafort said Manafort was not available for comment. The person, who said he was an associate of Manafort and who gave his name only as David, referred queries to a lawyer in Washington, who did not immediately respond to a phone call and an email.In response to a report in the New York Times on Monday, Manafort denied any impropriety in a statement. "I have never received a single 'off-the-books cash payment' as falsely 'reported' by The New York Times, nor have I ever done work for the governments of Ukraine or Russia," he said.
The New York Times reported that he had received cash payments worth more than $12 million over five years that were itemized on secret ledgers belonging to Yanukovich's Party of Regions.Manafort, who resigned as chairman of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's campaign on Friday, had not been the focus of the probe, CNN said, citing the officials.The probe was looking at the work of other firms linked to the former Ukrainian government, including the Podesta Group, a lobbying and public relations company headed by Tony Podesta, whose brother John Podesta is chairman of the campaign to elect Democratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
Manafort's attorney Richard Hibey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The FBI declined to comment, CNN reported.
The Podesta Group has hired an independent legal firm to investigate whether it had been misled by the Centre for a Modern Ukraine, a not-for-profit group linked to the ousted Ukrainian government, a spokeswoman for the group said in a statement.The Justice Department, asked to comment on the report, said it remained "committed to helping recover stolen assets on behalf of the people of Ukraine." Investigators in Ukraine have said Yanukovych and his party engaged in widespread corruption. He fled to Russia following a popular uprising in 2014.

WASHINGTON Two senior lawmakers on the U.S. Senate's Judiciary Committee  on Monday pushed for information regarding sharp price increases for EpiPens, drug-filled injectable devices used by people to counter potentially deadly allergic reactions. Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch on Monday to ask how Mylan determined the price of EpiPens and what changes had been made to the product to account for the higher price.The top Democrat on the committee's antitrust subcommittee, Senator Amy Klobuchar, urged the Federal Trade Commission on Monday to investigate the prices, citing news reports showing that the price of a pack of two EpiPens had gone from $100 in 2008 to $500 this year. Mylan acquired the product in 2007."Although the antitrust laws do not prohibit price gouging, regardless of how unseemly it may be, they do prohibit the use of unreasonable restraints of trade to facilitate or protect a price increase," wrote Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who said her daughter relies on an EpiPen.
"The FTC should investigate whether Mylan Pharmaceuticals engaged in activity, such as using incentives or exclusionary contracts with insurers, distributors, or pharmacies, to deny an alternative product access to the market."An EpiPen injects a pre-measured dose of epinephrine (adrenaline) that people use if they are having a dangerous allergic reaction.
The FTC did not say whether an investigation was under way. "The commission takes seriously its obligation to take action where pharmaceutical companies have violated the antitrust laws," a spokesman said.Mylan did not immediately comment on the letters but noted in an email that nearly 80 percent of people with commercial insurance who use a savings card can get the medicine for free.
"With changes in the healthcare insurance landscape, an increasing number of people and families are enrolled in high deductible health plans, and deductible amounts continue to rise. This shift has presented new challenges for consumers, and they are bearing more of the cost," Mylan also said.The FTC opened a probe into Turing Pharmaceuticals for possible antitrust violations in connection with the company's decision to sharply raise the price of a life-saving drug. Turing had raised the price of Daraprim to $750 a tablet from $13.50. (Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editig by Steve Orlofsky)



WASHINGTON Leading Democrats are growing increasingly worried that the hackers who made public leaked documents this week were trying  to sabotage the Democratic candidates in several central Florida congressional races, the first time such leaks have been targeted so directly.Two sources familiar with Democratic Party investigations of  recent cyber attacks said documents made public this week by the hacker known as Guccifer2 contained information that could damage Democratic candidates in competitive Florida contests for the U.S. House of Representatives.
The documents, hacked from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), which raises funds for the party's House candidates, are detailed dossiers describing the Florida candidates' backgrounds, including personal details, as well as political, economic and demographic profiles of the strategic congressional districts.Since 1996, the parties winning the counties in the Interstate 4 corridor between Orlando and Tampa, where several of the targeted districts are located, have won the presidency.
Many of the state's moderate swing voters live in the I-4 corridor, and if Republican voters there turn out in force, it could cut into the vote for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.The DCCC was one of several Democratic Party organizations, including the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, that have been hacked, but the Democratic Party sources said they did not know who might have helped the hackers select the Florida races to target, or what the hackers were trying to accomplish.
There is, though, a growing pattern of attacks on the data systems of U.S. political organizations by hackers whom U.S. intelligence officials and private cyber security firms have concluded are working for or with Russian intelligence agencies. Donald Trump's presidential campaign has hired consultants CrowdStrike to bolster its data security. But two people familiar with attempts to breach the campaign and other Republican organizations said that so far there was no indication of a penetration as serious as those of the Democratic organizations, and CrowdStrike is not investigating any successful hacking of Trump campaign data.

NEW YORK Democratic Party presidential candidate Hillary Clinton does not need to give sworn testimony in a lawsuit brought by a conservative watchdog group over her use of an unauthorized private email system while she was U.S. secretary of state, a judge ruled on Friday.Clinton must instead respond in writing within 30 days to questions submitted by Judicial Watch, a group that has long been critical of her conduct and which is suing the Department of State over Clinton-era records.Judge Emmet Sullivan's ruling in U.S. District Court in Washington is likely to be a relief to Democrats, who did not welcome the prospect of Clinton having to submit to hours of questioning by lawyers in the middle of her campaign for the Nov. 8 election against Republican Party candidate Donald Trump. Clinton, who served as the country's top diplomat from 2009 to 2013, has apologized for her decision to use the unorthodox email set-up, which had the effect of shielding her communications from public-records laws until the arrangement came to light last year.
Voters have said in opinion polls that the email server issue contributes to impressions that Clinton is untrustworthy. The U.S. Department of Justice concluded last month there were no grounds to prosecute Clinton for the arrangement following a year-long investigation.Sullivan has allowed Judicial Watch to obtain sworn testimony in sometimes testy exchanges with several Clinton aides in recent months, saying the court needs to establish whether the server was set up to thwart the Freedom of Information Act. 
But the judge agreed with Clinton's lawyers that former high-ranking government officials can be ordered to give sworn testimony only in "exceptional circumstances."Sullivan also allowed Judicial Watch to get sworn testimony from a former State Department official named John Bentel. According to a scathing report by the State Department's inspector general, Bentel, then a technology official in Clinton's office, told junior staffers to never speak of Clinton's email server again after they raised concerns. Bentel and his lawyer have declined to comment on the episode.
A spokesman for Clinton could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday.Judicial Watch said it was happy with the ruling."We will move quickly to get these answers," Tom Fitton, the group's president, said in a statement. "The decision is a reminder that Hillary Clinton is not above the law." (Reporting by Jonathan Allen, additional reporting by Luciana Lopez; editing by Grant McCool)



Donald Trump's U.S. presidential campaign sealed a major staff reshuffle with the resignation on Friday of its campaign chairman, and the Republican nominee tried to end weeks of upheaval to focus on beating Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.     The departure of Paul Manafort came as Trump tried this week to reset his unorthodox bid for the White House after falling behind Clinton in opinion polls for the Nov. 8 election.Trump said in a statement he had accepted Manafort's     resignation and praised his "great work," but did not offer an explanation for the departure.   Trump aides say the staff changes usher in a greater focus on policy and a more serious tone. The former reality TV host has stuck to that mission, swapping his free-wheeling rally speeches for prepared remarks that stick to a singular theme. He has concentrated on immigration, trade deals and law and order.Speaking in Dimondale, Michigan, on Friday with the use of a teleprompter, Trump stayed clear of much of the hyperbole that has been a hallmark of his campaign.He attacked Clinton for her position on trade agreements, telling the Michigan crowd that the Democrat would send auto jobs to Mexico. Nonetheless, he appeared to stray at times from his prepared remarks, as when he said that black voters, who overwhelmingly tell pollsters they prefer Democratic candidates, should vote for him."You're living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth are unemployed," Trump said. "What the hell do you have to lose?"Trump, who has never held elected office, did not refer to his staffing changes, but in an interview earlier on Friday his son Eric Trump said unflattering headlines about Manafort had taken a toll.
"I think my father didn't want to be, you know, distracted by, you know, whatever things that, you know, Paul was dealing with," he told the Fox News Channel's "Sunday Morning Futures", while also praising Manafort's work for the campaign.Questions have arisen about Manafort's previous work for the political party of the Kremlin-backed former Ukrainian leader, Viktor Yanukovich. Federal investigators from the U.S. Department of Justice are examining American ties to corruption in Ukraine, CNN reported on Friday. The investigation is looking at the work of Manafort's firm and another lobbying firm, the Podesta Group, headed by Tony Podesta, whose brother, John Podesta, is chairman of Clinton's presidential campaign.CLINTON POLL LEAD
Clinton leads Trump by 8 percentage points among likely voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Friday. The Aug. 14-18 online poll showed that Clinton was supported by 42 percent of Americans who are expected to vote, compared with 34 percent for Trump. Some 23 percent would not side with either candidate. On Wednesday, Trump overhauled his campaign team, hiring the head of conservative website Breitbart News, Stephen Bannon, as chief executive of the campaign in a move that bolstered his combative image. Trump also promoted adviser Kellyanne Conway, a data-driven political analyst, to campaign manager.In a previous shake-up, Manafort, who first joined the team in March, took over the running of the campaign from Corey Lewandowski, who was fired as campaign manager in June.    The Clinton campaign has pointed to Manafort's Ukraine work and favorable comments that Trump has made about Russian President Vladimir Putin to sow questions in voters' minds about whether the Russian government has an unseen hand in the U.S. election. Russian officials have rejected that accusation."You can get rid of Manafort, but that doesn't end the odd bromance Trump has with Putin," Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, said in a statement.
'TOO MANY COOKS'
John Feehery, a Republican strategist, said it would have been unsustainable for Manafort to stay on after Wednesday's hires. "Too many cooks in the kitchen," he said.Trump's hiring of Bannon was seen as a sign he would not hold back in his aggressive, unorthodox campaign manner. Still, Trump offered rare words of regret on Thursday for any time he had caused "personal pain" with his take-no-prisoners style. On Friday, he also began airing his first television advertisement since becoming the Republican candidate, buying airtime in the crucial states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Florida, where Clinton has already spent of millions in television advertising. The 30-second ad focuses on immigration, saying Clinton would allow "terrorists and dangerous criminals" into the country, a charge her campaign dismisses.Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute conservative think tank, said Trump still had some time to turn around his campaign, noting the news of the shakeup came as many Americans were enjoying summer vacations. The final stretch of the protracted campaign traditionally starts after Labor Day, which falls on Sept. 5 this year."I'm not sure the public pays a lot of attention to inside campaign stories," she said. "But that said, Trump has clearly been having significant problems in the polls and he needed to do something differently and perhaps this is the beginning of the attempt."Clinton won some relief on Friday from a controversy over her use of a private email system when she was secretary of state. A U.S. federal judge ruled that Clinton did not need to give sworn testimony in a lawsuit about the email issue.

| ISTANBUL

ISTANBUL The boy looked scared and younger than 16 when Iraqi police grabbed him on the street in the northern city of Kirkuk. Pulling off his shirt, they found a two-kilogram bomb strapped to his skinny frame.That was last Sunday. Less than a day earlier, Turkey was less fortunate: a teenage bomber detonated his suicide vest among dancing guests at a Turkish wedding party, officials say, killing 51 people, nearly half of them children themselves.Saturday's attack at the wedding in Gaziantep marked not only Turkey's deadliest this year, but also the first time in Turkey that militants may have deployed a child bomber in a way already used to deadly effect in wars from Africa to Syria. In Afghanistan, the Taliban has long used children. One 14-year-old bomber on a bicycle hit the Kabul NATO base in 2012 killing six people; two years later a teenager blew himself up at French cultural center in the Afghan capital.Researchers and officials say Islamic State and other militants are now increasingly using the same tactics, perhaps to build ranks depleted by losses, preserve adult fighters or simply catch security forces off guard.In West Africa, Boko Haram has preyed on displaced children or young girls it kidnapped to force them to become bombers. In Iraq and Syria, activists say Islamic State took in children from towns it captures or recruited families to its territory, and indoctrinated their children in its schools and camps.Islamic State in particular, highlights its child recruits for its "Cubs of the Caliphate" brigades, publishing images and videos on social media of children receiving training and indoctrination, and carrying out bombings or executions."Child recruitment across the region is increasing," said Juliette Touma, a UNICEF regional spokesperson. "Children are taking a much more active role ..., receiving training on the use of heavy weapons, manning checkpoints on the front lines, being used as snipers and in extreme cases being used as suicide bombers." Little has been publicly released about the attacker in the Gaziantep bombing. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday that the bomber was between 12 to 14 years old, and said Islamic State was probably responsible.
The blast tore into celebrations at a Kurdish wedding on the street late at night. As many as 22 of the dead were under the age of 14. No one claimed the attack, but Islamic State in the past has targeted Kurdish gatherings to stir ethnic tensions.Turkey's prime minister was more cautious on Monday, saying it was too early to say who carried out the attack, though security sources say witnesses reported the bomber was a child.Turkish authorities are also investigating whether militants may have placed the explosives on the suspect, without his or her knowledge before detonating them long distance.That tactic has been used before in Iraq, where children or even mentally disadvantaged adults have been dispatched as unwitting bomb couriers into markets and checkpoints before they are blown up from afar.
TEENAGE RECRUITS
In the failed attack in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk a day later, local television images and photographs showed the boy crying and screaming as he was grabbed by Iraqi security forces near an interior ministry building.Security officials said the boy is 16 years old, though local media reports said he was much younger. He is an Iraqi national from Mosul, the largest urban center still under militant control, which Iraqi and Kurdish Peshmerga forces backed by U.S. air strikes are moving to liberate. Hisham al-Hashimi, an analyst and author who advises the Iraqi government on Islamic State, says militants this year had reactivated their Heaven's Youth Brigade, in reaction to the group's battlefield losses in Iraq and Syria."Teenagers are easier to recruit for suicide missions, especially in moments of suffering or despair having lost loved ones," he said. "They also attract less attention and less suspicion than male adults."
Child recruits who have escaped from Islamic State ranks in its base in Syria's Raqaa have described how they were taught to handle weapons, and also how to detonate suicide belts. A study in February for Combating Terrorism Center at West Point military academy that examined Islamic State propaganda on child and youth 'martyrs' between January 2015 and 2016, found three times as many suicide operations involving children over the year."They represent an effective form of psychological warfare—to project strength, pierce defenses, and strike fear into enemy soldiers' hearts," the study said. "Islamic State is mobilizing children and youth at an alarming rate." Those tactics are mirrored in West Africa where U.N. officials have tracked a rise in attacks like the one carried out by a girl as young as ten who last year exploded a bomb in a busy market place in the Nigerian city of Maiduguri, killing 16 people.Security sources at the time said the explosive device was wrapped around her body.In an April report, UNICEF said attacks involving child suicide bombers between 2014 and this year rose four-fold in northeastern Nigeria, where militant group Boko Haram is based, and neighboring Cameroon, Niger and Chad.A 12-year-old Nigerian girl captured with explosives in Cameroon in March told police she had been abducted by Boko Haram after the group overran her village a year earlier.According to the UNICEF report, nearly two thirds of all the child attackers they tracked were girls. In the first six months of this year alone, UNICEF says it has also noted 38 child suicide bombers in West Africa."This is one of the defining features of this conflict," said Thierry Delvigne-Jean of the agency's west and central Africa office.

WASHINGTON The U.S. Federal Reserve has two guiding goals when designing monetary policy: maximum employment and stable inflation. But as the country's central bankers converge for their annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming this week, they are under increasing pressure to reform their own system and goals to better reflect the diversity of America and its incomes.At this year's flagship economic policy conference, from Aug. 25 to 27, U.S policymakers will confer not only with their counterparts from around the world but also host a meeting on Thursday with a group calling for a radical overhaul of the Fed.Fed Up, a network of community organizations and labor unions that wants a more diverse, transparent and income-inequality aware central bank, will meet with Kansas City Fed President Esther George. It may be one reason why the organizers changed the dress code for the evening, usually a suited and booted affair, to casual attire.So far three other Fed policymakers, New York's William Dudley, Cleveland's Loretta Mester and Boston's Eric Rosengren, are also scheduled to show up.A Fed spokesman said Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard from the Washington-based Board of Governors also plans to attend the meeting.
The activists will look to build on their proposals, put forward in conjunction with former top Fed policy adviser Andrew Levin, to make the Fed's 12 regional banks government entities. The Fed is the world's only major central bank that is not fully public.POWERFUL ALLIES
The group has recently been joined by powerful allies in Congress in forcing racial, gender and income inequality up the Fed's agenda.Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has come out in favor of restricting the financial world's influence on regional Fed boards.
In May, 127 U.S. lawmakers including Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders sent a letter to Fed Chair Janet Yellen urging more diversity among its ranks in order to "reflect and represent the interests of our diverse country."Currently 11 of the 12 regional Fed presidents are white, 10 are male, and none are black or Latino. At the Board level, the highest echelons of the Fed, Yellen is the first woman chair in the central bank's 103-year history.SIGNS OF CHANGE

There are indications that the steady drumbeat of pressure is having some effect on areas on which the Fed does have some control."I believe that diversity is extremely important in all parts of the Federal Reserve," Yellen told Congress in June under sustained scrutiny from lawmakers about the Fed's performance.Minorities now make up 24 percent of regional Fed bank boards, up from 16 percent in 2010, while 46 percent of all directors are either non-white or a woman.Yellen, who has not been shy in speaking on income inequality, has also noted that rising inequality could curb U.S. economic growth.And for a Fed not used to addressing distributional issues associated with monetary policy, such considerations are now seeping into policy discussions."The unemployment rate for African Americans and for Hispanics stayed above the rate for whites..." the Fed noted in minutes released last week from its policy meeting in July.Or as Yellen put it to Congress in June, "We're certainly very focused on...wanting to promote stronger job markets with gains to all groups."

ANKARA/ISTANBUL Turkey vowed on Monday to "completely cleanse" Islamic State militants from its border region after a suicide bomber suspected of links to the group killed 54 people, including 22 children, at a Kurdish wedding.Saturday's attack in the southeastern city of Gaziantep is the deadliest in Turkey this year. President Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday it was carried out by a suicide bomber aged between 12 and 14, adding that initial evidence pointed to Islamic State.    But speaking to reporters in Ankara on Monday Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said it was too early to verify the organization responsible or whether the attack was carried out by a child.  A senior security official told Reuters the device used was the same type as those employed in the July 2015 suicide attack in the border town of Suruc and the October 2015 suicide bombing of a rally of pro-Kurdish activists in Ankara.Both of those attacks were blamed on Islamic State. The group has targeted Kurdish gatherings in an apparent effort to further inflame ethnic tensions strained by a long Kurdish insurgency. The Ankara bombing was the deadliest of its kind in Turkey, killing more than 100 people."Daesh should be completely cleansed from our borders and we are ready to do what it takes for that," Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said at a news conference in Ankara, using an Arabic name for the group.On Monday, Turkey's military launched howitzer attacks on Islamic State while artillery pounded Kurdish YPG militants in Syria, whom Ankara sees as an extension of its own Kurdish insurgency. An official said the strikes were designed to "open a corridor for moderate rebels".  
A senior rebel official said Turkish-backed Syrian rebels were preparing to launch an attack to seize Jarablus from Islamic State, a move that would deny control to advancing Syrian Kurdish fighters.The rebels, groups fighting under the banner of the Free Syrian Army, are expected to attack Jarablus from inside Turkey in the next few days. Reuters TV footage showed around 10 Turkish tanks deployed at a village around 4 km (2.5 miles) from the border gate immediately across from Jarablus. It was not clear how long the tanks had been there.Prime Minister Binali Yilidirm has said Turkey would take a more active role in Syria in the next six months to prevent the country from being divided along ethnic lines. TURKEY TARGET

Cavusoglu said Turkey, a member of NATO and the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, had become the "number one target" for the militants because of its work to stop recruits traveling through Turkey across its over 800 km (500 mile) border into Syria to join the Sunni hardline group. For Ankara, Islamic State is not the only threat across its frontier. Turkey is also concerned that attempts by Syrian Kurds to extend their control along the common border could add momentum to an insurgency by Kurds on its own territory.Dogan news agency said the death toll in the Gaziantep bombing had risen on Monday to 54 after three more people died. Sixty-six were being treated in hospital, 14 in serious condition.The attack comes with Turkey still shaken just a month after the government survived an attempted coup by rogue military officers, which Ankara blames on U.S.-based Islamist preacher Fethullah Gulen. Gulen denies the charge.
Turkish authorities have said a destroyed suicide vest was found at the scene of the bombing.   A second security official told Reuters that they were investigating the possibility militants could have placed the explosives on the child without his or her knowledge and detonated them remotely, or that a child with a learning disability was duped into carrying the device, a tactic seen elsewhere in the region."It could be that someone was loaded with explosives without even being aware of it and it may have been detonated remotely," the official said, adding a search was underway for suspected militants who may have played a reconnaissance role.In the latest southeast violence, two Turkish security force members and five PKK militants were killed in clashes and attacks in three areas of eastern Turkey over the last 24 hours, officials said.Some in Turkey, particularly in the Kurdish southeast, feel the government has not done enough to protect its citizens from Islamic State.The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) said the wedding party was for one of its members. The groom was among those injured, but the bride was not hurt.(This version of the story corrects quotation in seventh paragraph) (Additional reporting by Dasha Afanasieva and Gulsen Solaker in Ankara, Cagan Uslu and Humeyra Pamuk in Istanbul; Writing by David Dolan; Editing by Ralph Boulton and Alison Williams)

| AUSTIN, Texas

AUSTIN, Texas A U.S. judge blocked an Obama administration policy that public schools should allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice, granting a nationwide injunction sought by 13 dissenting states just in time for the new school year.While a setback for transgender advocates, the ruling is only the latest salvo in a larger legal and cultural battle over transgender rights that could be headed toward the U.S. Supreme Court.Following milestone achievements in gay rights including same-sex marriage becoming legal nationwide in 2015, transgender rights have become an increasingly contentious issue in the United States, with advocates saying the law should afford them the same rights extended to racial and religious minorities.U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor of the Northern District of Texas, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, issued a nationwide injunction siding with the 13 states and blocking the Obama administration's bathroom guidelines on Sunday, the evening before students in much of Texas and some of the other affected states were due back in school.O'Connor found the federal government failed to provide states with sufficient notice and opportunity for comment before issuing the guidelines. He also said the guidelines had the effect of law and contradicted existing legislative and regulatory texts.The U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement it was disappointed by the decision and was reviewing its options. Legal experts expected it to appeal, likely asking to put O'Connor's ruling on hold until the case could be litigated.In May, the Justice and Education departments issued guidance that public schools must allow transgender students to use bathrooms, locker rooms and other intimate facilities of their choice rather than those matching their gender assigned at birth. The Justice Department has called the guidelines non-binding, saying they had no legal consequences.
But they were also backed up by a threat to withhold federal education money from states that refused to comply, drawing objections from 13 states, led by Texas, that sued.   Some conservatives have fought an expansion of transgender rights which thy see as an attack on privacy and an example of federal government overreach.In test cases around the country, various lower courts have differed in their interpretation on whether anti-discrimination laws apply to transgender people, potentially sending the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court for a definitive resolution.O'Connor's ruling is "just one small part of an unfolding process," said Aaron Bruhl, a professor at William & Mary Law School in Virginia.
"This won't be the last word on this subject, obviously," he said. "There's a decent chance the U.S. Supreme Court could address this issue in the near future."Katherine Franke, a law professor at Columbia University, said it was "shocking" that O'Connor had applied his injunction to the entire nation, especially since "there's an opposite decision from the 4th Circuit (Court of Appeals) and eight other lawsuits pending."'FEDERAL OVERREACH'
The office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican who frequently sues the Democratic Obama administration, said he was pleased with a decision against "illegal federal overreach."But a group of five civil rights organizations supporting the Obama policy said legal precedent protects transgender students from discrimination, which a single judge cannot overturn."The court's misguided decision targets a small, vulnerable group of young people - transgender elementary and high school students - for potential continued harassment, stigma and abuse," said the five groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal.The judge's decision came about eight hours before Jennifer Campisi took her 9-year-old son E.J., a transgender student, to the first day of school in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. E.J. is not allowed to use the boys' bathroom and instead must use either the nurse's bathroom or a faculty bathroom."These policies just keep kids separate and they put unnecessary stress on parents," she said, adding that allowing transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice is the best solutions for all.Another mother, Alison Kelley, who has two children in the Fort Worth Independent School District, said she opposed the Obama guidelines and that local school authorities should decide what is best case by case."I am not anti-transgender," Kelley said. "I am anti big government getting into my backyard." (Reporting by Jon Herskovitz, Joseph Ax, Lawrence Hurley and Julia Harte; Writing by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Bill Trott and Bill Rigby)



DUBAI The Russian military said on Monday its aircraft operating from an Iranian air base to conduct strikes in Syria had completed their tasks, but left open the possibility of using the Hamadan base again if circumstances warranted.Iran's Foreign Ministry said Russia had stopped using the base for strikes in Syria, bringing an abrupt halt to an unprecedented deployment that was criticized both by the White House and by some Iranian lawmakers."Russian military aircraft that took part in the operation of conducting air strikes from Iran's Hamadan air base on terrorist targets in Syria have successfully completed all  tasks," a Russian Defence Ministry spokesman, Major-General Igor Konashenkov, said in a statement."Further use of the Hamadan air base in the Islamic Republic of Iran by the Russian Aerospace Forces will be carried out on the basis of mutual agreements to fight terrorism and depending on the prevailing circumstances in Syria," Konashenkov said.Last week, long-range Russian Tupolev-22M3 bombers and Sukhoi-34 fighter bombers used Nojeh air base, near the city of Hamadan, in north-west Iran to launch air strikes against armed groups in Syria.It was the first time a foreign power had used an Iranian base since World War Two. Russia and Iran are both providing crucial military support to President Bashar al-Assad against rebels and jihadi fighters in Syria's five-year-old conflict. Some Iranian lawmakers called the move a breach of Iran's constitution which forbids "the establishment of any kind of foreign military base in Iran, even for peaceful purposes".Iranian Defence Minister Hossein Dehghan dismissed that criticism but also chided Moscow for publicizing the move, describing it as showing off and a "betrayal of trust."
"We have not given any military base to the Russians and they are not here to stay," Dehghan was quoted as saying by the Fars news agency late on Sunday.He said there was "no written agreement" between the two countries and the "operational cooperation" was temporary and limited to refueling.The U.S. State Department, which last week called the move "unfortunate but not surprising" and said it was studying if it violated a U.N. Security Council resolution that bars supply, sale and transfer of combat aircraft to Iran, said that it was unclear if Moscow's use of the base had "definitively stopped."ABRUPT END

On Monday, Iran's Foreign Ministry said Russia's use of the base had ended."Russia has no base in Iran and is not stationed here. They did this (operation) and it is finished for now," Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency.Iran's defense minister had said last week that Russia would be permitted to use the Nojeh base "for as long as they need".While noting that Iran has long supported Assad, a U.S. official said Tehran may not have wanted its involvement to be so public ahead of the 2017 Iranian presidential election.
"The Iranians don’t mind helping out quietly. They just don’t want the world to know that they are contributing to the deaths of thousands of Syrian civilians," said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity."It’s their elections ... Everybody gets squeamish around election time," he added.Relations between Iran and Russia, long cordial, appeared to reach a new level last September when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered military intervention in Syria in support of Assad.After some delay, Russia supplied Iran with its S-300 missile air defense system, evidence of a growing partnership that is testing U.S. influence in the Middle East.Dehghan said that to make up for the delay, Russia had suggested providing Iran with its advanced S-400, but that Tehran was not interested as it is working to advance its own home-made defense system.Iran unveiled its new missile defense system, Bavar 373, on Monday, a system designed to intercept cruise missiles, drones, combat aircraft and ballistic missiles.Iran's defense minister also said Tehran has shown interest in buying Russian Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jets and Moscow's reply "has not been negative so far."The United States has said it would use its veto power in the U.N. Security Council to block the possible sales of the fighter jets to Iran.

Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), beating out numerous other bidders, said it agreed to buy U.S. cancer drug company Medivation Inc (MDVN.O) for $14 billion in cash, adding its blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi to the company's growing oncology roster.Medivation shares jumped nearly 20 percent to close at $80.42, just shy of the offer price of $81.50 per share. Shares of Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker, were down 0.4 percent at $34.84. The offer is a 55-percent premium to Sanofi SA's (SASY.PA) initial bid to buy Medivation for $52.50 per share in April, which pushed the San Francisco-based company to put itself up for sale. It represents a 118-percent increase since Reuters reported on March 30 that Medivation had hired JP Morgan to handle interest from companies in a potential acquisition.   The planned purchase of Medivation, with its $2.2 billion-a-year Xtandi, is the latest in a number of deals by large drugmakers willing to pay top dollar for cancer drugs that are more effective than standard, older treatments. Perhaps the most notable example is AbbVie Inc's (ABBV.N) $21 billion purchase last year of Pharmacyclics. The deal gave AbbVie shared ownership with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) in the blockbuster leukemia drug Imbruvica.Analysts predicted the deal would not raise antitrust concerns because Pfizer does not currently sell a prostate cancer drug aside from generics.  Pfizer said its earnings would increase immediately after buying Medivation. The deal comes four months after Pfizer and Ireland-based Allergan Plc (AGN.N) scrapped their $160 billion merger. Pfizer has since bought Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc in a $5.2 billion deal to add an eczema gel to its portfolio.The Medivation deal illustrates a shift in Pfizer's M&A strategy from lowering taxes - the rationale behind the failed Allergan tax inversion deal - to strengthening its lineup of branded drugs, especially lucrative cancer treatments.
Pfizer, in a conference call with analysts, said it still plans to decide by year-end whether to split into separate companies selling either low-growth generics or patent-protected brand medicines. "The Medivation deal increases the likelihood of a split," said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris. But, he said, Pfizer would likely first try to buy other drugmakers or their best assets in order to further strengthen its branded-drug portfolio.A year ago, Pfizer paid $15 billion for Hospira, which sells generic hospital products and is developing biosimilars meant to compete with big-selling injectable biotech drugs. That deal was seen by Wall Street as a way of bolstering its generic drugs ahead of potentially divesting the business. Pfizer's biggest growth driver is a new breast cancer drug called Ibrance. The company is also trying to catch up with Merck & Co (MRK.N) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) in developing immuno-oncology drugs that work by taking the brakes off the immune system to fight cancers.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read told analysts the Medivation deal was mainly driven by the desire to obtain Xtandi, although he expressed high hopes for talazoparib and pidilizumab, experimental Medivation drugs for breast cancer and lymphoma, respectively.
Xtandi generated U.S. net sales of $330.3 million in the second quarter. Japanese drugmaker Astellas Pharma Inc (4503.T) owns the rights to sell Xtandi outside the United States, where it generated sales of $240 million in the period.Read said Xtandi, which was approved four years ago to treat men who had failed to benefit from prostate cancer treatments, could capture far greater sales if it is eventually approved for earlier use and is prescribed by urologists."The product is just at the beginning of its growth cycle," Read predicted. Some analysts, including BMO's Alex Arfaei, said Pfizer appeared to be overpaying for Medivation. But Piper Jaffray analyst Richard Purkiss said the price is not excessive given Xtandi's potential for earlier treatment in coming years.
Reuters had reported that Pfizer, Merck, Celgene Corp (CELG.O) and Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) had submitted expressions of interest to buy Medivation.  "Given the already very high price being discussed, the difficult public relationship between Medivation and Sanofi ...  we see a higher bid as very unlikely, but not impossible," RBC Capital Partners wrote in a client note ahead of the announcement.     Sanofi said while it recognized the potential strategic benefits of a combination with Medivation, it was a "disciplined acquirer and remained committed to acting in the best interests of Sanofi shareholders." Pfizer said the deal was approved by boards of both companies and should be completed in the third or fourth quarter.Shares of other cancer drug companies, including Incyte Corp (INCY.O) and Seattle Genetics (SGEN.O), also rose on Monday, as investors speculated about  more dealmaking in the sector. Pfizer's financial advisers were Guggenheim Securities and Centerview Partners, with Ropes & Gray LLP providing legal counsel. J.P. Morgan Securities and Evercore were Medivation's financial advisers, while Cooley LLP and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz served as its legal advisers.

MANILA The Philippines has recorded about 1,800 drug-related killings since President Rodrigo Duterte took office seven weeks ago and launched a war on narcotics, far higher than previously believed, according to police figures.Philippine National Police Chief Ronald Dela Rosa told a Senate committee on Monday that 712 drug traffickers and users had been killed in police operations since July 1. Police were also investigating 1,067 other drug-related killings, Dela Rosa said, without giving details. On Sunday,  Duterte railed against the United Nations for criticizing the wave of deaths.The United States, a close ally of the Philippines, said it was "deeply concerned" by the reports, and U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner urged Duterte's government to ensure that law-enforcement authorities abided by human rights norms.The drug trafficking crackdown and some strongly worded criticisms Duterte has made of the United States since coming to power present a dilemma for Washington, which has been seeking to forge unity among allies and partners in Asia in the face of an increasingly assertive China, especially in the strategic South China Sea.Toner made the dilemma clear in responses to questions at a regular State Department briefing in Washington, in which he referred to Duterte as "a plain-speaking politician."
"We continue to make clear to the Philippines government ... our concern about human rights, extrajudicial killings, but we are also committed to our bilateral relationship and strengthening that bilateral relationship," he said.Toner said there was no question of the United States turning a blind eye to rights abuses and that the relationship with Manila, while good, was "frank and candid."As recently as Sunday, the number of suspected drug traffickers killed in Duterte's war on drugs had been put at about 900 by Philippine officials. But this number included people who died since Duterte won the May 9 presidential  election.
Duterte said in a strongly worded late-night news conference on Sunday the Philippines might leave the United Nations and invite China and others to form a new global forum, accusing it of failing to fulfill its mandate.His foreign minister, Perfecto Yasay, said on Monday the Philippines would remain a U.N. member and described the president's comments as expressions of "profound disappointment and frustration"."We are committed to the U.N. despite our numerous frustrations and disappointments with the international agency," Yasay told a news conference. U.S. officials declined comment on Duterte's U.N. remarks.Last week, two  U.N. human rights experts urged Manila to stop the extra-judicial executions and killings.
Yasay said Duterte has promised to uphold human rights in the fight against drugs and has ordered the police to investigate and prosecute offenders. He criticized the U.N. rapporteurs for "jumping to an arbitrary conclusion that we have violated human rights of people"."It is highly irresponsible on their part to solely rely on such allegations based on information from unnamed sources without proper substantiation," he said of the United Nations.Senator Leila de Lima, a staunch critic of the president, started a two-day congressional inquiry into the killings on Monday, questioning top police and anti-narcotics officials to explain the "unprecedented" rise in killings."I am disturbed that we have killings left and right as breakfast every morning," she said."My concern does not only revolve around the growing tally of killings reported by the police. What is particularly worrisome is that the campaign against drugs seems to be an excuse for some law enforcers and other elements like vigilantes to commit murder with impunity," De Lima said.

A U.S. national security panel has cleared ChemChina's $43 billion takeover of Swiss pesticides and seeds group Syngenta (SYNN.S), the companies said, boosting chances that the largest foreign acquisition ever by a Chinese company will go through. The decision removes significant uncertainty over the takeover of the world's largest pesticides maker. Several U.S. lawmakers and groups representing farmers had expressed fears over a Chinese state-owned company being in a position to influence the U.S. food supply.Syngenta shares jumped as much as 12.5 percent on the news and ended trading on Monday up 10.6 percent at 421.20 Swiss francs ($437.9). ChemChina's $465 per share cash offer values the company at around 448 Swiss francs per share at current exchange rates, plus a special five-franc dividend."This sends a very good signal to China that the U.S. is open for investments in most sectors. But this also shows the need for a bilateral investment treaty so that similar U.S. investments are possible in China," said Georgetown McDonough School of Business professor Charles Skuba, who studies market development in China. The United States reviewed the deal because more than a quarter of the company's seeds and crop protection revenue last year came from North America. The major regulatory hurdle the deal now has to clear is an antitrust review by the European Union, which the companies may seek to facilitate through divestitures, if need be.
Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Christian Faitz called the step a "major milestone for the deal," adding in a note to clients that "approval removes a major potential hurdle and should come as a relief to Syngenta shareholders." Kepler Cheuvreux rates Syngenta shares a "Buy."    Reuters reported earlier on Monday that the acquisition was in the final stages of being cleared by the U.S. panel that scrutinizes deals for national security implications."We are not disclosing the details of the agreement with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to respect the confidentiality of the process," a Syngenta spokesman said by email in response to a Reuters query. "Any mitigation measures are not material to Syngenta's business."Syngenta reiterated that it expected the deal to close by the end of the year. It added that completing the transaction was subject to "anti-trust review by numerous regulators around the world and other customary closing conditions." 
RIPPLES ACROSS SECTOR
The CFIUS review was monitored closely by Monsanto Co (MON.N), the world's largest seed company, which has been deliberating whether it should sell itself to Germany's Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE). Syngenta last year turned down offers to be acquired by Monsanto.The deal comes as China looks to secure food supplies for its population. Syngenta is a key player in the market for pesticides and seeds. It has facilities in North Carolina, as well a presence in California, Delaware, Iowa and Minnesota among other states.
Several U.S. lawmakers wrote to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew  this year asking for CFIUS to subject the deal to additional scrutiny over its impact on domestic food security. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also joined the CFIUS review, Reuters previously reported."It’s clear that China is looking at purchasing companies with food production expertise as part of a long-term strategic plan and a component of their national security. The fact that a state owned enterprise may have yet another stake in U.S. agriculture is alarming," said U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, who is sponsoring a bill to permanently add the U.S. Department of Agriculture to the CFIUS review process. Syngenta had said this year it would make a voluntary filing with CFIUS "even though no obvious national security concerns were identified during due diligence."With a growing number of Chinese companies looking to acquire U.S. peers, CFIUS has emerged as a significant risk for such deals, particularly those with potential cyber security implications.For example, in February, state-backed Chinese firm Unisplendor Corp (000938.SZ) scrapped a $3.78 billion investment in Western Digital Corp (WDC.O) after CFIUS said it would investigate the transaction.

ISTANBUL The boy looked scared and younger than 16 when Iraqi police grabbed him on the street in the northern city of Kirkuk. Pulling off his shirt, they found a two-kilogram bomb strapped to his skinny frame.That was last Sunday. Less than a day earlier, Turkey was less fortunate: a teenage bomber detonated his suicide vest among dancing guests at a Turkish wedding party, officials say, killing 51 people, nearly half of them children themselves.Saturday's attack at the wedding in Gaziantep marked not only Turkey's deadliest this year, but also the first time in Turkey that militants may have deployed a child bomber in a way already used to deadly effect in wars from Africa to Syria. In Afghanistan, the Taliban has long used children. One 14-year-old bomber on a bicycle hit the Kabul NATO base in 2012 killing six people; two years later a teenager blew himself up at French cultural center in the Afghan capital.Researchers and officials say Islamic State and other militants are now increasingly using the same tactics, perhaps to build ranks depleted by losses, preserve adult fighters or simply catch security forces off guard.In West Africa, Boko Haram has preyed on displaced children or young girls it kidnapped to force them to become bombers. In Iraq and Syria, activists say Islamic State took in children from towns it captures or recruited families to its territory, and indoctrinated their children in its schools and camps.Islamic State in particular, highlights its child recruits for its "Cubs of the Caliphate" brigades, publishing images and videos on social media of children receiving training and indoctrination, and carrying out bombings or executions."Child recruitment across the region is increasing," said Juliette Touma, a UNICEF regional spokesperson. "Children are taking a much more active role ..., receiving training on the use of heavy weapons, manning checkpoints on the front lines, being used as snipers and in extreme cases being used as suicide bombers." Little has been publicly released about the attacker in the Gaziantep bombing. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday that the bomber was between 12 to 14 years old, and said Islamic State was probably responsible.
The blast tore into celebrations at a Kurdish wedding on the street late at night. As many as 22 of the dead were under the age of 14. No one claimed the attack, but Islamic State in the past has targeted Kurdish gatherings to stir ethnic tensions.Turkey's prime minister was more cautious on Monday, saying it was too early to say who carried out the attack, though security sources say witnesses reported the bomber was a child.Turkish authorities are also investigating whether militants may have placed the explosives on the suspect, without his or her knowledge before detonating them long distance.That tactic has been used before in Iraq, where children or even mentally disadvantaged adults have been dispatched as unwitting bomb couriers into markets and checkpoints before they are blown up from afar.
TEENAGE RECRUITS
In the failed attack in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk a day later, local television images and photographs showed the boy crying and screaming as he was grabbed by Iraqi security forces near an interior ministry building.Security officials said the boy is 16 years old, though local media reports said he was much younger. He is an Iraqi national from Mosul, the largest urban center still under militant control, which Iraqi and Kurdish Peshmerga forces backed by U.S. air strikes are moving to liberate. Hisham al-Hashimi, an analyst and author who advises the Iraqi government on Islamic State, says militants this year had reactivated their Heaven's Youth Brigade, in reaction to the group's battlefield losses in Iraq and Syria."Teenagers are easier to recruit for suicide missions, especially in moments of suffering or despair having lost loved ones," he said. "They also attract less attention and less suspicion than male adults."
Child recruits who have escaped from Islamic State ranks in its base in Syria's Raqaa have described how they were taught to handle weapons, and also how to detonate suicide belts. A study in February for Combating Terrorism Center at West Point military academy that examined Islamic State propaganda on child and youth 'martyrs' between January 2015 and 2016, found three times as many suicide operations involving children over the year."They represent an effective form of psychological warfare—to project strength, pierce defenses, and strike fear into enemy soldiers' hearts," the study said. "Islamic State is mobilizing children and youth at an alarming rate." Those tactics are mirrored in West Africa where U.N. officials have tracked a rise in attacks like the one carried out by a girl as young as ten who last year exploded a bomb in a busy market place in the Nigerian city of Maiduguri, killing 16 people.Security sources at the time said the explosive device was wrapped around her body.In an April report, UNICEF said attacks involving child suicide bombers between 2014 and this year rose four-fold in northeastern Nigeria, where militant group Boko Haram is based, and neighboring Cameroon, Niger and Chad.A 12-year-old Nigerian girl captured with explosives in Cameroon in March told police she had been abducted by Boko Haram after the group overran her village a year earlier.According to the UNICEF report, nearly two thirds of all the child attackers they tracked were girls. In the first six months of this year alone, UNICEF says it has also noted 38 child suicide bombers in West Africa."This is one of the defining features of this conflict," said Thierry Delvigne-Jean of the agency's west and central Africa office.

He criticized the U.N. rapporteurs for "jumping to an arbitrary conclusion that we have violated human rights of people"."It is highly irresponsible on their part to solely rely on such allegations based on information from unnamed sources without proper substantiation," he said of the United Nations.Senator Leila de Lima, a staunch critic of the president, started a two-day congressional inquiry into the killings on Monday, questioning top police and anti-narcotics officials to explain the "unprecedented" rise in killings."I am disturbed that we have killings left and right as breakfast every morning," she said."My concern does not only revolve around the growing tally of killings reported by the police. What is particularly worrisome is that the campaign against drugs seems to be an excuse for some law enforcers and other elements like vigilantes to commit murder with impunity," De Lima said.

| ANKARA/ISTANBUL

ANKARA/ISTANBUL Turkey vowed on Monday to "completely cleanse" Islamic State militants from its border region after a suicide bomber suspected of links to the group killed 54 people, including 22 children, at a Kurdish wedding.Saturday's attack in the southeastern city of Gaziantep is the deadliest in Turkey this year. President Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday it was carried out by a suicide bomber aged between 12 and 14, adding that initial evidence pointed to Islamic State.    But speaking to reporters in Ankara on Monday Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said it was too early to verify the organization responsible or whether the attack was carried out by a child.  A senior security official told Reuters the device used was the same type as those employed in the July 2015 suicide attack in the border town of Suruc and the October 2015 suicide bombing of a rally of pro-Kurdish activists in Ankara.Both of those attacks were blamed on Islamic State. The group has targeted Kurdish gatherings in an apparent effort to further inflame ethnic tensions strained by a long Kurdish insurgency. The Ankara bombing was the deadliest of its kind in Turkey, killing more than 100 people."Daesh should be completely cleansed from our borders and we are ready to do what it takes for that," Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said at a news conference in Ankara, using an Arabic name for the group.On Monday, Turkey's military launched howitzer attacks on Islamic State while artillery pounded Kurdish YPG militants in Syria, whom Ankara sees as an extension of its own Kurdish insurgency. An official said the strikes were designed to "open a corridor for moderate rebels".  
A senior rebel official said Turkish-backed Syrian rebels were preparing to launch an attack to seize Jarablus from Islamic State, a move that would deny control to advancing Syrian Kurdish fighters.The rebels, groups fighting under the banner of the Free Syrian Army, are expected to attack Jarablus from inside Turkey in the next few days. Reuters TV footage showed around 10 Turkish tanks deployed at a village around 4 km (2.5 miles) from the border gate immediately across from Jarablus. It was not clear how long the tanks had been there.Prime Minister Binali Yilidirm has said Turkey would take a more active role in Syria in the next six months to prevent the country from being divided along ethnic lines. TURKEY TARGET

Cavusoglu said Turkey, a member of NATO and the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, had become the "number one target" for the militants because of its work to stop recruits traveling through Turkey across its over 800 km (500 mile) border into Syria to join the Sunni hardline group. For Ankara, Islamic State is not the only threat across its frontier. Turkey is also concerned that attempts by Syrian Kurds to extend their control along the common border could add momentum to an insurgency by Kurds on its own territory.Dogan news agency said the death toll in the Gaziantep bombing had risen on Monday to 54 after three more people died. Sixty-six were being treated in hospital, 14 in serious condition.The attack comes with Turkey still shaken just a month after the government survived an attempted coup by rogue military officers, which Ankara blames on U.S.-based Islamist preacher Fethullah Gulen. Gulen denies the charge.
Turkish authorities have said a destroyed suicide vest was found at the scene of the bombing.   A second security official told Reuters that they were investigating the possibility militants could have placed the explosives on the child without his or her knowledge and detonated them remotely, or that a child with a learning disability was duped into carrying the device, a tactic seen elsewhere in the region."It could be that someone was loaded with explosives without even being aware of it and it may have been detonated remotely," the official said, adding a search was underway for suspected militants who may have played a reconnaissance role.In the latest southeast violence, two Turkish security force members and five PKK militants were killed in clashes and attacks in three areas of eastern Turkey over the last 24 hours, officials said.Some in Turkey, particularly in the Kurdish southeast, feel the government has not done enough to protect its citizens from Islamic State.The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) said the wedding party was for one of its members. The groom was among those injured, but the bride was not hurt.(This version of the story corrects quotation in seventh paragraph) (Additional reporting by Dasha Afanasieva and Gulsen Solaker in Ankara, Cagan Uslu and Humeyra Pamuk in Istanbul; Writing by David Dolan; Editing by Ralph Boulton and Alison Williams)

| UNITED NATIONS

UNITED NATIONS The United Nations is ready to deliver aid into Syria's Aleppo, but needs commitments from all parties in the war -  not just Russia - to abide by a 48-hour humanitarian truce, the U.N. aid chief, angered by lack of assistance to civilians, said on Monday.Aleppo, Syria's most populous pre-war city and its commercial hub, has become the focus of fighting in the five-year-old civil war. Up to 2 million people on both sides do not have clean water after infrastructure was damaged in bombing.Russia, which has been backing Syrian government forces with a bombing campaign, said on Thursday it supported the truce. The United Nations wants a weekly two-day halt in fighting to allow access to rebel-held eastern and government-controlled western Aleppo.
"While this (Russian) statement is positive, this cannot be a one-sided offer," the aid chief, Stephen O'Brien, told the U.N. Security Council. "Once we have the green light we can start to move assistance within 48 to 72 hours."United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned last week of an unprecedented "humanitarian catastrophe" in Aleppo and urged Russia and the United States to quickly reach a deal on a ceasefire in the city and elsewhere in the country.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov have been discussing the issue. The United States, which supports some Syrian opposition groups, has been bombing Islamic State militants in Syria.
A crackdown by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on pro-democracy protesters five years ago sparked a civil war, and Islamic State militants have used the chaos to seize territory in Syria and Iraq.O'Brien said no aid had been delivered in August to nearly one million people in besieged and hard-to-reach areas because of fighting and Syrian government bureaucracy.  
"I'm angry, I'm very angry," O'Brien said. "This callous carnage that is Syria has long since moved from cynical to sinful."Syrian U.N. Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari told the council that the Syrian government was not responsible for an air strike in rebel-held al-Qaterji neighborhood last week. A video of a dazed and bloodied Syrian boy - Omran Daqneesh - after he was pulled from the rubble of an air strike in that neighborhood last Wednesday shocked people around the world."The perpetrator must be elsewhere," Ja'afari said.

TRIPOLI Libyan forces renewed their push to oust Islamic State from its former North African stronghold of Sirte on Sunday, saying they had seized the city's main mosque and a jail run by the militants' morality police.The forces, mainly brigades from the city of Misrata, say they are close to capturing Sirte after taking most of the city in a three-month campaign and restricting militants to a shrinking residential area in the city center. Since Aug. 1, they have been supported by U.S. air strikes.At least nine brigade fighters were killed and 85 wounded in Sunday's fighting, Misrata hospital spokesman Akram Gliwan said.Fighters backed by heavy artillery and tanks advanced early in the day in Bufaraa neighborhood, seizing a building used by Islamic State's morality police as a prison, said Rida Issa, a spokesman.
Later, forces took Ribat mosque, Sirte's biggest, where senior militants, including leading Islamic State ideologue Turki Ben Ali, had preached, the forces' media office said.The media office said "dozens" of bodies of Islamic State fighters were found in newly captured areas, although it did not give a specific number and it was not clear when the militants were killed. 
As of Thursday, the United States had carried out 65 air strikes over Sirte, according to U.S. Africa Command, most recently against a supply truck, a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device and three enemy fighting positions.The strikes have accelerated the progress of Libyan forces, whose advance had been slowed by suicide bombings, snipers and mines.
Islamic State took control of Sirte last year, setting up a proto-state modeled on its practices in Iraq and Syria and enforcing its ultra-hardline rule on residents. Losing the city would be a major blow for the group, although militants who escaped or are based elsewhere in Libya are expected to keep trying to exploit the country's political turmoil and security vacuum.

DUBAI The Russian military said on Monday its aircraft operating from an Iranian air base to conduct strikes in Syria had completed their tasks, but left open the possibility of using the Hamadan base again if circumstances warranted.Iran's Foreign Ministry said Russia had stopped using the base for strikes in Syria, bringing an abrupt halt to an unprecedented deployment that was criticized both by the White House and by some Iranian lawmakers."Russian military aircraft that took part in the operation of conducting air strikes from Iran's Hamadan air base on terrorist targets in Syria have successfully completed all  tasks," a Russian Defence Ministry spokesman, Major-General Igor Konashenkov, said in a statement."Further use of the Hamadan air base in the Islamic Republic of Iran by the Russian Aerospace Forces will be carried out on the basis of mutual agreements to fight terrorism and depending on the prevailing circumstances in Syria," Konashenkov said.Last week, long-range Russian Tupolev-22M3 bombers and Sukhoi-34 fighter bombers used Nojeh air base, near the city of Hamadan, in north-west Iran to launch air strikes against armed groups in Syria.It was the first time a foreign power had used an Iranian base since World War Two. Russia and Iran are both providing crucial military support to President Bashar al-Assad against rebels and jihadi fighters in Syria's five-year-old conflict. Some Iranian lawmakers called the move a breach of Iran's constitution which forbids "the establishment of any kind of foreign military base in Iran, even for peaceful purposes".Iranian Defence Minister Hossein Dehghan dismissed that criticism but also chided Moscow for publicizing the move, describing it as showing off and a "betrayal of trust."
"We have not given any military base to the Russians and they are not here to stay," Dehghan was quoted as saying by the Fars news agency late on Sunday.He said there was "no written agreement" between the two countries and the "operational cooperation" was temporary and limited to refueling.The U.S. State Department, which last week called the move "unfortunate but not surprising" and said it was studying if it violated a U.N. Security Council resolution that bars supply, sale and transfer of combat aircraft to Iran, said that it was unclear if Moscow's use of the base had "definitively stopped."ABRUPT END

On Monday, Iran's Foreign Ministry said Russia's use of the base had ended."Russia has no base in Iran and is not stationed here. They did this (operation) and it is finished for now," Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency.Iran's defense minister had said last week that Russia would be permitted to use the Nojeh base "for as long as they need".While noting that Iran has long supported Assad, a U.S. official said Tehran may not have wanted its involvement to be so public ahead of the 2017 Iranian presidential election.
"The Iranians don’t mind helping out quietly. They just don’t want the world to know that they are contributing to the deaths of thousands of Syrian civilians," said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity."It’s their elections ... Everybody gets squeamish around election time," he added.Relations between Iran and Russia, long cordial, appeared to reach a new level last September when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered military intervention in Syria in support of Assad.After some delay, Russia supplied Iran with its S-300 missile air defense system, evidence of a growing partnership that is testing U.S. influence in the Middle East.Dehghan said that to make up for the delay, Russia had suggested providing Iran with its advanced S-400, but that Tehran was not interested as it is working to advance its own home-made defense system.Iran unveiled its new missile defense system, Bavar 373, on Monday, a system designed to intercept cruise missiles, drones, combat aircraft and ballistic missiles.Iran's defense minister also said Tehran has shown interest in buying Russian Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jets and Moscow's reply "has not been negative so far."The United States has said it would use its veto power in the U.N. Security Council to block the possible sales of the fighter jets to Iran.

ISTANBUL/ANKARA Turkish authorities suspended 95 Istanbul police officers, including police chiefs, on Monday, broadcaster CNN Turk reported, the latest steps in a sweeping crackdown to target security forces following a failed coup last month.About 80,000 people in the police, military, judiciary and civil service have been sacked or suspended since the failed July 15 coup, when a group of rogue soldiers attempted to topple the government. Turkey says followers of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen were behind the attempt. Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in rural Pennsylvania since 1999, denies the charge and has condemned the coup. The 95 officers were suspended from duty at Istanbul police headquarters in Istanbul, CNN Turk said. No one was immediately available for comment at the Istanbul police headquarters.
Separately, photos published by state-run Anadolu Agency showed lorries draped with Turkish flags hauling armored vehicles, covered in tarpaulin, out of barracks in Istanbul and Ankara, to be taken to locations outside the cities.Under a decision taken after last month's coup, all military barracks within the two cities are to be moved elsewhere by Sept. 11.
Istanbul and Ankara are to be transferred outside the cities by Sept. 11. Anadolu said armored vehicles from the 66th mechanized infantry brigade were transported out of the Bastabya barracks in Istanbul. It said the transfer of military vehicles would continue.Coup plotters had commandeered vehicles from the Bastabya barracks on the night of the coup, sending them to Istanbul's Ataturk Airport and the police headquarters.
Turkey's Supreme Military Council, which normally meets just twice a year, was to convene for the second time in a month on Tuesday as part of the government's plan to overhaul the armed forces and bring it fully under civilian control.Prime Minister Binali Yildirim was to chair the council meeting, starting at 10 a.m. (0700 GMT) on Tuesday, sources from his office said. No statement has yet been issued on the agenda of Tuesday's meeting. (Reporting by Daren Butler and Ercan Gurses; Editing by David Dolan and Richard Balmforth)

| RIO DE JANEIRO

RIO DE JANEIRO Until now, people in Brazil had something to look forward to. Despite deep recession, a presidential impeachment, and a corruption scandal ensnaring the political and corporate elite, the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro shone on the horizon like a sliver of light from a sunnier era, when Brazil appeared to have its act together.But that was extinguished with the Olympic flame at Sunday's rainy closing ceremony. Now, Latin America's largest country, its dreams shattered, once again finds itself falling far short of its economic and political potential."There is nothing left to disguise the hard reality that we now face," says Roberto Romano, a philosopher, author and commentator on Brazilian society. "This grandiose idea that many believed in until recently has nothing to support it anymore."The idea was that Brazil, after nearly a decade of economic growth that lifted more than 30 million people out of poverty, was finally punching its weight. The Olympics and the 2014 World Cup, which Brazil also hosted, were meant to showcase its arrival on the world stage.Instead, Brazil's economy, and the popular leftist government that presided over its boom years, began to unravel, as if on cue for the big events. The spectacles played out in spite of the economy and politics, not because of them.For sure, the Games had their fair share of hiccups, from green water in the diving pool to a camera that plunged from a broken guide wire, to an international scandal that erupted over an American swimmer's lies about an armed holdup.And questions will linger for years about alleged corruption in contracts for infrastructure and venue construction, not to mention the ultimate price tag for the Games, expected to exceed the already inflated official figure of at least $12 billion.Still, the Olympics unfolded as many Brazilians had expected: the sports went smoothly and the logistical and security problems, allayed by public holidays to reduce traffic and a massive deployment of 85,000 police and soldiers, were not exceptional for a chaotic metropolis of more than 12 million people.
'WHAT NOW?'
With the Games over, Brazilians are asking "what now?""The Olympics were fun, but it was a sideshow," said Flavio Mattos, a 37-year-old fitness instructor from Rio, after watching Brazil lose to Spain in water polo on Saturday. "We now have real problems to fix."Consider the state of the government.
Brazil's Senate this week starts an impeachment trial of President Dilma Rousseff, who was suspended in May because of irregularities in the government budget.Both she and her predecessor Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is credited by most working-class Brazilians with their gains before the boom fizzled, are under investigation for allegedly obstructing justice in a massive corruption scandal centering on the state-run oil company.The economy, once the envy of a developed world wracked by the global financial crisis, is slogging through its worst downturn since the Great Depression. Some indicators suggest a feeble recovery has begun, but others, like a jobless rate that recently climbed past 11 percent, point to continued hard times.Public finances are unsustainable, a hangover from spending increases during the good times when Brazil's devil-may-care approach led it, among other excesses, to secure the rights to host the world's two biggest sports events back to back.The government's budget deficit this year, like last, is expected to equal about 10 percent of economic output, up from about 3 percent in 2013.
"We are looking into an abyss," says Samuel Pessoa, director of the Center for Economic Growth at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a business school and research institute, who calculates that Brazil's economy will have shrunk by as much as 10 percent between 2015 and the end of next year.He and other economists say the government will go broke without reining in spending on salaries, pensions and social security costs."It will be really difficult to attract investment and spur growth when the national treasury is on an explosive trajectory," Pessoa says.Interim President Michel Temer has vowed to tackle those problems, boosting Brazilian stocks and the currency which has rallied recently against the dollar after hitting an all-time low last year.But after backtracking on some reforms, including a bill to limit spending by states, many economists and business people question whether the new government will make much difference.For everyday Brazilians, the uncertainty is troubling."We have to be cautious about everything," says Renato Araujo, a 45-year-old technology consultant and father of two in Rio. "It's hard to plan much for the long term."Without any Olympics or World Cups or other distractions on the horizon, the long term could feel like an eternity."The curtain has come down," says Roberto DaMatta, an anthropologist and prominent columnist for O Globo, a Rio de Janeiro daily. "Reality is going to have to set in." (Editing by Daniel Flynn and Mark Bendeich)

| HASAKA, Syria

HASAKA, Syria The Kurdish YPG militia launched a major assault on Monday to seize the last government-controlled parts of the northeastern Syrian city of Hasaka after calling on pro-government militias to surrender, Kurdish forces and residents said.They said Kurdish forces began the offensive after midnight to take the southern district of East Nashwa, close to where a security compound is located, near the governor's office.The fighting this week in Hasaka, divided into zones of Kurdish and Syrian government control, marks the most violent confrontation between the Kurdish YPG militia and Damascus in more than five years of civil war. It forms part of a broader battle for control of the long border area abutting Turkey.After a morning lull in fighting, fierce clashes broke out again across the city, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The powerful YPG militia has captured almost all of east Ghwairan, the only major Arab neighborhood still in government hands.The YPG is at the heart of a U.S.-led campaign against the Islamic State militant group in Syria and controls swaths of the north, where Kurdish groups associated with the militia have set up their own government since the Syrian war began in 2011.NATO member Turkey, facing a Kurdish insurgency of its own, is concerned about attempts to extend Syrian Kurdish control westward along its border. Turkey is currently allowing a rebel Syrian force under the banner of the Free Syrian Army to assemble on its soil for an attack on an Islamic State-held town, seeking to deny control to the YPG.The Syrian army deployed warplanes against the main armed Kurdish group for the first time during the war last week, prompting a U.S.-led coalition to scramble aircraft to protect American special operations ground forces.
War planes were seen in the skies above Hasaka again on Monday, but did not drop bombs, the Observatory said.  Syrian state media accused the YPG-affiliated security force known as the Asayish of violating a ceasefire and said its members had torched government buildings in Hasaka.It accused the Asayish of igniting the violence through escalating "provocations", including the bombing of army positions in Hasaka, and said the Asayish aimed to take control of the city.
"WE WILL NOT RETREAT"
The YPG denied it had entered into a truce. It distributed leaflets and made loudspeaker calls across the city urging army personnel and pro-government militias to hand over their weapons."To all the elements of the regime and its militias who are besieged in the city, you are targeted by our units," leaflets distributed by the YPG said."This battle is decided and we will not retreat ... We call on you to give up your weapons or count yourselves dead."  The YPG, known as the People's Protection Units and linked to Kurdish rebels who fight the Turkish state, appeared intent on leaving a nominal Syrian government presence confined to within a security zone in the heart of the city, where several key government buildings are located, Kurdish sources said. The complete loss of Hasaka would be a big blow to President Bashar al-Assad's government and would also dent efforts by Moscow, which had sought through a major military intervention last year to help Damascus regain lost territory and prevent new rebel gains.Kurdish forces have expanded their control of the city despite the bombing of several locations by Syrian jets.Thousands of civilians in the ethnically mixed city, including members of the Christian community, have fled to villages in the countryside as the fighting intensified, residents said.The confrontation appears to have undone tacit understandings between the YPG and the Syrian army that had kept the city relatively calm.Hasaka's governor told state media after the flare-up of violence the military had armed the YPG with weapons and tanks to fight jihadist elements but had not expected them to turn against them.Hasaka's population, swelled by displaced Syrians fleeing areas that fell under Islamic State control, is broadly divided along ethnic lines, with Kurds mainly in the city's eastern neighborhoods and Arabs in the southern parts.

DAKAR A detained official from Gambia's main opposition movement died in hospital over the weekend, his United Democratic Party said, its second member to lose their life in custody since the start of a crackdown on protests.Solo Krummah was arrested with 14 others on May 9 during rallies calling for electoral reform, and died on Saturday after an operation at the Edward Francis's Small Teaching Hospital in the capital Banjul, the UDP said.His family had not authorized any operation and there were no details on what the treatment involved or how he died, the party added in a statement.There was no immediate comment from the government or hospital authorities.The U.S. State Department said the United States was "deeply concerned" by Krummah's death and was "troubled" by reports of government mistreatment of detained opposition figures, including allegations of torture.
State Department spokesman Mark Toner called for an "independent investigation of all credible allegations of torture and abuse" and urged Gambia to release all political prisoners and halt its crackdown on opposition politicians.Activists and opposition members have been staging sporadic protests, demanding reforms before December elections - a rare display of defiance against President Yahya Jammeh.
Nearly 50 protesters were arrested in April and May, including UDP party leader Ousainu Darboe and at least 18 other senior members. Eleven opposition supporters were convicted in July, with sentences ranging from fines to three years in prison.Krummah, the UDP's deputy chairman of the Sandu Constituency in eastern Gambia, was detained in Mile 2 prison in Banjul and admitted to hospital on August 8 under armed guard, the UDP said in its statement."The lawyers have been consulted and will act accordingly to get to the cause of the death of Solo and for the body to be given to the party and family for a fitting burial," the UPD added.
The party's national organizing secretary, Solo Sandeng, died in custody in April after being arrested in a similar protest. The UDP says Sandeng was tortured to death - a charge dismissed by the government.Foreign powers and rights groups have regularly accused Jammeh of stamping out dissent. He has ruled the West African nation of 2 million people since taking power in a coup in 1994.

| AUSTIN, Texas

AUSTIN, Texas A U.S. judge blocked an Obama administration policy that public schools should allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice, granting a nationwide injunction sought by 13 dissenting states just in time for the new school year.While a setback for transgender advocates, the ruling is only the latest salvo in a larger legal and cultural battle over transgender rights that could be headed toward the U.S. Supreme Court.Following milestone achievements in gay rights including same-sex marriage becoming legal nationwide in 2015, transgender rights have become an increasingly contentious issue in the United States, with advocates saying the law should afford them the same rights extended to racial and religious minorities.U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor of the Northern District of Texas, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, issued a nationwide injunction siding with the 13 states and blocking the Obama administration's bathroom guidelines on Sunday, the evening before students in much of Texas and some of the other affected states were due back in school.O'Connor found the federal government failed to provide states with sufficient notice and opportunity for comment before issuing the guidelines. He also said the guidelines had the effect of law and contradicted existing legislative and regulatory texts.The U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement it was disappointed by the decision and was reviewing its options. Legal experts expected it to appeal, likely asking to put O'Connor's ruling on hold until the case could be litigated.In May, the Justice and Education departments issued guidance that public schools must allow transgender students to use bathrooms, locker rooms and other intimate facilities of their choice rather than those matching their gender assigned at birth. The Justice Department has called the guidelines non-binding, saying they had no legal consequences.
But they were also backed up by a threat to withhold federal education money from states that refused to comply, drawing objections from 13 states, led by Texas, that sued.   Some conservatives have fought an expansion of transgender rights which thy see as an attack on privacy and an example of federal government overreach.In test cases around the country, various lower courts have differed in their interpretation on whether anti-discrimination laws apply to transgender people, potentially sending the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court for a definitive resolution.O'Connor's ruling is "just one small part of an unfolding process," said Aaron Bruhl, a professor at William & Mary Law School in Virginia.
"This won't be the last word on this subject, obviously," he said. "There's a decent chance the U.S. Supreme Court could address this issue in the near future."Katherine Franke, a law professor at Columbia University, said it was "shocking" that O'Connor had applied his injunction to the entire nation, especially since "there's an opposite decision from the 4th Circuit (Court of Appeals) and eight other lawsuits pending."'FEDERAL OVERREACH'
The office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican who frequently sues the Democratic Obama administration, said he was pleased with a decision against "illegal federal overreach."But a group of five civil rights organizations supporting the Obama policy said legal precedent protects transgender students from discrimination, which a single judge cannot overturn."The court's misguided decision targets a small, vulnerable group of young people - transgender elementary and high school students - for potential continued harassment, stigma and abuse," said the five groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal.The judge's decision came about eight hours before Jennifer Campisi took her 9-year-old son E.J., a transgender student, to the first day of school in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. E.J. is not allowed to use the boys' bathroom and instead must use either the nurse's bathroom or a faculty bathroom."These policies just keep kids separate and they put unnecessary stress on parents," she said, adding that allowing transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice is the best solutions for all.Another mother, Alison Kelley, who has two children in the Fort Worth Independent School District, said she opposed the Obama guidelines and that local school authorities should decide what is best case by case."I am not anti-transgender," Kelley said. "I am anti big government getting into my backyard." (Reporting by Jon Herskovitz, Joseph Ax, Lawrence Hurley and Julia Harte; Writing by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Bill Trott and Bill Rigby)

| BATON ROUGE, La.

BATON ROUGE, La. Quenton Robins watched on Sunday morning as a giant metal claw clamped down on his mother's ruined belongings, snapping wooden cabinets with an audible crack as the operator of a giant mechanized arm slowly cleared a mound of debris from her yard in Baton Rouge.Five feet (1.5 meters) of water swept through the homes in the quiet Park Forest neighborhood just over a week ago, shocking residents who had been told they did not live in a flood zone."It's not a flood zone," said Robins, a 27-year-old Navy veteran. "At least it didn't used to be."As efforts in Louisiana turn from rescue to recovery, renters and homeowners who do not have flood insurance are facing an uncertain financial future.Private insurers do not cover flood damage and flood insurance in the United States is underwritten by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Homeowners who live in designated high-risk flood zones are required to carry flood insurance if they have a federally backed mortgage.
In Louisiana, an estimated 42 percent of homes in high-risk areas have flood insurance, according to FEMA. Only 12.5 percent of homeowners in low and moderate-risk zones do.Many of the areas hit hard by record rainfall last week were not considered at high risk for flooding.Those residents without flood insurance are eligible for up to $33,000 in FEMA individual disaster assistance funds, although most will likely receive less than that, based on payments following other major disasters.After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, FEMA paid $6.6 billion to approximately 1.07 million households and individuals in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, an average of just over $6,000 per grant, according to agency figures. Superstorm Sandy in 2012 produced an average payout of under $8,000 for about 180,000 residents of New York and New Jersey.
FEMA spokesman Rafael Lemaitre said the individual assistance is intended to supplement insurance and to provide short-term relief for immediate needs."It's not designed to make survivors whole again," said Lemaitre, adding that FEMA recommends all homeowners obtain flood insurance regardless of the risk in their area. He also said residents could apply for low-cost loans from the Small Business Administration.FEMA has approved more than $55 million in aid so far and some 106,000 Louisiana residents have registered for emergency assistance after the record floods, which killed at least 13 and damaged more than 60,000 homes.
U.S. President Barack Obama plans to visit Baton Rouge on Tuesday.Down the street from Robins' mother, retired widow Betty Bailey sat in the shade of her carport, waiting for her damaged possessions to be taken away.Bailey, who did not have flood insurance, said she moved to the neighborhood in part because it is not in a flood zone. When she applied for FEMA aid, she said they recommended she look into loans to cover her losses."How do they know I can afford a loan with all the bills I already have?" Bailey said. "That's not right."Looking out at her neighborhood, Bailey added, "Some of these houses will never be built back." (Additional reporting and writing by Joseph Ax)



WASHINGTON A judge ordered the State Department on Monday to review and determine the potential release of 14,900 documents, most of which are believed to be emails to or from Hillary Clinton, that turned up in an FBI investigation of her use of a private email server as secretary of state.    The documents are part of a cache that the FBI turned over to the State Department at the end of its probe into Clinton's use of the server. The Federal Bureau of Investigation found Clinton was "extremely careless" with sensitive information by using the private server but recommended against bringing charges against Clinton. She has been dogged by questions about the issue throughout her run for the White House.    The State Department could make public the first batch of emails in October, weeks before the Democratic nominee faces Republican rival Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 election. State Department employees are due to craft a timeline for the release at a meeting on Sept. 23. The revelation of more emails after 55,000 pages of emails were turned over by Clinton last year could provide continued fodder for opponents who have seized on the email issue to charge she is untrustworthy.The announcement by U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg, who is overseeing a group of lawsuits seeking to make Clinton's emails public, came the same day a conservative watchdog group, Judicial Watch, made public a batch of Clinton's emails obtained through a lawsuit. Judicial Watch says that the emails show donors to the Clinton family's charitable foundation seeking the access to her during the period she was secretary of state from 2009-2013.    The 14,900 documents referred to by Boasberg are believed to include emails that were not included among the 55,000 pages of emails that Clinton previously turned over to the State Department after her use of a private email server and private email account became public last year.
    The new documents are believed to consist chiefly of emails to or from Clinton, said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity, and may include a mix of personal and work emails. Some of the emails were found on the servers of people she or her staff were communicating with.Clinton, who is currently leading Trump in opinion polls ahead of the election, has said she did not compromise classified information and used a private server for convenience, and later apologized, saying "I take responsibility."'TRYING TO PIN IT ON ME'
Meanwhile, former Secretary of State Colin Powell over the weekend dismissed reports that Clinton told federal investigators that it was at his suggestion that she used a personal email account, according to a media report.
Powell, who served as the nation's top diplomat from 2001-2005 under Republican president George W. Bush, told People magazine that while he did send Clinton a memo about his own email practices, Clinton had already chosen to use personal email rather than a government account while she had the job."Her people have been trying to pin it on me ... The truth is, she was using (the private email server) for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did," Powell told People on Saturday.  Last week, The New York Times reported that Clinton told federal investigators that Powell had suggested she use personal email for unclassified email when the two spoke over dinner. The conversation occurred "in the early months" of Clinton's tenure at the State Department, the Times said, citing a forthcoming book by journalist Joe Conason that first reported the dinner exchange.Representatives for Powell, in a separate statement to NBC news, said he had no recollection of the conversation with Clinton but did write to her.
"He did write former Secretary Clinton an email memo describing his use of his personal AOL email account for unclassified messages and how it vastly improved communications within the State Department," his office told NBC on Friday.The email exchange occurred in 2009, according to the Times.Powell and aides to his successor as secretary of state in the Bush administration, Condoleezza Rice, received some classified information via personal email accounts, Reuters has reported. Clinton's additional use of a personal computer server at her home, however, broke State Department rules, an internal watchdog found.The FBI last week turned over a number of documents to the U.S. Congress related to its probe into the emails, but this has riled both Democrats and Republicans.Democrats have expressed concern over the potential for politically motivated leaks by Republicans to target Clinton less than three months before the election.Republican U.S. House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz told MSNBC on Monday the documents lawmakers received "are overly redacted" and that they are asking for another version with more of the missing information so they can be made public as soon as possible.(This version of the story corrects paragraph 21 to show Rice aides received emails, instead of Rice) (Writing by Susan Heavey and Ginger Gibson; Editing by Frances Kerry)



Japan's first lady Akie Abe made an unofficial visit to Pearl Harbor on Sunday where she paid tribute to Americans killed in Japan's surprise attack on the U.S. naval base in Hawaii on Dec. 7, 1941. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Monday the first lady made her visit as a private individual, and it was not an indication that Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would visit Pearl Harbor, the Japan Times reported.A visit by Abe would mark the first time an incumbent Japanese prime minister had gone to the Pearl Harbor memorial.The attack on the naval base by Japanese torpedo planes, bombers and fighter planes drew the United States into World War Two when it declared war on Japan.       In May, Barack Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hiroshima, one of two cities the United States hit with atomic bombs in 1945. The other was Nagasaki.
Since Obama's visit there has been speculation over whether Abe would visit Pearl Harbor. Akie Abe posted photographs on Facebook and wrote that she had gone to the Arizona Memorial offering flowers and prayer. No previous first lady has visited the site while her husband was in office. More than 1,100 sailors and Marines were killed on the USS Arizona in the Japanese attack. The sunken battleship, at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, is the resting place of almost all of them.“I have been to Hawaii many times but I have never been to Pearl Harbor," Japanese publication Gendai Business quoted the first lady as saying. "Over the past year ... I have had many chances to think about (World War Two), and I felt a strong urge to visit at least once in my lifetime," she said. 
Last year marked the 70th anniversary of the end of World War Two.Katina Adams, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department's bureau of East Asian and Pacific affairs, said, "We are aware of First Lady Akie Abe's visit to Pearl Harbor." She declined further comment."The fact that Akie Abe has gone is a tremendous step forward for Japan to come to terms with its past," Shihoko Goto, senior Northeast Asia associate for the Asia program at Woodrow Wilson Center, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said in a telephone interview. "This is certainly a balloon test to see what the public reaction will be."
Japan's embassy in Washington said in an email, "As Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga stated, First Lady Akie Abe visited Pearl Harbor as a personal visit, and we would like to refrain from making further comments on this subject."More than 2,400 U.S. service members were killed in the attack on Pearl Harbor, which President Franklin D. Roosevelt described as a date that would "live in infamy."In April, Prime Minister Abe spoke to the U.S. Congress and expressed "deep repentance" over Japan's role in World War Two. Japan is America's staunchest Asian ally.Japanese Emperor Akihito has expressed remorse over the war."Looking back at the past, together with deep remorse over the war, I pray that this tragedy of war will not be repeated and together with the people, express my deep condolences for those who fell in battle and in the ravages of war, and pray for world peace and the further prosperity of our country," Akihito  said at a memorial service on the 70th anniversary of the day his father, Hirohito, announced Japan's defeat.

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. When Ashley Nurkin's 7-year-old daughter begins second grade in Charlotte, North Carolina, next week, it will be her first time going to school as a girl.She will not be allowed to use the same bathroom as female classmates, leaving Nurkin even more worried about how her daughter will be received as the first transgender student at her public school."The anxiety before my kids go back to school goes up a notch every day," said Nurkin, who has not yet told her daughter she will instead have access to staff restrooms. "I am dreading having that conversation."The emotional roller-coaster for U.S. transgender students going back to school in the next few weeks hit a new curve when a federal judge in Texas ruled late on Sunday that states did not have to follow Obama administration guidance that public schools should allow students to use bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity.The injunction follows the U.S. Supreme Court's decision earlier in August to halt a lower court ruling that would have permitted a transgender student who was born a girl to use the boys' bathroom at his Virginia high school.The rulings come as transgender rights are debated in courts, state legislatures and school districts across the United States, with arguments about bathroom usage eclipsing fights by students seeking to dress according to their gender identity and go by their preferred pronouns.
Parents and advocates of transgender youths say the heated political rhetoric and conflicting interpretations by courts will result in an already vulnerable population entering the new school year under a cloud of confusion and concern.Forcing transgender students to use bathrooms consistent with their sex assigned at birth or single-stall accommodations away from their peers sets them up for isolation, embarrassment and harassment, advocates say."Every student should be able to go back to school being treated equally and consistent with their gender identity," said American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Josh Block, who represents Virginia student Gavin Grimm in the first transgender bathroom rights case to reach the Supreme Court."It's very unfortunate that what happens to them is going to depend on what the courts say is required instead of what administrators know is the right thing to do," Block added.
School districts that have sought to give students access to bathrooms that align with their gender identity faced resistance from some parents and conservative groups.Critics rallied earlier this month against a policy that would have let students attending North Carolina's Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools use bathrooms and changing facilities and participate in extracurricular activities, school photos and dress codes according to their gender identity.Donica Hudson, a mother of three school-aged children, said the rules did not consider the dignity and privacy of all students.
"They want to force the rest of us to be uncomfortable," Hudson said of those pushing for transgender rights. "This is all unnerving."The school district put a temporary hold on the bathroom and changing facilities provision in light of the stay issued by the Supreme Court in the Virginia school case on Aug. 3.The Texas judge's decision has further angered some parents of transgender students, such as Chelsa Morrison.On Monday, she dropped her eight-year-old daughter, Marilyn, off for her first day of third grade at a suburban Dallas school, where district policy requires the transgender child to use a restroom in the library or nurse's office if she does not want to use the boys' bathroom.Morrison pulled Marilyn out of school last spring when the stress of transitioning to living as a girl caused her to have violent stomach problems."They are letting our kids know they are ‘less than,'" she said in a phone interview. "These are not transgender rights. They are human rights for my daughter."

| BELLEFONTE, Pa.

BELLEFONTE, Pa. A lawyer for convicted child molester Jerry Sandusky sought to prove on Monday that prosecutors illegally leaked information to a reporter about the former Penn State football coach and thus tainted the judicial process that resulted in his 2012 conviction.In the second day of a hearing to consider whether Sandusky's first trial was fair, his attorney, Alexander Lindsay, called to the stand Michael Gillum, a psychologist who wrote a book with Aaron Fisher, or "Victim No. 1," one of the young males Sandusky is accused of abusing. Gillum was asked about a passage in the book "Silent No More" in which Sara Ganim, a reporter who wrote a Pulitizer Prize-winning story about Sandusky, showed up at the home of Fisher's mother, even though her son's name was not disclosed at the time.“I believe it is true that Sara Ganim somehow got information about Aaron Fisher after we and Children and Youth Services went to great lengths to protect his identity,” Gillum said, referring to the state agency.
To win Sandusky a new trial, Lindsay must show that the former coach's trial attorney, Joseph Amendola, was incompetent. He believes Amendola should have moved to quash the 2011 indictment because of how he believes Ganim got her information.Lindsay has said in court papers that the Sandusky investigation was failing to find sufficient evidence to prosecute him before Ganim’s story was published in the Harrisburg Patriot-News in late March 2011. The article was pivotal in making the public aware of the allegations against the former Penn State coach, who was indicted that November.Her use of allegedly leaked grand jury information to write the story tainted the grand jury process, Lindsay told the court in Bellefonte, near the Pennsylvania State University's main campus, where Sandusky was an assistant to legendary football coach Joe Paterno for 18 years. 
Judge John Cleland, who has presided in the Sandusky case from the beginning, has ruled that Lindsay must prove state prosecutors or law enforcement officials actually leaked the information to Ganim, not that it could only have been them.Ganim, who is now with CNN, told Reuters in a telephone interview on Monday that, on the advice of her attorneys, she could not make any comment about the case.Lindsay has subpoenaed Ganim to testify but expressed doubt on Monday that she would appear. Under Pennsylvania law, reporters can shield the identity of confidential sources.
Lindsay asked other witnesses, including Corporal Scott Rossman of the Pennsylvania State Police and Anthony Sassano, an agent for the Pennsylvania attorney general’s office, if they knew how Ganim obtained the information. Both denied any knowledge of her source.Sandusky, who is serving a sentence of 30 to 60 years in prison for his conviction, was present in the courtroom on Monday but did not testify.The hearing was to continue on Tuesday with testimony from the three Sandusky prosecutors, including Frank Fina.Fina was at the center of the recent case in which former Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane was convicted of leaking information from a grand jury in a separate case. Prosecutors said Kane illegally leaked the information to embarrass Fina, her political rival, and then lied under oath about it.  (Editing by Frank McGurty and Jonathan Oatis)



Emergency officials confronting a cluster of wildfires with limited resources in eastern Washington state enlisted the help of local farmers to help battle flames that have destroyed about two dozen buildings near Spokane, authorities said on Monday.As of Monday morning, three blazes burning largely unchecked around the outskirts of Spokane, the state's second-largest city, had collectively charred about 13,000 acres (5,260 hectares) of dry brush, grass and timber, with zero percent containment, officials said.The blazes all erupted on Sunday, stoked by extremely hot, dry weather and gusty winds, as authorities scrambled to amass sufficient firefighting forces to meet the sudden threat, recruiting farmers and other volunteers with bulldozers to join the effort.
Cooler temperatures, rising humidity and diminished winds were expected to help crews gain some ground on Monday, as firefighting reinforcements arrived in the area, said Jeff Sevigney, a spokesman for the Washington State Patrol."We're hoping to capitalize on that today," he said.At least 10 homes and numerous outbuildings were leveled on Sunday south of Spokane by the so-called Yale Fire, according to Sevigney.
A separate blaze dubbed the Hart Road Fire gutted 11 to 15 structures, including several homes, on Sunday in the Cayuse Cove community west of Spokane, Lincoln County Sheriff Wade Magers said.He added that an undetermined number of homes and buildings were believed to have been lost in the nearby town of Wellpinit on the Spokane Indian Reservation.
A third, smaller fire just to the northeast of Spokane had died down since Sunday and posed less of a threat, Magers said.Spokane, with a population of more than 200,000 residents, lies about 20 miles (32 km) west of Idaho and about 90 miles (145 km) south of the Canadian border.The Spokesman-Review newspaper in Spokane reported at least two other wildfires have erupted in eastern Washington, one of which has scorched about 22,000 acres (8,900 hectares)  in Franklin County, about 90 miles (145 km) southwest of Spokane.

TORONTO About 1,500 Americans floating down a river that separates the United States from Canada had to be rescued from the water when strong rains and winds sent them illegally into Canadian territory, the country's coast guard said on Monday.The Americans were taking part in the annual Port Huron Float Down on Sunday in the St. Clair River, which runs between the U.S. state of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario.The winds blew the flotilla of inflatable rafts and inner tubes off course and toward the Canadian shore. Some rafts deflated, spurring a rescue effort by the Canadian Coast Guard as well as federal and provincial police, coast guard spokeswoman Carol Launderville said in an email.Most "floaters" had to be rescued from the water, with many towed to shore, according to the coast guard."They were terrified of entering another country without documentation. No one carries their passport or any ID, and a lot were drinking alcohol," Peter Garapick, superintendent of search and rescue for the coast guard, told CBC television. 
Some tried to swim back to the United States."We had to pull a lot of people out of the water and say 'no,'" Garapick said.      
The Americans were gathered at Sarnia, Ontario, and bussed back to the United States by the city's public transit.  Sarnia police did not say whether anyone was charged in the incident and there were only minor injuries reported. Launderville said the event has no official organizer and poses "significant and unusual hazards" due to the river's fast-moving current and participants' lack of life jackets. 
A Facebook page for the event, which dates back more than 30 years in the city of Port Huron, west of the border from Sarnia, made a post Sunday night thanking Canadian authorities."You've shown us true kindness and what it means to be amazing neighbors!" the post read. The Facebook page appears to be operated by a group named Port Huron Float Down, which says on its website it is not an organizer. The page's operators did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Reporting by Ethan Lou in Toronto; Editing by Andrew Hay)

Turkey's Prime Minister Binali Yildirim says authorities do not know if a suicide bomber who attacked a Kurdish wedding killing 54 people was a child.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after Saturday's attack in Gazantiep that the bomber was 12-14 years old.Turkey has linked the bomber to so-called Islamic State (IS), but Mr Yildirim said "a clue has not yet been found concerning the perpetrator".His statement came as Turkey's military targeted IS militants in Syria.Television reports said howitzers had been used against IS near the border town of Jarablus.Turkish artillery had also hit US-backed Syrian Kurdish YPG positions north of Manbij in Syria, broadcaster NTV said.A coalition including YPG has been pushing IS out of Syrian towns, including Manbij, recently.Turkey views the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a Turkish-Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy since the 1980s.'Guess' Speaking to reporters after a cabinet meeting on Monday, Mr Yildirim said the earlier statement identifying the attacker as a child was a "guess" based on witness accounts.Most of the victims were children, media reports say.Twenty-nine victims of the attack, which took place on Sunday, were under the age of 18, reports said, with one official saying 22 were under the age of 14. Thirteen of those killed were women, Turkish media said. Sixty-six people are still in hospital, 14 of them in a serious condition, Dogan news agency reported.One woman lost four children in the attack, the Haberturk newspaper reported. Emine Arhan told the title "if it wasn't for my only surviving child, I would have killed myself".

Another victim was a nine-year-old girl who had stayed on at the party to see the bride after her parents had left, according to the Vatan newspaper.A disproportionately large number of women and children were killed in the attack because it targeted henna night, a part of the celebration attended mainly by women and children, says BBC Monitoring's Turkey analyst Pinar Sevinclidir.

Hurriyet newspaper said the type of bomb, which contained scraps of metal, was similar to those used in previous attacks on pro-Kurdish gatherings.Prosecutors said a search was also under way for two people believed to have accompanied the suspected attacker to the wedding party but who left before the blast.Gaziantep, near the Syrian border, is known to contain several IS cells.In a defiant speech on Monday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said IS should be "completely cleansed" from the border area with Turkey. He also announced that Turkey was recalling its ambassador to Vienna because of a demonstration in the Austrian capital by groups associated with the PKK. Mr Cavusoglu accused Austria of "supporting a terrorist organisation which is attacking Turkey", according to Austrian paper Der Standard.Ties between the two countries have been fraught over the past weeks, with Vienna warning that Turkey is heading towards authoritarian rule, and calling for its membership talks with the European Union to be ended.

Four sponsors have dropped disgraced US Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte, including swimwear manufacturer Speedo and fashion label Ralph Lauren.They were followed by announcements from skin care firm Syneron-Candela and Japanese mattress maker Airweave.It comes after Lochte lied about being robbed at gunpoint by a policeman after a night out during the Rio Olympics.Lochte, a 12-time Olympic gold medalist, has earned millions of dollars through endorsements.Speedo, the biggest sponsor of the four, said: "We cannot condone behaviour that is counter to the values this brand has long stood for."Lochte, aged 32, said he respected Speedo's decision, and thanked the company."I am grateful for the opportunities that our partnership has afforded me over the years,'' he said.Ralph Lauren, which has removed some of Lochte's images from its website, said its sponsorship of the swimmer had been only for the Rio Olympics and would not be renewed. Ralph Lauren and Airweave both stressed that they would continue their support of the US Olympic and Paralympic teams.Syneron-Candela said: "We hold our employees to high standards, and we expect the same of our business partners.''Speedo said it would donate a $50,000 portion of Lochte's sponsorship fee to the charity Save The Children's Brazilian operation.The value of Lochte's Speedo sponsorship has not been disclosed. The contract reportedly expires this year after 10 years.The US business magazine Forbes calculated that in the year of the 2012 London Olympics, Lochte earned about $2m in sponsorships from companies such as Gillette, Nissan, AT&T and Gatorade.Lochte's performance at Rio did not reach the heights of his London triumph, but Forbes estimated his endorsements would still have been between $1m-$2m.DisdainThe saga started when Lochte and three team-mates returned to the Olympic village after a late night out in Rio.They tried, unsuccessfully, to use the locked toilet at a garage and urinated outside instead.After first claiming that he and his three team-mates had been robbed by bogus policemen, Lochte back-tracked and admitted he had, while still drunk, "left details out" and "over-exaggerated some parts of the story".Despite the evidence against him, including CCTV footage, he has however denied that he actually lied in his initial account to Brazilian police.

Lochte's behaviour has been met with disdain in the US and he has been widely pilloried in the US media.On 19 August the New York Post carried a front-page headline describing him as the "Ugly American", along with the slogan "Liar, Liar, Speedo on fire". Lochte is one of the most successful swimmers in history, with 12 Olympic medals, and he once had his own reality television show in the US. In Rio, he swam in two events, winning a gold medal in the 4x200m freestyle relay along with team-mate Jack Conger."We appreciate his many achievements and hope he moves forward and learns from this experience," Speedo said of Lochte.

                    Bottled water in Munich: Terror attacks have fuelled concern about national security
                

For the first time since the Cold War the German government is advising citizens to stockpile food and water for use in a national emergency.Some opposition MPs said the new civil defence concept, to go before ministers on Wednesday, was scaremongering.Citizens are advised to store enough food to last them 10 days, because initially a disaster might put national emergency services beyond reach. Five days' water - two litres (half a gallon) per person daily - is advised.The German news website Frankfurter Allgemeine (FAZ) said the new concept was set out in a 69-page German Interior Ministry document. The document said "an attack on German territory, requiring conventional defence of the nation, is unlikely". But, it said, a major security threat to the nation in future could not be ruled out, so civil defence measures were necessary.Soon, Germans began tweeting ironically under the hashtag "Hamsterkaeufe" (panic-buying).

Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told a group of schoolchildren that Germany must be prepared to react if water or food reserves were poisoned, or if oil and gas supplies were interrupted.  The parliamentary head of the left-wing Die Linke party, Dietmar Bartsch, criticised the move, saying "you can completely unsettle people with yet another round of proposals, such as hoarding supplies".The Greens' deputy parliamentary leader, Konstantin von Notz, said it was sensible to update civil defence advice which had not been touched since 1995.But he warned against mixing up possible military or terrorist scenarios, saying "I can't see any attack scenario that merits a stockpiling of supplies by the population".

                    Mr Trump's hardline immigration policy has been at the centre of his campaign
                

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has signalled he may drop his proposal to deport 11 million people who are living illegally in the US. His campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said the mass deportation plan, which was a central plank of his campaign, was yet "to be determined".Her comments at the weekend came after Mr Trump met with a new panel of Hispanic advisers.He told Fox News on Monday he was not "flip-flopping" but wanted a fair plan."We want to come up with a fair but firm process. Fair but firm," he said, without giving specifics.The businessman was scheduled to deliver a speech on immigration in Colorado on Thursday but his campaign team told US media on Monday afternoon that it has been postponed. Mr Trump has taken a hardline stance on immigration since the beginning of his campaign, vowing to create a "deportation force" as well as make Mexico pay for the construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border. While struggling to keep up with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the polls, Mr Trump has addressed black and Hispanic voters in recent days with the aim of broadening his support beyond white working-class voters. "What he supports is to make sure we enforce the law, that we are respectful of those Americans who are looking for jobs, and that we are fair and humane to those who live among us," Ms Conway told CNN on Sunday. When asked to clarify if Mr Trump would maintain his position on creating a deportation force, Ms Conway responded: "To be determined."A U-turn? Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, WashingtonDonald Trump has repeatedly said the 11.4 million undocumented immigrants in the US "have to go". Now he may be wavering on that demand. The political risks of such a move - detractors will call it a flip-flop - are enormous. It will be difficult for Mr Trump to convince Hispanic voters and moderates that his change of heart is authentic. Meanwhile, Mr Trump's core base of support could feel betrayed.The Republican nominee has survived sometimes contradictory positions - on issues such as gay rights, abortion and the minimum wage - that allow supporters to pick and choose what they think he believes.His position on illegal immigration, however, is different. It's a central part of his argument that the US working class has been grievously wounded by economic policies implemented by a globalist elite more concerned with profit margins than American jobs. A reversal here would be akin to his saying that maybe Nafta isn't so bad after all. It would tear at the heart of his message. Given that Mr Trump's standing with Hispanics - particularly in key battleground states - has been an anchor on his presidential hopes, however, it may be a gamble he's decided to take.But Mr Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, insisted on Monday that the plan remains unchanged."I don't think the message is changing at all. I think people are just getting to know Donald Trump better," Mr Pence said.Mrs Clinton's campaign later released a statement saying there would be little revision to his immigration plan despite Ms Conway's suggestions.

"Donald Trump's immigration plan remains the same as it's always been - tear apart families and deport 16 million people from the United States," said campaign chair John Podesta.If the deportation plan is dropped or refashioned, it would not be the first shift in Mr Trump's immigration policy.His controversial plan to issue a "total and complete shutdown" of Muslims entering the country changed to a ban on countries with a history of terrorism against the US. That switch followed questions raised by constitutional experts.Last week, the Trump campaign faced a dramatic overhaul with the exit of campaign chairman Paul Manafort as well as the hiring of Breitbart News boss Stephen Bannon as CEO and Ms Conway as campaign manager.

                    Supporters of Gina-Lisa Lohfink gathered outside the court at an earlier hearing
                

German model Gina-Lisa Lohfink has been convicted of making false rape allegations against two men in a case that has sparked debate across Germany.She was fined €20,000 (£17,200; $22,600) by a court in Berlin.A video showing Lohfink having sex with the two men in 2012 and saying "No" found its way on to the internet. She insists the incident was rape.But at a subsequent trial the two men were cleared of rape and Lohfink was accused of making false testimony.Lohfink is a former competitor on reality TV show Germany's Next Top Model, and the high-profile case partly informed a recent change to Germany's rape laws.A new law was passed in July clarifying that "no means no" even if the victim did not fight back.

Prosecutor Corinna Goegge said: "Ms Lohfink was not a victim of a sexual offence."She lied and deliberately misled investigators." The court found that the sex was consensual but that Lohfink was saying "No" to it being filmed.But Lohfink has continued to insist that she was raped."I'm not here to become famous," she told the court."I didn't want the sex, nor the filming," she said in her final testimony, according to Tagesspiegel.After the verdict was read out, she cried, "I don't need to put myself through this" before storming out of the courtroom.Lohfink's defence lawyer described the verdict as "a scandal".Burkhard Benecken said he would discuss with her whether she had the strength for an appeal.He was now concerned for all women who wanted to report a rape, he said.One of the two men involved in the case pleaded guilty to a charge related to distributing videos showing the sex act.The case has been extensively covered throughout the German media.Tabloid Bild reported the verdict as "a bitter setback" for Lohfink, and said the verdict was greeted with boos from the public gallery.Die Zeit said that Monday's trial showed "how disrespectfully we treat people, when it comes to the accusation of rape". The case will stigmatise all parties in the long run, the paper said.

                    Hungary has erected a razor-wire fence along stretches of its southern border to keep out migrants
                

A Hungarian member of the European Parliament has been criticised for suggesting pigs' heads could be put on border fences to deter refugees.Gyorgy Schopflin, a member of Hungary's ruling Fidesz party, made the remark after images emerged of vegetables carved into heads and placed along the country's southern frontier."Human images are haram... Pig's head would deter more effectively," he said.Hungary has taken a hard-line stance on migration into the country.Mr Schopflin made the comments responding to criticism from Andrew Stroehlein, European Media Director for the charity Human Rights Watch.



Mr Stroehlein hit back at Mr Schopflin, accusing him of "xenophobic filth" and calling him an "embarrassment to Hungary, to Europe and to humanity".Other Twitter users called the MEP's comments "nasty" and accused him of racism.He has refused to apologise, saying the remark was "hypothetical" and "a thought experiment".  Pork is considered impure by Muslims and its consumption forbidden. Under conservative Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Hungary has taken a tough approach to migrants and refugees entering the country. A razor wire-topped fence now separates stretches of the country's southern border from is neighbours and is patrolled by troops. In October the country will hold a referendum on whether it agrees on the EU's mandatory refugee resettlement policy.

                    Four years after he left the Elysee, Nicolas Sarkozy is keen to return
                

Former French head of state Nicolas Sarkozy has announced that he is a candidate to run again in next year's presidential election.    In order to stand, he must first win his centre-right Republicans party's primary in November.    Mr Sarkozy said he "felt he had the strength to lead the combat at such a tormented moment in our history."  No-one doubts his energy, but a number of obstacles must be overcome if he is to fight his way back to the Elysee.First term legacy

                    Mr Sarkozy's time as president was marked by the 2008 global financial crisis
                

Nicolas Sarkozy served as French president from 2007 to 2012, and the country he left behind as he walked from the Elysee was not a happy one.    The campaign promises of a land where people could "work more to earn more" had vanished. Unemployment was back near 10%; the deficit ballooning; and the much-vaunted "rupture" with the country's uncompetitive past as much a dream as five years previously.Mr Sarkozy could argue - with some justice - that all his plans to rewire the economy had gone down the drain by the 2008 world crisis. But still the man with all the answers turned out to be mainly mouth. Profile: Nicolas SarkozyRival candidates

Nicolas Sarkozy may want to be the centre-right candidate next April, but sadly for him others have the same idea. There are in fact 10 other runners in the November primary, most of whom have no chance whatsoever and are merely putting down markers for the future. A couple are serious rivals.   There is Mr Sarkozy's former Prime Minister Francois Fillon - the man who learned to swallow hard and keep looking impassive through whatever his master's latest putdown.    And then there is Alain Juppe - another former prime minister. Right now Mr Juppe is in fact the favourite to win in the November primary - so Mr Sarkozy has a tough and potentially bitter fight ahead.The law

                    Mr Sarkozy was placed under formal investigation after hours of questioning in February
                

Mr Sarkozy's enemies have always given themselves heart from the thought that if all else fails to bring him down,  justice will.  The list of "affaires" in which the former president is embroiled is long and very complicated. Two stand out.   In the first, Mr Sarkozy is accused of knowingly exceeding campaign funding limits in the 2012 election. In the second, he is said to have put pressure on a judge to reveal details on another case in which he was implicated.In both of these affairs, Mr Sarkozy is "mis en examen" - in other words he is formally the target of a judicial investigation that might well end in a trial.  Were that to happen in the weeks to come, his chances would be scuppered. Luckily for Mr Sarkozy, the wheels of French justice grind exceeding slow.  Still - the law is a weak spot.

Bling is such an annoying, meaningless expression - but Mr Sarkozy undoubtedly suffered from his supposed affinity for a certain kind of lifestyle.    He came to be viscerally loathed by a large part of the population - not just as a political figure, but for the kind of man he was.   In truth, his lifestyle was not that different from other French leaders'. Carla Bruni was no liability: in fact she is quite admired.Far more problematic was Nicolas Sarkozy's odd personality: impulsive, cocky, braggadocio masking some inner insecurity.

If Nicolas Sarkozy ends up against Francois Hollande in 2017 (and it is perfectly possible), it will be an exact re-run of 2012.    Could there be a more crying indictment of French politics? And a more potent argument for Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front?

                    Mahdi said he regretted his actions and asked for forgiveness
                

An Islamist militant has admitted destroying cultural sites in Timbuktu, Mali, in a landmark trial at the International Criminal Court (ICC).Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi said he was "really sorry" for his actions and asked for forgiveness.He was accused of leading rebel forces who destroyed historic shrines at the world heritage site in 2012.It is the first time that the court in The Hague has tried a case of cultural destruction.It is also the first time a suspected Islamist militant has stood trial at the ICC and the first time a suspect has pleaded guilty.Prosecutors said Mahdi was a member of Ansar Dine, an Islamist group that occupied Timbuktu for months. Islamists regard the shrines and the city's ancient manuscripts, covering everything from history to astronomy, as idolatrous.Court documents describe Mahdi as a religious scholar who directed fighters to wreck several sites with pickaxes and chisels after failing to deter locals from praying at them. He was charged with war crimes over the destruction of nine mausoleums and a mosque. Pleading guilty, he said: "I am really sorry, I am really remorseful, and I regret all the damage that my actions have caused."I would like to give a piece of advice to all Muslims in the world, not to get involved in the same acts I got involved in, because they are not going to lead to any good for humanity," he added

Given his guilty plea the trial will probably be over by the end of this week. He faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in jail.Nine victims are later due to share their experiences in court.Human rights groups say their presence is especially significant in demonstrating how the destruction of cultural heritage not only harms buildings but tears through the social, cultural and historical fabric of communities.At the time, Unesco said the attack on the shrines of local saints was "tragic news for us all".Timbuktu is famous for its distinctive mud and wood architecture. It was a centre of Islamic learning between the 13th and 17th centuries and was added to the Unesco world heritage list in 1988.Ansar Dine, an extremist militia with roots in the nomadic Tuareg people, has ties to al-Qaeda. It was eventually driven out of Mali in a French-led intervention.The court has previously heard that Mahdi, a former teacher aged about 40, was a "zealous member" of the militia. He is alleged to have been the head of the section that enforced strict Islamic law in Timbuktu.Treasures of Timbuktu

                    The Democratic Alliance is now in charge of several big South African cities
                

South Africa's governing ANC party has lost control of the country's largest city and economic centre, Johannesburg. The city council elected as mayor Herman Mashaba from the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA). The ANC had run the city since the fall of apartheid more than 20 years ago. It lost its council majority in local elections, although it is still the largest party.The party has also lost control of the capital Pretoria and Cape Town.The end of racial politics?Testing times for South Africa's ANCIt follows local elections earlier this month that produced no outright winner in most districts, resulting in hung municipalities and forcing parties to form coalitions to govern. Of the country's six biggest cities, the ANC only won an outright majority in Durban, seen as a stronghold for South African President Jacob Zuma.



Media captionWhat matters to young South African voters?
 There was drama at Monday's Johannesburg council meeting, which lasted 11 hours. A scuffle broke out between opposition party members and electoral commission officials and an ANC councillor who was sworn in earlier in the day collapsed and died shortly after Mr Mashaba was elected.The ANC had won 44.5% of the vote, more than the DA's 38.4%. But the left-wing Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) with 11% found itself in the position of kingmaker and refused to give its votes to the ANC.Mr Mashaba, a 56-year-old businessman, has promised to reform the city administration. "As of this evening, corruption is declared public enemy number one in this city," he told cheering supporters."Under the DA-led administration, public monies that have been misspent, misused, over the last five, 10 years or so ... we're going to take this money, we're going to look after it, so that we can provide basic services to our people."Mr Mashaba also pledged to tackle unemployment."Over 800,000 of our residents, one-in-three, are today unemployed. We need to address this and we need to address this as a matter of urgency."

                    The "x" symbol is used by in protests against the Ethiopian government attempts to reallocate land
                

A crowd-funding campaign has raised more than $40,000 (£30,000) to help Ethiopia's Olympic marathon silver medallist Feyisa Lilesa seek asylum.He crossed his hands above his head as he finished the race - a gesture made by Ethiopia's Oromo people who have suffered brutal police crackdowns.He says he may be killed if he goes home but Ethiopia's government says he will be welcomed as a hero.However, state media is not showing photos of him crossing the line.There has been a wave of protests in Ethiopia in recent months over a series of frustrations, including attempts by the governments to reallocate land in the Oromo and Amhara regions.US-based Human Rights Watch says security forces have killed more than 400 Oromo protesters, a figure the government disputes.Rule 50 of the Olympic charter bans political displays or protests and the IOC say they are gathering information about the case.More on Ethiopia's unrest:

The BBC's Emmanuel Igunza in neighbouring Kenya says Mr Feyisa is being described by some as the bravest Olympian at the Rio Games for his anti-government protest, but he now faces the prospect of a life in exile.  Within hours of his protest, a crowd-funding page was set up, saying the runner had displayed "extraordinary heroism" and that he had become an "international symbol" for the Oromo protests.The California-based organiser had initially set a target of $10,000 but it was exceeded within an hour."We raised the bar to $25,000 and that too was exceeded in a few hours," Solomon Ungashe wrote on Facebook.

After the race, Mr Feyisa explained why, as an Oromo, he supported the protests about land and resources."The Ethiopian government is killing my people so I stand with all protests anywhere as Oromo is my tribe. My relatives are in prison and if they talk about democratic rights they are killed," he said.A legal team hired by Ethiopians in US is headed to Rio to try and help Mr Feyisa, who has a wife and two children in Ethiopia, with a request to seek asylum in the US. But Information Minister Getachew Reda told the BBC the government had no reason to arrest him and it respected his political opinion.He also said none of Mr Feyisa's relatives had been jailed over the Oromo protests.Ethiopian state-owned television station EBC Channel 3 covered the race live, including the finish, but did not repeat the clip in subsequent bulletins - focussing instead on the winner Kenya's Eliud Kipchoge.

                    Using the Iranian airbase reduced the duration of the Russian bombers' missions
                

Russia has stopped using an Iranian airbase to bomb targets in Syria, both countries have said.Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said the operation was "over for now" and the planes had gone.Iran's Defence Minister Hossein Deghan had earlier criticised Russia for publicising the raids last week, saying it had exhibited a "show-off" attitude.Russia for its part has confirmed that all of its planes used from Iran for Syria strikes are now back in Russia. Russia. like Iran, is a key ally of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad.Last Tuesday, Russia's defence ministry announced that Tupolev-22M3 long-range bombers and Sukhoi-34 strike fighters had used the Shahid Nojeh airbase near the eastern city of Hamedan to carry out air strikes on "terrorists" in Syria.The raids were the first carried by Russia from a third country since it began an air campaign against Mr Assad's opponents almost a year ago, and also the first launched from Iranian soil by a foreign military since World War Two. 



Russia now says that aircraft which were based at the Hamedan air base are no longer located there and have returned to the Russian Federation. Defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that future use of the base will now only take place "on the basis of mutual agreements between the two countries on the fight against terrorism and will depend on developments in Syria".The secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, previously lauded the "strategic" co-operation with Russia. But some MPs complained that it breached the Islamic Republic's constitution, which prohibits allowing foreign militaries to be based on its territory.In an interview with state TV on Monday, Gen Deghan stressed that Russia would only use the Nojeh airbase "for a very short and fixed span, corresponding [to an] operation in Syria".

Gen Deghan was asked why Russia had chosen to reveal its presence there whereas Iran had not. "The Russians are interested to show they are a superpower to guarantee their share in the political future of Syria and, of course, there has been a kind of show-off and ungentlemanly [attitude] in this field."Gen Deghan explained that Russia had "decided to bring in more planes and boost its speed and accuracy in operations".

                    Harambe was shot after a small boy got into his enclosure
                

A zoo in Cincinnati, Ohio, says it is "not amused" by the numerous memes and petitions created after one of its gorillas was shot dead.Staff killed Harambe in May after he grabbed a three-year-old boy who got into his enclosure.Since then he has become a favourite subject of jokers, satirists and campaigners.Responding, Cincinnati Zoo said the constant mentions were making it difficult for staff to move on."Our zoo family is still healing," director Thane Maynard told Associated Press in an email. "We are honouring Harambe by redoubling our gorilla conservation efforts and encouraging others to join us.''Mr Maynard's twitter account was hacked over the weekend. The zoo's accounts have also been flooded with replies.

Harambe's death sparked huge controversy. Debates touched on everything from whether zoo staff were correct to shoot him to why there was so much focus on him amid open conflicts elsewhere in the world. The boy's mother has faced abuse online from those who blamed her for the death of the 17-year-old gorilla. Prosecutors ruled against pressing charges.Cincinnati Zoo reopened its Gorilla World exhibit in June with a higher barrier in an attempt to prevent any more accidents.After his death, numerous petitions have been created in Harambe's honour, some calling for him to be turned into a Pokemon Go character, to be put on a dollar, or carved into Mount Rushmore.A poll in Texas suggested he would get 2% of the popular vote in the US presidential race.Then there are the stream of jokes and references online.

 Selfie-seeking fans of gold medal-winning US gymnast Simone Biles delayed the closing ceremony of the Rio Olympics.Video showed Biles, the US flag bearer in the ceremony, repeatedly being stopped by fellow athletes.The winner of four gold medals was swamped by demands for pictures next to the famous "Biles smile". The ceremony was the culmination of a whirlwind two weeks for the gymnast. And "America's new golden girl" rose to the occasion - wearing a big grin for every picture. She was one of the most successful athletes in the Games, leading the American team to a second consecutive team gold medal by an eye-catching eight points before winning the all-round title and gold medals on vault and floor exercises.

"Simone Biles, in all of her petite, air-defying athleticism, was the ultimate breakout star of the 2016 Olympics," the New York Times Magazine said. "And on Sunday night, during the closing ceremony, it seemed every top athlete from around the world wanted a selfie with her." "Athletes from various countries kept stopping Biles during the ceremony to take the perfect selfie with her." the magazine reported. Such was the demand, it reported, the closing ceremony itself was delayed. The athlete, who stands at 4ft 8in (1.42m), was widely reported to be a little nervous about carrying a flag that was about twice her size. "I'm afraid the flag is going to be too heavy for me," she was quoted as telling reporters ahead of the closing ceremony. "Because Michael Phelps is so much taller and he seemed to carry it so easily and I'm very short so I'm a little worried about that part but I think they'll guide me through it."

More than a thousand Americans accidentally "invaded" international borders after high winds carried their rafts and boats into Canada.The US boaters were part of the Port Huron Float Down, an annual event on the St. Clair River, which divides the US state of Michigan and Canada.Police in Sarnia, Ontario, said it took hours to transport the stranded revellers back to the US on Sunday.No arrests were made and no one was injured, according to police.The unsanctioned event - in which participants float down the river on rafts, inner tubes and other flotation devices - begins at Port Huron's Lighthouse Beach in Michigan and was supposed to end at Chrysler Beach in Marysville.But hundreds of people were not prepared for the strong winds and challenging weather conditions, which blew about 1,500 people out of American waters and over the border. Sarnia Police Service Staff Sgt Scott Clarke told the Times Herald newspaper that participants "were unprepared to be stranded anywhere," adding that many were not equipped with life jackets. "It was a bit of a nightmare, but we got through it," Mr Clarke said. "There were long waits and long lines. They were cold and wet, but they all made it home."

                    The initiative aims to increase elderly Muscovites' social interaction
                

Students learning Russian around the world are being offered the chance to improve their language skills by chatting online to pensioners in Moscow.The new scheme, called Lingualink of Generations, aims to reduce loneliness among elderly people in the Russian capital using video chat service Skype, the Moskva 24 news website reports. "Our pensioners have lived long and interesting lives which they can talk about, and share their wisdom," the project's co-founder Svetlana Pavshintseva tells the site, adding that it will make up for a lack of social interaction in their everyday lives. "Thanks to them, students from other countries will be able to not only master language skills, but also find out more about our culture, history and mindset," she says. Students and graduates from the National Research University Higher School of Economics came up with the idea as part of a competition for socially important projects, and were inspired by a similar initiative in Brazil in 2011.So far, 15 international students have applied online to be paired with an elderly Skype pal, a number organisers hope to double by the end of the year. Tatyana Prusova, from the Older Generation organisation, thinks lots of retirees will be keen to sign up, too. "Many people understand that the old age is not the end of life. They communicate, travel, try to learn something new," she says, adding that some may even want to improve their own foreign language skills.Next story: Thai university creates Pokemon-style parasite appUse #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter.

                    The app invites users to hunt parasites instead of Pokemon
                

A Thai university has created a Pokemon Go-inspired app with an educational aim - to raise awareness about potentially lethal parasitic diseases.The mobile app, called Parasite Hunt, challenges players to seek out various beacons using hints on their smartphones, and then scan a code to reveal a virtual parasite, The Nation website reports. It's been developed for a science fair at Khon Kaen University in north-eastern Thailand, home to a centre for tropical disease research. The app aims to teach youngsters about the dangers of eating raw freshwater fish, a common practice in parts of the region, which raises the risk of contracting the parasitic disease opisthorchiasis and developing bile duct cancer.Once a player has found the virtual parasite, they have to answer questions in order to receive points. "The highest-scoring players will get rewards," says Assistant Prof Dr Nisana Namwat, who leads the university's bile cancer screening and care centre. "Information about the diseases and parasites will be stored on a collection page and can be read at any time," she says.Opisthorchiasis is described as a disease of poor communities, endemic in villages which rely on fishing. The university says there's a general lack of knowledge about the dangers posed by parasites, which can remain in the body for up to 20 years. It says the game is a fun way to engage youngsters, in the hope that they pass on their newly acquired knowledge to others.Next story: China staff fined for not liking boss's Weibo postsUse #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter.

                    Workers said that one colleague had been fined 150 yuan ($23; £17) in a month
                

Employees at a travel company in eastern China have been fined for not commenting on their boss's social media posts, it's reported.More than 200 members of staff at the business in Jinan were slapped with penalties of 50 yuan each ($7.50; £5.70) under the policy, the official Beijing Youth Daily reports. Workers were told to comment on CEO Zhang Ming's Weibo microblogging account, where he posts a mix of company updates and motivational quotes. Those who didn't were "punished accordingly", marketing manager Zhao Ruxin tells the paper, adding that it was done to improve the work ethic of younger staff. One unidentified worker tells the paper they were fined without prior warning. Others say they believe the policy violates labour laws, and that fines were also meted out for things like not carrying bags featuring the corporate logo. But it seems that all publicity is good publicity to Mr Zhang, who wrote a long post saying it's good people now understand the company's corporate culture. He says that while "of course people are not happy to be fined", the business relies on staff to promote it and spur growth.Weibo users aren't impressed, though. Among more than 4,000 comments on the post, one user writes: "I will tell friends and relatives not to use this travel agency in the future, this is terrible." Many accuse him of vanity, and one comment reads: "If you agree with this boss, you have a warped outlook." But one woman concedes that it did get the company noticed. "I admit, what you cooked up wasn't bad, otherwise I wouldn't have known about your travel firm," she says.

At the end of this month 70 years will have passed since the publication of a magazine story hailed as one of the greatest pieces of journalism ever written. Headlined simply Hiroshima, the 30,000-word article by John Hersey had a massive impact, revealing the full horror of nuclear weapons to the post-war generation, as Caroline Raphael describes.I have an original copy of the 31 August 1946 edition of The New Yorker.  It has the most innocuous of covers - a delightful playful carefree drawing of summer in a park. On the back cover, the managers of the New York Giants and the New York Yankees encourage you to "Always Buy Chesterfield" cigarettes.  Past the Goings on About Town and movie listings, past the ritzy adverts for diamonds and fur and cars and cruises you find a simple statement from The Editors explaining that this edition will be devoted entirely to just one article "on the almost complete obliteration of a city by one atomic bomb". They are taking this step, they say, "in the conviction that few of us have yet comprehended the all but incredible destructive power of this weapon, and that everyone might well take time to consider the terrible implications of its use". Seventy years ago no-one talked about stories "going viral", but the publication of John Hersey's article Hiroshima in The New Yorker achieved just that.  It was talked of, commented on, read and listened to by many millions all over the world as they began to understand what really happened not just to the city but to the people of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 and in the following days.

It was spring 1946 when John Hersey, decorated war correspondent and prize-winning novelist, was commissioned by The New Yorker to go to Hiroshima. He expected to write, as others had done, a piece about the state of the shattered city, the buildings, the rebuilding, nine months on. 
Readers who sent letters to The New Yorker wrote of their shame and horror that ordinary people, just like them - secretaries and mothers, doctors and priests - had endured such terror
On the voyage out he fell ill and was given a copy of Thornton Wilders's The Bridge of San Luis Rey. Inspired by Wilder's narrative of the five people who crossed the bridge as it collapsed he decided he would write about people not buildings. And it was that simple decision that marks Hiroshima out from other pieces of the time.  Once in Hiroshima he found survivors of the bomb whose stories he would tell, starting from the minutes before the bomb was dropped. Many years later he told of the horror he felt, how he could only stay a few weeks.  Hersey took these accounts back to New York. Had he filed from Japan the chances of them ever being published would have been remote - previous attempts to get graphic photographs or film or reports out of the country had been halted by the US Occupying Forces. The material had been censored or locked away - sometimes it simply disappeared. John Hersey - 1914-1993

His first novel, A Bell for Adano (1944) - about a Sicilian town occupied by US forces - won a Pulitzer Prize
Hiroshima tops one list of the best 20th Century American journalism
Hersey's editors, Harold Ross and William Shawn, knew they had something quite extraordinary, unique, and the edition was prepared in utter secrecy.  Never before had all the magazine's editorial space been given over to a single story and it has never happened since. Journalists who were expecting to have their stories in that week's edition wondered where their proofs had gone. Twelve hours before publication, copies were sent to all the major US newspapers - a smart move that resulted in editorials urging everyone to read the magazine.
It was read out over four consecutive nights on the new Third Programme, despite some concern among senior managers about the emotional impact on listeners
 All 300,000 copies immediately sold out and the article was reprinted in many other papers and magazines the world over, except where newsprint was rationed. When Albert Einstein attempted to buy 1,000 copies of the magazine to send to fellow scientists he had to contend with facsimiles.  The US Book of the Month Club gave a free special edition to all its subscribers because, in the words of its president, "We find it hard to conceive of anything being written that could be of more important at this moment to the human race."  Within two weeks a second-hand copy of The New Yorker sold for 120 times its cover price.  If Hiroshima demonstrates anything as a piece of journalism it is the enduring power of storytelling. John Hersey combined all his experience as a war correspondent with his skill as a novelist.  It was a radical piece of journalism that gave a vital voice to those who only a year before had been mortal enemies. There in a cataclysmic landscape of living nightmares, of the half-dead, of burnt and seared bodies, of desperate attempts to care for the blasted survivors, of hot winds and a flattened city ravaged by fires we meet Miss Sasaki , the Rev Mr Tanimoto, Mrs Nakamura and her children, the Jesuit Father Kleinsorge and doctors Fujii and Sasaki.      The six characters
Miss Toshiko Sasaki - personnel department clerk aged about 20 who was 1,600 yards from the centre of the blast, her leg is horribly injured
The Rev Mr Kiyoshi Tanimoto - pastor of the Hiroshima Methodist Church, falls ill from radiation sickness
Mrs Hatsuyo Nakamura - the widow of a tailor who died serving in Singapore, with children aged 10 and below
Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge - a German Jesuit priest who feels the strain of being a foreigner in Japan and suffers from exposure to radiation
Doctors Masakazu Fujii and Terufumi Sasaki (not related to Miss Sasaki) - two temperamentally very different medics     
Orientals had been demonised long before Pearl Harbor. The Yellow Peril of the cartoon strips had sunk deep into the American psyche.  In 1941 Time-Life ran an extraordinary article telling readers how they could tell Japanese from Chinese - "How to tell your friends from the Japs".  The pilot of the Enola Gay is reported to have said he felt like sci-fi hero Buck Rogers the day he dropped the bomb. So only a year after the end of the war these six close-ups on five Japanese men and women and one Westerner, each of whom "saw more death than he ever thought he would see" were unexpected and shattering. Readers who sent letters to The New Yorker, almost all in admiration for the work, wrote of their shame and horror that ordinary people, just like them - secretaries and mothers, doctors and priests - had endured such terror. John Hersey was not the first to report from Hiroshima but the reports and newsreels had been a blizzard of numbers too big to fully comprehend. They had reported on the destruction of the city, the mushroom cloud, the shadows of the dead on the walls and streets but never got close to those who lived through those end-of-days time, as Hersey did. It was also becoming increasingly clear to some that this new weapon carried on killing long after the "noiseless flash" as bright as the sun, despite intense government and military attempts to cover it up or deny it.

Hiroshima was the first publication to make the man on the San Francisco trolleybus and the woman on the Clapham omnibus confront the miseries of radiation sickness, to understand that you could survive the bomb and still die from its after effects. John Hersey in his calm unflinching prose reported what those who had survived had witnessed.  As the nuclear arms race began, just three months after the testing of further atom bombs at Bikini Atoll, the true power of the new weapons began to be understood.  Such were the reverberations of Hersey's article, and Albert Einstein's very public support for it, that Henry Stimson who had been US Secretary for War wrote a magazine article in reply, The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb - a defiant justification for the use of the bomb, whatever the consequences.  News of the extraordinary article had been reported in Britain, but it was too long to publish - John Hersey would not allow it to be edited and newsprint was still rationed.  So the BBC followed American radio's lead and about six weeks later it was read out over four consecutive nights on the new Third Programme, despite some concern among senior managers about the emotional impact on listeners. The Radio Times commissioned Alistair Cooke to write a long background piece. Alluding to its publication in The New Yorker, renowned as the home of witty cartoons, he called it "the deadliest joke of our age".Find out more

The listening figures were high and the BBC decided to rebroadcast the reading on the Light Programme all in one go, just a few weeks later, to make sure even more people heard it. That's the Light Programme whose remit was, according to the BBC Handbook for that year, "to entertain its listeners and to interest them in the world at large without failing to be entertaining".  There was little to entertain in this two-hour programme.  The Daily Express critic, Nicholas Hallam, called it the most terrifying broadcast he had ever heard. 
Hersey never forgot his survivors - in 1985, on the 40th anniversary of the bomb, he went back to Japan
The BBC had also invited John Hersey to be interviewed and his cabled reply is in the BBC archives: "Hersey gratefullest invitation and BBC interest and coverage Hiroshima but has throughout maintained policy let story speak for itself without additional words from himself or anybody." Indeed, Hersey was only to give three or four interviews his entire life. Sadly not one of them was for the BBC.   A 1948 recording of a reading of Hiroshima remains in the BBC archives. The effect of the crisp English voices telling this harrowing story is startling. The prose is revealed as rhythmic and often quietly poetic and ironic.  One of the readers is the young actress Sheila Sim, newly married at the time to the actor Richard Attenborough.By November, Hiroshima was published in book form. It was translated quickly into many languages and a braille edition was released. However, in Japan, Gen Douglas MacArthur - the supreme commander of occupying forces, who effectively governed Japan until 1948 - had strictly prohibited dissemination of any reports on the consequences of the bombings. Copies of the book, and the relevant edition of The New Yorker, were banned until 1949, when Hiroshima was finally translated into Japanese by the Rev Mr Tanimoto, one of Hersey's six survivors.Hersey never forgot his survivors. In 1985, on the 40th anniversary of the bomb, he went back to Japan and wrote The Aftermath, the story of what had happened to them in the intervening four decades.  Two of them had since died, one of them certainly from radiation-related disease.   More from the Magazine

                    Montreux on Lake Geneva: Affluent Switzerland has long been a magnet for foreign workers
                

British politicians are now poring over ways to extricate Britain from the EU, following June's vote to leave. One of the key problems they hope to solve is how to protect UK access to Europe's markets, while controlling immigration from the EU.Many in Britain wonder if non-EU member Switzerland could show the way. Switzerland has access to Europe's single market, its economy is booming, unemployment is low. The country, at first sight, thrives outside the EU.But first appearances can be deceptive. In one very crucial area, immigration, the Swiss find themselves in a very tricky position.It is all to do with a landmark referendum held in February 2014, when the Swiss voted - very narrowly - in favour of quotas on immigration from the EU.That sounds a perfectly reasonable thing to do: Switzerland is not in the EU and should, it might be assumed, be able to control its borders, and the numbers of people arriving to work.But it is not that simple. Over more than a decade the Swiss, whose economy depends on trade with Europe, have negotiated a series of bilateral, but interdependent, agreements with Brussels. EU red lineAccess to the EU's single market hinges on Switzerland's participation in free movement of people. And so, two-and-a-half years after the vote for quotas, nothing has changed. Free movement is still in place in Switzerland.

Despite ever more desperate efforts by Swiss diplomats to negotiate a deal with the EU that would honour voters' wishes, the silence from Brussels has been deafening."The EU has one red line, and that is quotas," explained Cenni Najy of the Swiss political think-tank Foraus."They will never accept quotas, because that would mean really the end of free movement."Brexit complicationsAnd Mr Najy believes Britain's vote to leave the EU will make Switzerland's situation even more difficult."I think Switzerland will have to wait many months, maybe even many years," he said. "Now the number one preoccupation of the European Commission is to find a settlement for the UK, and not to allow Switzerland to free ride or to have very specific tailor-made agreements."But Switzerland cannot afford the delay. The government is in a race against time to prepare legislation to limit EU immigration, before a March 2017 deadline demanded under the Swiss constitution.Swiss-EU ties
Switzerland voted against joining the European Economic Area (first step to EU membership) in 1992
It has negotiated more than 100 bilateral treaties with Brussels
24.3% of the total population of 8.2 million is not Swiss
Largest group of non-Swiss nationals are Italians, closely followed by Germans, then Portuguese
Immigration from EU countries has been among highest in Europe, but has decreased since 2014 because of market forces
Will the Swiss limit EU immigration?Switzerland country profile Five models for post-Brexit UK tradeSquaring a circleThe conundrum is: how to introduce the quotas that voters say they want, while preserving that crucial access to Europe's single market.Last month, Switzerland's President Johann Schneider-Ammann met the European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, on the sidelines of the Asia-Europe Summit in Mongolia.Swiss diplomats were privately relieved the meeting involved a quick coffee and not just a handshake in a corridor, but it did not yield the deal the Swiss had hoped for.Later Mr Schneider-Ammann, in an interview with Swiss television, bluntly highlighted the problem."We've got to find a way to keep free movement of people, and to respect the will of the voters to reduce immigration... we're trying to square a circle."

Swiss business leaders, increasingly uncertain about how long they will be able to recruit from Europe, or how long their access to the single market will last, are worried."It doesn't help investors in Switzerland as long as this big question is not settled with the European Union," pointed out Jan Atteslander of the Swiss Business Federation.Safeguard optionThe federation has been working on compromise proposals: not exactly quotas, but a mechanism under which employers would be required to give preference to workers already living in Switzerland, if, in certain professions, unemployment was high."It's a safeguard clause," Mr Atteslander explained. "That in some areas, where you see too high immigration, you can slow it down temporarily, and then after a quarter or half a year you can look again."It is believed the UK government may also be looking at such options.







The problem, many analysts believe, is that a deal designed to please everyone, both Brussels and Swiss voters, may actually please no one. It is unlikely that Mr Atteslander's modest temporary suggestion - which, given Switzerland's strong economy and need for skilled workers, is unlikely even to be triggered in the foreseeable future - will please the powerful right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP). It campaigned hard for proper quotas on immigration, and its leaders insist that the will of Swiss voters must be honoured in full.Meanwhile from Brussels' point of view, a safeguard clause which appears to discriminate against EU citizens in favour of the Swiss could still be viewed as a violation of free movement.Vote again?And so another solution is emerging, which may sound rather familiar to Brexit Britain.Among young Swiss, a majority of whom voted against immigration quotas, there is a movement to hold the vote all over again. The necessary 100,000 signatures have been gathered, and campaigner Sean Serafin believes a new vote will be more informed than the last one."When voting on quotas the Swiss had a system they knew well, which was freedom of movement, and a theoretical system, quotas, which was not very clear," he explained. "So I think they decided to vote for some sort of control over immigration, without knowing what it meant."Mr Serafin is confident that, now that voters know how hard it is to "square the circle" with Brussels, they may change their minds, and back free movement of people.

Lessons for Britain?But a new referendum cannot be held before that March deadline, and the Swiss now hope a visit to Zurich, planned for September by Jean-Claude Juncker, might bring a deal. Political analyst Cenni Najy is sceptical. "Within the internal market there are four freedoms, and you cannot disassociate them," he says. "If you want access to the internal market, you have to accept free movement of persons. They [the EU] have said it to Switzerland and I think they are going to say it also to the UK."Some of Britain's most Eurosceptic politicians have suggested leaving the single market would be a survivable move. But UK business leaders, like the Swiss, are becoming anxious.So while Britain agonises over its EU exit strategy, in Switzerland the waiting game continues. Perhaps that deafening EU silence over Swiss attempts to change free movement is directed not just at the little alpine country, but at the big island nation across the Channel too. 


 
Between them, Michael Phelps, Usain Bolt and Simone Biles won 12 gold medals in RioThe flame went out on the 2016 Olympics in Rio on Sunday, bringing to an end 16 remarkable days of sporting action.More than 10,000 athletes, representing 207 nations, competed in 31 sports in Brazil, with 306 sets of medals awarded over the course of the Games.Records were broken, history was made, legends confirmed and superstars born.BBC Sport looks at the key stats to emerge from the event:USA retain top spot
For the second successive Games, and the 17th time overall, the United States topped the medal table with 43 golds.The nation's overall medal total of 116 is their highest since 1984, when they claimed 174 on home turf in Los Angeles.The US were dominant in athletics, winning 31 medals (13 of which were gold) - 20 more than second-placed Jamaica, who won six golds.The nation also ruled in the pool, winning 33 of the 104 medals awarded, which is 32%. Of these medals, 16 were gold. Their nearest rivals, Australia, won 10 swimming medals (three gold).The USA's Rio tally helped them achieve two notable historical milestones as they passed 1,000 golds and 2,500 Olympic medals overall. They have extended their sizable lead at the top of the all-time Olympic medal table.
On the board...
US trio top the medal chartsThe USA also dominated the podium for multiple-medal winning athletes as Michael Phelps once again shone and fellow swimmer Katie Ledecky and gymnast Simone Biles enhanced their global reputation.In his fifth Games, Phelps took his personal medal tally to 28 (23 golds, three silvers and two bronzes) courtesy of another stunning display in the pool.Ledecky, 19, followed up her solitary gold in London in 2012 with four more, along with a silver, as she dominated the women's freestyle events.In her Olympic debut, 19-year-old Biles added to her remarkable international medal haul with four golds and a bronze.
Lightning Bolt strikes againIn his final Games, Jamaica's Usain Bolt confirmed his status as the greatest sprinter of all time, winning three more golds to achieve an unprecedented Olympic 'triple triple' in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay.Bolt's haul of nine golds is the joint highest among Olympic athletics, putting him equal with USA sprinter and long jumper Carl Lewis and Finnish long-distance runner Paavo Nurmi.
Some notable milestones
Records fall27 new world records were set in Rio within the seven Olympic sports that recognise them - archery, athletics, modern pentathlon, track cycling, shooting, swimming and weightlifting.American Ledecky claimed two of those, in the women's 400m and 800m freestyle.The women's team pursuit cycling record was broken three times during the course of the event in Rio by Great Britain Katie Archibald, Elinor Barker, Joanna Rowsell-Shand and Laura Trott.In athletics, Michael Johnson's 17-year-old men's 400m record was broken by South Africa's Wayde van Niekirk, while Ethiopia's Almaz Ayana smashed the women's 10,000m record, clocking 29 minutes, 17.45 seconds to take 14 seconds off Wang Junxia's 1993 time.Gold medallist Anita Wlodarczyk broke her own world record in the women's hammer, setting a new distance of 82.29m - the sixth time the Pole has set a new record in the event.A global games

Five hundred and thirty-seven votes in Florida.In an election with more than 100 million ballots cast, that's all it took to make George W Bush president in 2000. So while the US presidential election is often described as an exercise in appealing to as many voters as possible, candidates will never neglect a niche audience. Here are five groups - both large and small - that could tip the scales in 2016.White men without university degrees

Polling has shown that these are the core voters for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. His positions on trade and immigration have resonated with working-class voters. But the question is - Are there enough of them, especially in battleground states, to carry him to victory? Don Levy, who conducts polls in New York state, says Mr Trump would have to win these voters at a "tremendously high margin".  Mr Trump's supporters are optimistic that can happen and often pose these two complementary theories: 
Many of these voters have stayed home in previous elections and will turn out for Mr Trump
Some of Mr Trump's voters aren't open with pollsters about their support because the candidate is not "politically correct"
Mr Levy, the director of the Siena College Research Institute, says he isn't buying either scenario. In his polling, he says that voters have not been reluctant to voice their support for Mr Trump, often keeping pollsters on the phone for long periods explaining why they support the billionaire businessman. And in a race with such unpopular candidates, he expects lower turnout - not a wave of new voters. Perhaps, most importantly, Mr Levy notes that to get Mr Trump to the White House, he will not need just those men - he will also need their wives."There is a lot of talk about the 'Angry White Man' vote," Mr Levy says. "Trump certainly appeals to that group. But many of those angry white men are married to people. He needs to carry 'Mrs Angry White Man' too." Unfortunately for Mr Trump, his favourability numbers among women are dismal, especially among highly-educated women.Where they count: So-called "Rust Belt" states such as Ohio and PennsylvaniaWhite women with university degrees

                    A recent poll showed that 57% of university-educated white women supported Mrs Clinton
                

A traditionally Republican constituency, university-educated white women are moving firmly into the Democratic coalition. Focus groups have found that highly-educated women have been put off by some of Mr Trump's provocative statements. A Pew Research study found that voters were particularly repelled by an incident where Mr Trump mocked a disabled journalist and another where he implied that Fox News presenter Megyn Kelly was menstruating because she asked a tough question at a debate. This has helped turn two battleground states - Virginia and Colorado - into likely wins for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Both states have high levels of educational attainment - 43% of Colorado residents have a university degree, while 44% of Virginia residents are university graduates.Mr Trump has alienated women pretty effectively, says Virginia pollster Harry Wilson of Roanoke College. "And once people are turned against you, it's difficult to get them back."Where they count: Virginia and Colorado Anti-Trump Republicans

                    Mr Trump's support has eroded in recent weeks
                

In mid-July, Mr Trump was enjoying a slim lead in the polls, signalling that the New York billionaire could pull off a narrow win in November with a united Republican coalition. But by August, after a series of inflammatory statements, Mr Trump's popularity had cratered. Frank Luntz, a news analyst for Fox News and CBS who specialises in polling and focus groups, is in search of the voters Mr Trump lost.  He says it is a broad group, but it skews younger and more female. He believes the former supporters were attracted to Mr Trump's message that the "system is broken" and an outsider is needed to fix Washington. "But now they see Trump as mean-spirited, unkind and just hateful," Mr Luntz said.There is time to win them back, but the veteran political analyst is doubtful Mr Trump will use the time wisely. He says the Republican nominee lacks focus to stay on a message of change, which appeals to these disaffected supporters."The more fed up you are with the system the more likely you are to vote for Donald Trump, no matter where you are on the political spectrum," Mr Luntz said.Where they count: Florida, Ohio and NevadaPuerto Ricans

In recent years, Puerto Rico has seen an economic downturn that has sent residents of the US territory to the mainland in search of better opportunities.

Mike Binder, a political science professor at University of North Florida, says more than half of new voters registered in the state since 2012 are Latino, many of them Puerto Rican.Long dominated by its Cuban community, Florida's Latinos have typically supported Republican candidates. However in 2016, the rising Puerto Rican population - combined with Mr Trump's immigration policies, which some see as anti-Latino - could change that. These new voters may not be the largest voting bloc, but in Florida a small edge could deliver a win. Polls show an extremely tight race between Mrs Clinton and Mr Trump. President Obama won the state by only 74,000 votes in 2012. Where they count: Florida Mormons

                    The Mormon Church has been a vocal critic of Mr Trump's Muslim ban
                

While some Christian groups have either tolerated or embraced the brash persona of Mr Trump, Mormons - typically dutiful Republicans - have soundly rejected the New York billionaire. Once a persecuted religious minority, many Mormons were deeply unsettled by Mr Trump's plan to temporarily ban Muslims from travelling to the US. Polls have shown that Utah - which hasn't voted for a Democrat since the 1960s - is suddenly not a sure bet for Republicans in 2016. Two third-party candidates, Independent Evan McMullin and Libertarian Gary Johnson, are also based in Salt Lake City. Their appeal to Mormons further complicates Mr Trump's efforts to eke out a victory in Utah. Mormons, along with a rising Latino population, could also sway the vote in neighbouring Arizona. Polls there show a tight race, with Mrs Clinton leading in some surveys.Where they count: Utah and Arizona


 The Rio 2016 Olympics have provided an abundance of memorable moments. Here are some of the best - good, bad, and ugly.
One of the first Olympic moments to go viral happened when Pita Taufatofua, Tonga's flag-bearer, appeared at the opening ceremony. The taekwondo athlete emerged topless, wearing traditional Tongan dress and apparently covered in baby oil. It did not go unnoticed.Opening ceremony had warmth, passion and hopeAthlete outfits from the opening ceremony
One photograph quickly demonstrated that the Olympic games caters for all shapes and sizes. This photo of US gymnast Ragan Smith and basketball player DeAndre Jordan swept across the internet as soon as she posted it online.
Another Olympic highlight captured on social media. Lee Eun-ju of South Korea and Hong Un-jong of North Korea provided a moment of unity as the two gymnasts - from countries technically still at war with each other - posed for a smiling selfie.North Korean athlete selfie: What happens next?
It wasn't always so friendly in the swimming pool. Twitter went into meltdown after swimming legend Michael Phelps was pictured giving rival Chad le Clos a "death stare". He was caught putting his game face on while in the warm-up area of the Olympic pool, prompting #Phelpsface to trend on Twitter.  
The first golden moment for the host nation - the story of Brazil's 57kg judo champion Rafaela Silva shone a light on some of Rio's poorest residents. From one of Rio's toughest neighbourhoods, the so-called City of God, Silva was disqualified at London 2012 and later labelled an embarrassment. Her victory marked a fairytale rise.Brazil's first gold from the City of God favela
It wasn't long before Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time, broke into a smile, beating le Clos of South Africa in the men's 200m butterfly final. Some suggested le Clos should have been looking where he was swimming rather than watching his rival.
It was not all about the winners in the pool. Rami Anis - a swimmer for the refugee team who fled war-torn Syria in 2015 before travelling by boat across the Mediterranean Sea to Turkey - earned a standing ovation after setting a personal best in the men's 100m freestyle.
It wasn't just the swimmers attracting all the attention. Some bored-looking lifeguards - who had been charged with watching over the best swimmers in the world - caught the attention of many people on social media.
A memorable moment for a small nation. Fiji's rugby sevens players burst into song as they celebrated winning their country's first-ever Olympic medal - a gold - after beating Great Britain 43-7 in the final.
Nineteen-year-old US gymnast Simone Biles took the Games by storm, producing a stunning performance to win the women's all-around Olympic gold medal. She ended up taking home four gold medals and a bronze. She was even watched by Buzz Aldrin, a man who has walked on the moon.Why Simone Biles is the best at the Games
The colour of the water at the Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre became a major talking point, after it turned from aquatic blue to a murky green overnight. Games organisers blamed chemical levels in the water.
Pictures of Egypt's women's beach volleyball team swept the internet, after Doaa Elghobashy took part while wearing a hijab.Does this picture show a culture clash?
American swimmer Katie Ledecky dominated in the pool, taking nearly two seconds off her own world record to win the women's 800m freestyle final in eight minutes 4.79 seconds - finishing nearly 12 seconds clear of the rest of the field. She also won the women's 200m freestyle, the 400m freestyle and the 4x200m freestyle relay.
The first world record inside the Olympic Stadium went to Ethiopia's Almaz Ayana, who smashed the previous record by more than 14 seconds to win gold in the women's 10,000m.
Egyptian Islam El Shehaby caused controversy when he refused to shake the hand of Israeli opponent Os Sasson after losing in the men's judo. El Shehaby was roundly booed by the crowd and was later sent home from Rio, the International Olympic Committee said.
Singapore's gold medallist Joseph Schooling, who idolised Michael Phelps as a child, managed to get the better of his hero in pool, winning the 100m butterfly ahead of Phelps, Chad Le Clos and Laszlo Cseh - who finished joint second. A photograph of a young Schooling, then just 13, with Phelps at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 quickly went viral.
One of the images from the track cycling came when Laurine van Riessen, of the Netherlands, managed to avoid a nasty crash with France's Virginie Cueff by riding up and along the barrier at the side of the track. Such was the extent of her precautionary action, she became almost horizontal.
Some athletes were disappointed to miss out on gold, or with having to settle with a mere silver or bronze medal. Not Aurimas Didzbalis of Lithuania. The weightlifter celebrated pocketing a medal in the men's 94kg with an impressive back flip.
A nation gasped when he tripped and fell, but despite taking a mid-race tumble, Britain's Mo Farah became the first British track and field athlete to win three Olympic gold medals as he retained his 10,000m title with a thrilling victory.
It wasn't all tears on the podiums. Britain's Sir Bradley Wiggins instead poked out his tongue to celebrate winning the men's cycling team pursuit - his fifth Olympic gold medal. He also became the first Briton to win eight Olympic medals.Wiggins and other podium moments 
Chinese diver He Zi had just collected her silver medal in the 3m women's springboard final when fellow diver Qin Kai entered the podium presentation. He duly got down on one knee, produced an engagement ring and proposed. She said yes.
Never far from the spotlight, Jamaica sprinter Usain Bolt managed to find time to smile for the cameras while easing to a 100m semi-final victory. It prompted a flurry of internet memes. He later won the final in a time of 9.81 seconds - his third 100m crown in three Olympic Games. 
How do you upstage Mr Bolt? Why not break a world record less than half an hour before the great man was due to run in the 100m final? South Africa's Wayde van Niekerk shattered Olympic legend Michael Johnson's 17-year-old 400m world record by 0.15 seconds to sensationally win Olympic gold. Apparently the credit goes to his 74-year-old great-grandmother - who happens to be his trainer. Old master, new hero: How Bolt was nearly upstaged
How can you forget a dancing weightlifter? Big David Katoatau, from Kiribati, threw some shapes every time he successfully made a lift. He finished sixth in the men's 105kg Group B final but certainly kept the crowds entertained.
Shaunae Miller of the Bahamas somehow managed to win a dramatic gold medal in the women's 400m final - by diving over the line. Miller stumbled in the final stages and then lunged forward as she headed towards the track, edging out American world champion Allyson Felix to win in 49.44 seconds.
Ireland's bantamweight Michael Conlan went out of the boxing tournament in the quarter-finals - losing on points to Vladimir Nikitin of Russia. Conlan was furious at the verdict, which was booed by the crowd, and he vented his frustration at the judges afterwards, saying he had been "robbed" of his dream of winning Olympic gold.
A golden night for Britain's golden couple. Laura Trott first won gold in the women's omnium - following up her victory in the women's team pursuit. She then had to sit trackside as fiance Jason Kenny won his third gold of the games and his sixth in total in a dramatic keirin - which twice had to be restarted. One relationship, 10 Olympic gold medals. Not bad.Laura Trott & Jason Kenny - Britain's golden coupleCycling's Posh and Becks: Golden couple 'just Laura and Jason'
There were tears on the podium for France's Renaud Lavillenie, but for all the wrong reasons. The pole vault silver medallist was booed by the Rio crowd for a second time in 24 hours, having lost out to home favourite Thiago Braz da Silva in a dramatic final.
One of the most bizarre stories from Rio involved American gold medal-winning swimmers and a petrol station. Ryan Lochte, Jimmy Feigen and Jack Conger became embroiled in an international scandal over a made-up robbery. It became an Olympic mystery and resulted in a police investigation and a series of apologies.US falls out of love with the ultimate 'bro'Ryan Lochte, Prince Harry and the 'grill'
Was it fratricide? Was it brotherly love? It definitely ended well for the Brownlee brothers, Alistair and Jonny, who won gold and silver in the men's triathlon. The image of the British brothers collapsing into each other arms at the finish line will live long in Yorkshire memories.The inside story of the Brownlees' triumph
Unperturbed Bolt, once again, shows his gregarious personality by pointing in admiration at Canada's Andre De Grasse as both men cross the line - in first and second place respectively - in the men's 200m semi-final. Bolt went on to win the final, of course.
Morolake Akinosun ploughed a lonely furrow down the home straight after the USA women's 4x100m relay team was allowed to re-run their heat after dropping the baton. They successfully argued they had been obstructed in their first race and ran on an empty track to qualify for the final. All the extra effort was worth it as the USA went on to win the final in 41.01 seconds - the second-fastest time in history. 
Nick Skelton became Britain's second-oldest Olympic gold medallist when he won the individual show jumping event. The 58-year-old, who had retired in 2000 after breaking his neck in two places, triumphed after a six-way jump-off. The only person older than Skelton to win gold for Britain was shooter Joshua Milner in 1908 - aged 61. Skelton will not beat that record as he has ruled out competing in the Tokyo Games in four years' time.
The true Olympic spirit shone out when New Zealand's Nikki Hamblin (left) and Abbey D"Agostino of the USA helped each other out after colliding in their heat of the women's 5000m. D'Agostino tore her anterior cruciate knee ligament in the incident but both runners insisted on completing their race. They were both handed places in the final but the injury prevented the American taking part.
The triple triple? The treble treble? However you dress it up, Usain Bolt has nine Olympic medals from three Olympic Games. He said victory in the 100m, the 200m and the 4x100m relay would make him "immortal". It is hard to argue.Bolt's amazing Olympic career in numbers
Brazil exorcised the demons of their 7-1 defeat by Germany in the World Cup semi-final in Belo Horizonte in 2014 by beating them in a penalty shoot-out to win the Olympic gold medal. The match had finished 1-1 after extra-time and star striker Neymar, who missed the World Cup humiliation because of injury, scored during normal time before converting the decisive penalty and bursting into floods of tears.
Britain's Mo Farah completed the double double as he became only the second man, after Finland's Lasse Viren, to retain both the 5,000m and 10,000m Olympic titles. His four gold medals make him his country's most successful track and field athlete.
After the competition, came the party as Rio produced a carnival-style closing ceremony full of music, dancing and colour.

The Olympic flame was extinguished with artificial rain - on a night where there had been plenty of actual rain.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe appeared dressed as computer game character Super Mario, with the next Olympics being held in Tokyo in 2020.

                    Alberta's oil sands have long been a a target of climate change campaigners
                

A debate is raging in Alberta over plans to get more "dirty oil" out of the ground, which some say is in conflict with Canada's environmental commitments. BBC HARDtalk went to investigate.When Hanna Fridhed welcomed us into her home in Fort McMurray last month, there was no door to walk through and no windows to look out of, just the charred remains of a house obliterated by fire.The culprit? The Beast - the name given to the massive wildfire that swept through northern Alberta in Canada in May, destroying parts of Fort McMurray and forcing the evacuation of its roughly 90,000 residents. For many environmentalists, the wildfire was not simply a natural disaster but partly the result of man-made climate change, a point brought uncomfortably close to home by Fort McMurray's proximity to Alberta's vast oil sands deposits. The oil sands, sometimes referred to as "dirty oil", have long been a target of climate change campaigners who insist that the energy-intensive extraction of oil sands and the greenhouse gas emissions it generates, mean most of the remaining deposits must stay in the ground.

But that is highly unlikely especially with an estimated 160 billion barrels lying beneath Alberta's soil.Instead, Alberta's provincial government is introducing an economy-wide carbon tax from next year and a cap on greenhouse gas emissions. That, along with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's signing of the Paris Climate Agreement in April, is seen as real progress by some Canadians.  Or is it? At the moment, oil sands operations emit roughly 70 megatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions each year but the cap will be set at 100 megatonnes. Alberta's Minister of Environment Shannon Phillips defended the higher cap: "The CO2 is what matters here and Alberta is the first and only energy-producing jurisdiction to say, 'Look yes you may develop, but you must do so responsibly under an emissions cap this far and no further'.

                    Shannon Phillips says 20% of Canadian GDP relies on Alberta's oil and gas industry
                

"The fact of the matter is that in the short to medium term, 20% of Canadian GDP relies on Alberta's oil and gas industry. That's not small."With all due respect to environmental groups outside of this province, our prime responsibility is to the people of Alberta and we've just gone through a massive drop in oil prices, tens of thousands of people out of work."So do environmental groups such as Greenpeace need to get real? Is it economically viable, let alone plausible, for Canada to turn its back on such a lucrative resource?Greenpeace activist Mike Hudema said Alberta's initiatives were "good initial steps", but added: "When you look at tar sands or oil sands development, there's no way you can continue to expand, to add 30 megatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere and still meet what we said we were going to meet in Paris."Most of the oil sands are found under forests populated by bears, moose and other native wildlife. And within a stone's throw from this natural splendour is the Christina Lake oil sands operation, south of Fort McMurray.

                    Christina Lake produces about 160,000 barrels of oil a day
                

It is run by Cenovus Energy, whose executive vice-president of oil sands manufacturing, Drew Zieglgansberger, guided us on a full day's tour, a sort of smorgasbord of the various processes used to bring the oil to the surface. Drills burrow down to the oil sands, which can be 500m below the surface, then steam is pumped in to liquefy the oil before it is pumped to the surface. No open pit mining, no huge scars on the landscape and no lakes of toxic waste. But the process is very energy intensive."I think the challenge is really not oil production it's the carbon emissions associated with oil," Mr Zieglgansberger told us. "One of the big things we've been able to unlock here using technology is actually enabling this resource to be part of the energy mix. In the last 10 years alone we've dropped the emissions intensity of these barrels by over 33%."Christina Lake produces about 160,000 barrels of oil a day and Cenovus has plans for further expansion. Mr Zieglgansberger acknowledged climate change is "one of the most important challenges of our time," but insists the oil is necessary. "lt is going to be needed in any energy mix in any consensus, any report that's been published. If we look out [across] the next decades, oil is still going to be needed." HARDtalk on the Road in Canada is presented by Stephen Sackur and produced by Tama Muru. You can see the programme on Monday 22 August on BBC World News and the BBC News Channel and after on BBCiPlayer (UK only).







The Olympics really were no match.There was only one show in town, sorry, in the nation on Saturday night.Canada's national broadcaster CBC broke from Rio to air the whole of The Tragically Hip's final gig live. They advertised it as "A National Celebration", and they weren't wrong.Only about 7,000 fans had actually managed to cram into the K-Rock Centre in Kingston, Ontario.Kingston - the home town of Gordon Edgar "Gord" Downie, whose announcement in May that he had terminal brain cancer had caused shock across the nation.

It's perhaps hard for those outside Canada to understand just how big the band are there. They are known as the most Canadian band in the world. They are simply a part of the national identity.Look at the picture of Kingston's Springer Market square on Saturday night and it starts to make sense.Nine number one albums in Canada, 14 Juno awards (Canada's tribute to its musicians) and this final 15-concert Man Machine Poem tour to say farewell. Kingston had declared Saturday The Tragically Hip Day.#Canadaisclosed was the mantra, as was "Hip Night in Canada" and, of course, #InGordWeTrust.











At how many concerts will the audience rise from their seats to sing a spontaneous version of the national anthem before the band start?And the concert itself? A three-hour set spanning some three decades of music-making and cramming in crowd favourites such as Nautical Disaster, New Orleans is Sinking, Bobcaygeon and the final hurrah of Ahead by a Century.A denim jacket-clad Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was there. Gord was not about to miss the opportunity to get his message across, urging the PM to address the historical mistreatment of indigenous people.But he also said Mr Trudeau was "going to take us where we need to go".

The fans also hung on every word of Gord, who provided his traditional cultural and social commentary.In the end he kept it simple. After an "unchartered" third encore, it was an emotional and brief "thank you for that".Arm in arm, Downie, Rob Baker, Paul Langlois, Gord Sinclair and Johnny Fay walked off for the last time.One concert-goer, probably speaking for many, said the band had provided a "soundtrack of our lives".And CBC eventually went back to the Olympics... but even then it managed to post a montage video of athletes battling away to the sound of The Hip's track Three Pistols.

A confidential review of the government's plan for a seven-day NHS has identified 13 risks, according to the Guardian and Channel 4 News.These include concerns over a shortage of doctors and other health staff.The leaked risk register was drawn up by the Department of Health, and sets out a series of possible problems.The Department of Health said the government was tackling an "unacceptable variation" in standards in care across the week.The government has promised a "truly seven-day service" by 2020.The documents, obtained by Channel 4 and the Guardian, also say there is a high risk of "workforce overload" and are said to show that senior officials are concerned over the lack of detailed costings, risk assessment, and limited data supporting the policy.The BBC has not seen the leaked register in full.'Lack of detail'According to Channel 4 News, another document which references a meeting with the 7 Day Services Governance Group, says: "The detailed costs of delivering in hospitals, including accurate estimates of additional workforce requirements are not understood early enough."  And according to a further document called Building The Evidence Base, no advance impact assessments have been done on how seven-day services will affect GPs, hospitals, and urgent and emergency care.One of the documents expresses fears that the policy may not deliver on its key aim of improving services at weekends.It states: "It is possible that the programme delivers the planned outputs, but this does not result in the desired change (delivering against the plan but missing the point)."British Medical Association head Dr Mark Porter said it had repeatedly raised concerns about the "lack of detail and absence of any plan" for the seven-day pledge.He added: "To see in black and white that the government has not only ignored these concerns - and those of other leading healthcare organisations - but has also disregarded its own risk assessment's warnings about the lack of staffing and funding needed to deliver further seven-day services, is both alarming and incredibly disappointing."

Labour shadow health secretary Diane Abbott said the leaked document was a "shocking indictment of the Tory government's plans". She added: "They pressed ahead with their proposals even when campaigners and NHS staff argued they were unworkable."It has now been confirmed by the advice the government received from its own civil servants. This is a scandal. The government is undermining the NHS with plans it knew to be unworkable."A Department of Health spokesman said: "Over the past six years, eight independent studies have set out the evidence for a 'weekend effect' - unacceptable variation in care across the week."This government is the first to tackle this, with a commitment to a safer, seven day NHS for patients and £10bn to fund the NHS's own plan for the future, alongside thousands of extra doctors and nurses on our wards."

                    Jeremy Corbyn has drawn supporters and opponents to the Labour Party
                

BBC political correspondent Chris Mason Amid the noise and the court cases, the rallies and the rancour, it is easy to overlook the extraordinary growth of the Labour movement: both those who've joined the party and those willing to sign up as supporters, at no small cost. It's provided a welcome fillip to Labour's meagre finances: the new registered supporters alone collectively handed the party more than £3.2m in just 48 hours last month. Over the last 40 years, membership numbers for the Conservatives and Labour have shrivelled; the Tory figure currently stands at around 150,000. The hundreds of thousands drawn to Labour's ranks appear driven by one man - Jeremy Corbyn - and a passionate desire to either endorse or reject him.In a speech in Tonyrefail, south Wales, Mr Smith promised to listen to Labour's supporters including creating a shadow cabinet of party members to advise the leadership.He said he would bind himself to decisions taken a Labour's annual conference, adding: "I will not seek to overturn it whatever my views, but I will seek to influence it."The former shadow work and pensions secretary said the party leadership had too often ignored the will of its conference on policy, citing Mr Corbyn's opposition to the UK's nuclear weapons despite a conference vote supporting them."No Labour leader has done this before and I believe it is necessary to reassure people across the party that there will be no backsliding on my watch," he said.Mr Smith also urged Mr Corbyn to condemn the booing by his supporters of London mayor Sadiq Khan - who has backed Mr Smith - when his name was mentioned at a rally.Mr Corbyn's campaign director Sam Tarry said Mr Khan had "burned his bridges" with hundreds of thousands of Labour members in London.Mr Tarry said Mr Corbyn's team was "pretty confident" he was going to win, as they published reform plans including mandatory collective bargaining in firms with more than 250 employees, the election of staff representatives to executive remuneration committees, and the introduction of "sectoral union bargaining rights"."We need to break open the closed circle of Westminster and Whitehall, and of the boardrooms too," Mr Corbyn said."Labour under my leadership will listen to ideas from the bottom up - and take radical action to transform and rebuild our country so that no-one and no community is left behind."His proposals also include:
Devolution of power to local councils, regions and nations
Replacing the House of Lords with an elected second chamber
Ending what he sees as a "revolving door" corporate grip on politics and the civil service
Increasing democracy in the community through more participation in budgeting and control of local services
Introducing a citizens' right to challenge the outsourcing and privatisation of local services through referendums

                    The report comes days after it was revealed radical cleric Anjem Choudary was convicted for inviting others to support so-called Islamic State
                

Extremist prisoners who "seek to poison the minds of others" will be put in special units in English and Welsh jails, the government has said.Justice Secretary Liz Truss also set out plans for the removal of extremist books from prison libraries and stronger vetting of prison chaplains. But the Prison Reform Trust warned many jails had been hit by staff cuts.It comes after a report found there was "complacency" at the "growing problem" of Islamist extremism in jails.The review into extremism in prisons, led by former prison governor Ian Acheson and published on Monday, found:
A "Muslim gang culture" and consequent violence, drug trafficking and criminality inspired or directed by these particular groups
Extremist prisoners advocating support for the so-called Islamic State, and threats against staff, other inmates and prison chaplains
"Charismatic" prisoners acting as self-styled "emirs" - a title sometimes used for Muslim leaders or military commanders - exerting a radicalising influence
Aggressive encouragement of conversions to Islam, and attempts by extremist prisoners to engineer segregation by landing, wing, or prison
Islamist radicals trying to get prison staff to leave during Friday prayers, attempts to prevent staff searches by claiming dress is religious, and an exploitation of staff concerns that they may be labelled racist
The prison wing housing only terroristsGoing undercover against extremismPrisons in England and Wales were at present "very far from being effective" in tackling extremism in prisons, Mr Acheson said. In response to the report, Ms Truss said the prison system "cannot continue" to allow some inmates to "peddle poisonous ideology across the mainstream prison population".The government will implement eight of the report's 11 recommendations, including creating a "small number" of specialist units to separate the "most subversive extremists".A similar "jail within a jail" system has been used in the Netherlands to tackle radicalisation.



Media captionAn ex-senior prison official weighs up the pros and cons of government plans on extremism
Ms Truss accepted there was a "risk" extremists could become more influential when kept together, but said authorities must keep apart those who might collaborate together to create more problems.The government will "take steps to remove extremist and offensive literature from prisons", and strengthen the vetting system for prison chaplains.Inmates "behaving subversively or promoting beliefs that run counter to fundamental British values" will be removed from Friday prayers.'Sinister side'Jamal - not his real name - who spent four years in prison for fraud, told the BBC how young men like him were targeted through initially friendly approaches."There was no talk of religion involved, there was no talk of radicalisation involved. It was just a very warm conversation... and they want to share some experience and camaraderie to boost your spirits a bit and that's how it starts. "And then... the rhetoric changes. And you start seeing the more sinister side."



Media captionJustice Secretary Liz Truss: 'Rooting out prison extremism is key'
'Extremist' books remained in prisons despite warningWarning over Islamic radicalisation in England's prisonsPublication of the report comes a few days after it was revealed that radical cleric Anjem Choudary had been convicted of inviting others to support so-called Islamic State.Fears have been voiced that Choudary, who is due to be sentenced in September, would be able to influence other inmates with his views.But Daniel Sandford said that creating special units within prisons was not without risks. When some IRA prisoners were concentrated in Whitemoor prison in the 1990s, they were viewed as having gained too much control in the high-security unit and managed to escape, he said.'Hardest hit' Former prison governor and now director of the Prison Reform Trust Peter Dawson said the special units could be effective if they were used as a short term measure with a focus on rehabilitating segregated inmates "to change the way they behave and think". But he warned the strategy only dealt with "half of the problem", as the Acheson report raised serious concerns about radicalisation in lower-security prisons, which had been "hardest hit" by staff cuts in recent years.Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, welcomed the focus on prisons, saying they had been "spaces where extremism has permeated and radicalised inmates" for too long.But the government must "be wary of creating a colony of jihadists", he added, calling for careful thought about who was placed in such units and for how long.

I believe Owen can unite our party, and move us on from the divisions that exist under the current UK leadership of Jeremy Corbyn."A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said a majority of Scottish Labour members would be backing him in the ballot. Mr Corbyn also won the backing of most of the local branches in Scotland which backed a candidate.A hustings debate between the two leadership candidates will be held at the SECC in Glasgow on Thursday evening, with the winner of the contest due to be announced on 24 September.

                    Mr Corbyn and Mr Smith are to meet in a hustings debate in Glasgow on Thursday evening
                

 "My only public comment on Jeremy Corbyn's leadership before this contest was to say that he had lost the confidence of his parliamentary colleagues in Westminster."That's a fact. More than 80% of Labour MPs expressed a lack of confidence in Jeremy's leadership."If 80% of my colleagues in Scottish Parliament didn't support me I wouldn't be able to do the job - even though I received 72% of the votes when party members and trade unionists in Scotland elected me to be their leader."That remains my position today. I don't think Jeremy can unite our party and lead us into government.'Credible plan'Ms Dugdale later admitted to BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that thought the Labour Party was in a "very, very difficult place" and had been "ripping itself apart". But the MSP insisted Mr Smith represented the "best mix of radical Labour politics with a credible plan to get back into government"."It's not about throwing bricks at Jeremy Corbyn saying he's wrong person for the job," she added.Ms Dugdale said: "I know that it will annoy and frustrate some people that I've spoken out but I'm doing what I think is right. I'm standing by my principles and I'm speaking up and I think it's important that I do."She has also said she does not think there is any chance of Scottish Labour splitting, regardless of the outcome of the leadership contest. Mr Smith said he was "incredibly proud" to have been endorsed by Ms Dugdale.He added: "Kezia and I want to see a strong Labour Party that can defeat the Tories in Westminster and take the fight to the SNP in Holyrood."But that will only be achieved if we can unite our party and demonstrate we have a radical, credible plan to rebuild communities right across the United Kingdom."Union supportBut a spokesman for Mr Corbyn's campaign said: "Kezia has one vote, just like every other member of the Scottish Labour Party, but all the indications, both from canvassing and CLP nominations, are that a majority of Labour party members in Scotland will be backing Jeremy Corbyn."  Scotland's biggest trade union, Unite, has also re-affirmed its endorsement of Mr Corbyn, who it said had been given an "overwhelming mandate" by Labour members less than a year ago.The union's Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, said: "Jeremy Corbyn became leader thanks to a movement of tens of thousands of ordinary people who want fairness, democracy and equality at the heart of our politics, and who have made the Labour Party the largest political party in western Europe."Labour leadership election timetable19-20 July: The number of MP nominations for each candidate was published20 July: Deadline for people to sign up as a registered supporter closed22 August: Ballot papers start to be sent out in the post (Labour Party members only) and by email21 September: Deadline for ballot papers to be returned is midday24 September: The result will be announced at a special conference in Liverpool

                    The three Rotherham MPs all deny the allegations
                

Three MPs in South Yorkshire are being investigated by police over alleged electoral expenses fraud.Labour MPs Sir Kevin Barron (Rother Valley), Sarah Champion (Rotherham) and John Healey (Wentworth and Dearne) have all denied the allegations.South Yorkshire Police said it was in the early stages of an inquiry into alleged expenses fraud in Rotherham during the 2015 general election.It is assessing whether the deadline for investigations can be extended."Officers are currently collating information to assess whether an application for an extension to the 12-month parameters on the time to investigate could be obtained from the courts," the force said.Sir Kevin, who is chairman of the House of Commons standards committee, said: "All my elections expenses were declared within the law and the rules set out by the Electoral Commission."Mr Healey said: "These allegations are simply wrong. My expenses for the 2015 general election were reported fully in accordance with the law and the rules set out by the Electoral Commission."Ms Champion has not yet responded to requests for a comment from the BBC.

Former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Heseltine has dismissed reports Theresa May could "kill off" George Osborne's elected mayor project.The push for English cities and regions to elect a "London-style" mayor was a key policy for the last government as it devolved powers out of Whitehall.But the Times claims the new PM is considering dropping the policy.Lord Heseltine, a champion of the elected mayor model, said: "I don't think it's true."Downing Street said areas that did not want an elected mayor would not have one forced on them, saying this did not represent a change in government policy.However, in all of the devolution deals struck to date, adopting the model was a requirement.BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said Mrs May's government did not seem to be as "evangelical" about elected mayors as Mr Osborne and David Cameron had been.Lord Heseltine carried out a review into devolution for David Cameron's coalition government in which he called for the expansion of elected mayors despite the change being largely rejected in a series of a referendums. The Tory peer said to cancel the policy would appeal to "those who want the status quo", saying councils bidding for new powers "have got to show that you have the management ability and direct accountability to do the man sized job that we are offering you".The Times claimed Mrs May was "nervous" about giving a platform to senior Labour figures like former minister Andy Burnham, who is the party's candidate to be mayor of Greater Manchester.It also said she was concerned the policy was causing "huge angst" in other areas where there was local hostility to mayors being imposed.Asked about the report, Lord Heseltine told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was "very unlikely" Mrs May, who is currently on holiday, would be "initiating policies of this sort".Last week Mrs May said elected mayors would give a "powerful new voice" to Sheffield and the West Midlands.She made the comments in regional newspaper articles pledging her support for Mr Osborne's flagship "Northern Powerhouse" project - which The Times also claims she could phase out - as well as the "Midlands Engine" around Birmingham.The Northern Powerhouse is the name attached to the government's bid to create a rival economy to London and the South East in the north of England.Mr Burnham said it would be "deeply concerning" if Mrs May was "going cold on English devolution".But the Labour leadership of Cambridge City Council said devolution would work better without the requirement for an elected mayor, urging the government to postpone the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough mayoral election planned for May 2017.The government said next year's elections would take place.







Home Office doctors gave the go-ahead for experimental drug trials on children at two approved schools in the 1960s, National Archives files show.Parents were not consulted and the issue of consent was left to managers.At Richmond Hill Approved School in North Yorkshire, housing pupils aged 15 and older, the most disruptive boys were given an anticonvulsant drug to see if it would control behaviour.The trial of a sedative on girls at a school near Leeds did not proceed. The proposal had been to give all girls at Springhead Park Approved School in Rothwell, which cared for 14 and 15-year-olds, Haloperidol, a powerful sedative now used largely as an anti-psychotic.'Restless and aggressive'Approved Schools were on a level between between a children's home and Borstal.  While children were usually sent there by juvenile courts, they were not imprisoned; the sites were funded and inspected by the Home Office and run by voluntary organisations. The National Archives files feature discussions about the plans for the drug trials from three doctors who are all now deceased. In a document dating from late 1967, Dr JR Hawkings, a psychiatrist attached to Richmond Hill, wrote to the Home Office asking permission to conduct a drug trial on boys who were "impulsive, explosive, irritable, restless and aggressive".

He wanted to give some of them a drug called Beclamide. The anticonvulsant, which has sedative effects and was prescribed for epilepsy, is no longer widely in use.Although Dr Hawkings said this would be "a perfectly normal and legitimate therapy for certain types of disturbed adolescent", he also said that it had not been widely tested on such boys. It was to be a "double blind" trial, with a control group given a placebo, and another group given the drug.But there is no indication that the trial was discussed or explained to participants, or any suggestion that their consent was sought.'Maximum support'The papers show Home Office psychiatrist Dr Pamela Mason welcomed Dr Hawkings's plan. On 1 November 1967 she wrote: "From the clinical or practical point of view these are the boys that can produce considerable problems within a school and this sort of research into possible drug treatment is to be welcomed... "I would recommend maximum support for this project." According to notes on the file, the trial went ahead in 1968, with boys given the drug for six months. There is no record of the outcome in the documents, nor could I find any published paper in medical journals.And the files show the school headmaster told the Home Office that "in view of assurances from the school doctor, from Dr Hawkings… and from the doctor acting for the manufacturers, the managers had decided that there was no need to consult the parents".'In strict confidence'Bob Hammal, a teacher at Richmond Hill between 1968 and 1972, was appalled to learn of the trial.  He remembered there were challenges - but generally recalls a good relationship between staff and the boys.  



Media captionFormer teacher Bob Hammal says he was shocked by the revelations
"What really did shock me more than anything was that parental consent was not sought and was not thought to be necessary by the powers-that-be," he said.He believes that had he, or other colleagues, known at the time, they would have tried to stop it, or acted as a whistleblower if that was not possible.As the Richmond Hill trial got under way, a second trial was proposed, again by a school psychiatrist, at Springhead Park Approved School for girls in Rothwell near Leeds.This was a sister school to the better known Duncroft in Surrey, a small institution for girls of higher intelligence. In November 1968, Dr Joyce Galbraith wrote to Dr Mason at the Home Office "in strict confidence". She said she was increasingly concerned about the tone of the school and unrest amongst the staff. To calm the situation, she suggested giving Haloperidol to every girl in the school, for 18 weeks. She wrote: "My suggestion is that we should try some form of drug trial to see if, by allaying the anxiety of the girls chemically, we might perhaps settle the school a little bit more, and give the staff an opportunity to put their own house in order…"'Not the solution'Again, Dr Mason supported the plan.The papers in the the National Archives show she wrote: "I think this sounds a valuable treatment approach to the very real problems that arise from the special nature of girls in residence and in particular the problems presented by younger immature disturbed adolescent girls."



Media captionShelagh Sunner: "They weren't mentally sick kids- they were maladjusted kids" 
The files also show that Shelagh Sunner, headmistress of the school between 1966 and 1982, did not support the trial.Speaking to the BBC about the National Archives material, she said drugs were not the solution for "her" girls."They weren't mentally sick kids" she said. "They needed to work through their emotions."The trial did not take place after the school's managers blocked it, worried about what the girls' parents would think. Ms Sunner said she was not surprised, though, that the Home Office endorsed it. "I think they were scratching their head about what they were going to do with this generation of maladjusted kids - because the approved schools were full and there were a lot of them."Were you a pupil in the 1960s, and did your school take part in drug trials?

The union's executive committee endorsed Mr Corbyn in a meeting in July.General secretary Mick Whelan said: "We are backing Jeremy again because he believes in the core values and the key aspirations of the Labour Party and proposes to run on a platform, at the next general election, which will excite voters put off by the failed focus group-obsessed machinations of the New Labour years."Bectu - UndeclaredThe union for media workers has not taken a position in the leadership race."In keeping with past practice Bectu neither made a nomination for a Labour leadership candidate, nor recommended either of those who entered the contest," union officer Tony Lennon wrote in a message to members.BFAWU (Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union) - Jeremy CorbynAt a conference in June, the bakers' union voted that "if there was any challenge to Mr Corbyn's leadership, our union would continue to support the current, democratically elected incumbent and the progressive policies he has put forward". National president Ian Hodgson wrote that under Jeremy Corbyn "the Labour Party now represented and supported the aspirations of our members".

TSSA - Jeremy CorbynThe Transport Salaried Staffs' Association, which backed Jeremy Corbyn in 2015, reaffirmed its support for him in July."With a new leader at the head of the Conservative Party and the Tories looking set to remain in a prolonged period of bitter rivalry and infighting, it is for Labour to unite and be the source of national unity and stability for the country," the union said in a press release.UCATT - Jeremy CorbynThe construction union has nominated Jeremy Corbyn for Labour leader."This is an unnecessary and divisive election but now it has been triggered it is essential that Jeremy receives an even larger mandate than he did in 2015 and that the Labour Party then properly unites behind him," said acting general secretary Brian Rye.Unison - Jeremy CorbynThe second largest union, Unison, has backed Jeremy Corbyn over Owen Smith."Jeremy Corbyn retains the backing of a majority of UNISON's Labour supporting members," said general secretary Dave Prentis. "However, a significant minority backed Owen Smith. Their views will always be respected in our union - that's our proud tradition."

                    Mr Duncan Smith warned ministers not to try to negotiate some form of "EU-lite" agreement
                

Prime Minister Theresa May should begin formal negotiations for the UK to leave the EU "as soon as possible", Iain Duncan Smith has said. Writing in the Sun on Sunday, the Brexit campaigner accused Remain supporters of trying to delay a triggering of Article 50, which starts the two-year process to leave the EU. It comes after Mrs May said she would not trigger Article 50 this year. Mr Duncan Smith said she should start the process "early" in 2017. Waiting for forthcoming elections to take place in Germany and France would be "another attempt to turn this referendum result into a 'neverendum'," the former work and pensions secretary said."For too long membership of the EU sapped our sense of self-worth and our self-confidence. Now we have the chance to believe in Britain again," he wrote."Let us leave as soon as possible, so that we can get on and make the most of our new found independence."

                    Theresa May has said Article 50 will not be triggered until next year.
                

Speaking in Berlin last month, Mrs May said securing a "sensible and orderly departure" from the EU would take time. She also insisted that the UK would not "walk away" from Europe and wanted to retain the "closest economic links".Mrs May said the UK was in no rush to trigger the process for leaving the EU, saying that although "this would not please everyone" it was right to hold off until the UK's "objectives were clear". The German and French leaders have suggested no special exceptions can be made for Britain in terms of continued access to the EU's single market if, as Mrs May has insisted, the UK seeks controls on freedom of movement rules.But Mr Duncan Smith warned ministers not to try to negotiate some form of "EU-lite" agreement which would see Britain remain subject to European law. This would be to "ignore the clear message delivered by the millions of citizens who voted for Leave," he said."Tired of handing over billions of their hard-earned money to the wasteful EU bureaucrats, it [the referendum result] was an order from the British people to Britain's ruling elite - an order to 'take back control'. "That, simply put, means control of our borders, our trade arrangements, our money and our laws," he said.Brexit 'returns control'Mr Duncan Smith also insisted Britain did not need a deal which allowed it to remain part of the European single market, arguing there was a "strong case" in economic terms for leaving.He said that Britain did not need to be a member of the single market to trade with it, and may well be better off outside."Being outside returns control over laws and borders and frees the UK from EU regulations, its external tariff and allows us, as a service sector economy, to position ourselves globally, set our trade deals and compete internationally, particularly in financial services."The first time that Mrs May will face all 27 other EU leaders at the same time will be at October's European Council meeting.







Media captionKhan tells the BBC: Corbyn "has failed to win the trust and respect of the British people"
London Mayor Sadiq Khan has urged Labour voters to ditch Jeremy Corbyn as leader and vote for Owen Smith in the party's leadership contest. Mr Khan told BBC News Mr Corbyn had "failed to win the trust and respect of the British people".But a Corbyn campaign spokesman said Mr Khan won the London mayoralty standing on a Labour platform which the party leader backed.The mayor was, however, "entitled to his opinion", the spokesman added.Mr Khan said Mr Corbyn had "failed to organise an effective team", and he also criticised his involvement in the EU referendum campaign, saying he "failed to provide the leadership to persuade people to remain in the EU"."I'm afraid his stance the day after [the referendum] - calling for us to leave the EU immediately - demonstrates to me why I think Owen Smith is the right leader for our party, and why I think he's the best chance we've got to win the next election," he added.Guide to the Labour leadership electionMatt Wrack, the general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, described Mr Khan's comments as "disappointing but possibly no great surprise". "Sadiq comes from that part of the Labour Party that was in government under Blair and Brown," Mr Wrack told BBC News."It is disappointing nevertheless. Jeremy Corbyn gave full support for Sadiq in his campaign for mayor, as did a number of unions including my own."

                    Owen Smith said he was "hugely honoured" to have Sadiq Khan's support
                

Mr Smith, the former work and pensions spokesman, is challenging Mr Corbyn for Labour's top job, after the leader lost a no-confidence vote of his MPs in June.MPs who voted against Mr Corbyn have criticised his leadership and his performance during the EU referendum, but supporters have argued that he has been undermined by his opponents in the party. This week at a hustings event, Mr Corbyn insisted that he could reach out beyond his core supporters and win over "some people that have been tempted to vote Tory".Mr Khan, who became mayor in May, has until now remained neutral in the leadership contest.But writing in the Observer, he said Mr Corbyn's personal ratings were "the worst of any opposition leader on record"."He has lost the confidence of more than 80% of Labour's MPs in Parliament - and I am afraid we simply cannot afford to go on like this," he wrote."And you can't just blame a 'hostile media' and let Jeremy and his team off the hook."I know from my own election - up against a nasty and divisive Tory campaign - that if we are strong and clear enough in our convictions, the message will get through to the public. "That's a test that Jeremy totally failed in the EU referendum. Why would things be different in a general election?"'Hugely honoured'Explaining his backing for Mr Smith, Mr Khan added: "On the big issues Owen and I have been on the same side of the argument, including opposing the Iraq War. "Owen led and - more importantly, won - our fight against the Tories' unfair cuts to tax credits and disability allowances, which would have hurt the most disadvantaged people in our society."Mr Smith said he was "hugely honoured" to have Mr Khan's support."Sadiq ran a fantastic campaign to win power for Labour in London this year, securing a huge mandate from party members and the electorate," he said.Labour leadership election timetable

"He showed that a vision of hope and optimism can win, if it's backed up with a credible plan to deliver real meaningful change for people's lives."Speaking on Friday, Mr Corbyn said his message appealed "all across the country".He pledged to "win over people... by the policies we put forward", such as decent housing and security at work, including "some people that have been tempted to vote Tory" in the past.The Labour leadership contest result will be announced on 24 September.

                    Lord Rix opposed the Assisted Dying Bill in 2006
                

Actor and disability campaigner Lord Rix has died aged 92, his family said.The president of the learning disability charity Mencap had been terminally ill and urged Parliament to change the law on assisted dying.He had previously opposed an assisted dying law, but said his illness had left him "like a beached whale" and in constant discomfort.As Brian Rix, he performed on stage and TV, specialising in a series of post-war "Whitehall farce" comedies.For more than 30 years his farces, which starred the likes of comic greats Tommy Cooper and Sid James, were hits on TV and stage, and earned Rix the reputation for his trousers always falling down.ReformsIt was after his eldest daughter was born in 1951 with Down's syndrome that he began campaigning for people with learning disabilities.From 1980 to 1988 he was secretary general of Mencap, becoming chairman in 1988 and then president 10 years later - a role he occupied until his death.In 2006 short breaks for carers became Law - an issue he had been lobbying on for 12 years. In the same year he introduced amendments to the Childcare Bill, which extended childcare provision for disabled children from 16 to 18. His work on the 2006 Electoral Administration Bill also led to people with a learning disability being able to vote.The crossbench peer voted against an Assisted Dying Bill in 2006 because of concerns that people with learning disabilities might become the unwilling victims of euthanasia.  But his own experience of dying led him to change his position.

Rix quit performing in 1977, bowing out during an emotional evening at the Whitehall where he ended a period of 26 years of live performances, both at the Whitehall and at the Garrick to which he had transferred his productions in 1967.He was still a partner in a production company which put on a number of hit shows in the West End.But… an increasing amount of his time was being spent campaigning on behalf of people with learning difficulties, something that had started with the arrival of his eldest daughter, Shelley, in 1951 who was born with Down's syndrome.Rix was appalled to discover that there was no support for children with this condition other than a place in an institution where there was little or no attempt to provide any stimulus, let alone education.Brian Rix: full obituary



'Unique charm'Jan Tregelles, chief executive of Mencap, who described Lord Rix as an "extraordinary man", said: "When Lord Rix's daughter, Shelley, was born with a learning disability he and his wife Elspet were told to put her away, and forget about her.  "This started a quest lasting over 60 years to make the world a better place for all those with a learning disability."His unique charm, personality and passion have been invaluable in helping Mencap grow."Peter Jenkins, campaigns director at the charity Leonard Cheshire Disability, said Lord Rix "made an immense contribution to the cause of disability rights in this country" and would be "greatly missed".Mark Atkinson, the chief executive of disability charity Scope, said Lord Rix "worked passionately and tirelessly to improve society for disabled people".'Slip away peacefully'Lord Rix, who died on Saturday morning, wrote to the speaker of the House of Lords earlier this month, explaining why he wanted legislation pushed through to allow those in his situation to be helped to die."Unhappily, my body seems to be constructed in such a way that it keeps me alive in great discomfort when all I want is to be allowed to slip into a sleep, peacefully, legally and without any threat to the medical or nursing profession," he wrote."I am sure there are many others like me who having finished with life wish their life to finish."Only with a legal euthanasia Bill on the statute books will the many people who find themselves in the same situation as me be able to slip away peacefully in their sleep instead of dreading the night."

Manchester is certainly basking in a golden glow from Rio with a host of the medal winners living and training in the area.The velodrome training centre for Team GB's track cycling athletes, who have brought home 11 Olympic medals, is based in the city with many of the team living nearby - including Sir Bradley Wiggins. Jason Kenny, now one of Britain's most decorated Olympians, hails from Bolton in Greater Manchester while team pursuit gold-medallist Steve Burke comes from nearby Colne in Lancashire.Taekwondo star Jade Jones, originally from Flint in north Wales, now lives and trains in Manchester.Rower Matt Langridge, who won gold in Rio with the men's eight, was born in Crewe and grew up in Northwich, Cheshire.A number of athletes also bringing home medals live over the border in Yorkshire. The Brownlee brothers, diver Jack Laugher and cyclist Ed Clancy are all proud Yorkshiremen.Mrs May said: "For the past fortnight, the people of the United Kingdom have been filled with pride as we've watched our Olympians take victory in so many sports with power, grace and control."In every discipline and at every stage, Team GB have shown the world what we're made of: determination, dignity and true sportsmanship."They haven't just made history; by showing just how far talent and hard work can take you, they have inspired the next generation."They have also shown the importance of supporting elite sport and that is something this government remains wholly committed to."Smaller parades are expected to be held for individual athletes in their home towns.The town council in Stone, Staffordshire, has said it will hold a parade for K1 slalom gold medallist Joe Clarke, 23, who will be hoisted aloft in his kayak on 29 August. ITV is also planning to switch off all seven of its channels for an hour on 27 August to encourage people to take part in sport as part of the I Am Team GB campaign.

Britain's spies should be allowed to continue harvesting large amounts of data from emails, the government's reviewer of terror legislation said.David Anderson has published a review of so-called bulk interception powers.He found there was no viable alternative to the use of the powers by GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 in the fight against terror.He also backed the hacking of phones and computers "in principle", with some reservations.The operational case for this kind of surveillance, known as "bulk equipment interference," was "not yet proven" as it had yet to be used, he said.'Serious threats'His findings are a boost for Prime Minister Theresa May, who ordered the review when she was home secretary, in response to privacy concerns raised by Labour.Many of the practices investigated by Mr Anderson, who was given access to details of operations by British spies in Afghanistan and other foreign territories, had been secret until recently.They will be put on a firm legal footing by the government's Investigatory Powers Bill, dubbed the "snooper's charter" by critics, which is due to return to Parliament later this year.

                    Theresa May welcomed the review's findings
                

 The review focused on the activities of the security services and did not examine the case for the retention of internet records for 12 months - the other controversial aspect of the bill. In a statement, Mrs May said: "Mr Anderson's report demonstrates how the bulk powers contained in the Investigatory Powers Bill are of crucial importance to our security and intelligence agencies. "These powers often provide the only means by which our agencies are able to protect the British public from the most serious threats that we face. It is vital that we retain them, while ensuring their use is subject to robust safeguards and world-leading oversight which are enshrined in the IP Bill."Shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham welcomed the report but said it was "concerning" that Mrs May had not accepted it in full. "She and the home secretary must accept the report in its entirety and deliver on the separate concessions extracted by Labour in the Commons - tougher restrictions on the use of Internet Connection Records and stronger protections for journalists and lawyers," he said.Afghanistan hostagesBulk interception differs from targeted interception - bugging a suspect's phone for example - in that it involves the harvesting of large quantities of data from the internet and emails. The data is then sifted and sorted by investigators.In his review, David Anderson said bulk powers were used by Britain's spy agencies for "cyber-defence, counter-espionage and counterterrorism," as well as investigations into child sexual abuse and organised crime. Alternative methods of gathering data were available but were "often less effective, more dangerous, more resource-intensive, more intrusive or slower," the review says.He backed three kinds of bulk data acquisition:
Bulk interception: The tapping of internet cables by GCHQ to target suspects outside the UK. The review says this is of "vital utility" to the security and intelligence agencies, citing the case of a kidnapping in Afghanistan that would have led to the killing of hostages, if spies had not used these powers.
Bulk acquisition of communications data: The gathering of data about communications but not the content of it. Only disclosed publicly in November last year, for MI5 it has "contributed significantly" to the disruption of terrorist operations, Mr Anderson's report said.  
Bulk personal data sets: Databases of personal information, which could include everything from the electoral register to supermarket loyalty schemes, which the security services acquire openly or covertly.
But he expressed some reservations about a fourth practice - bulk equipment interference, which involves hacking into smart phones or computers over "a large geographical area", saying there was "a distinct (though not yet proven) operational case" for it. Unlike the other bulk powers described in the review, this one has yet to be used, it says.Mr Anderson also recommended that an independent panel of technical experts be set up to advise about the impact of changing technology "on how MI5, MI6 and GCHQ could reduce the privacy footprint of their activities".'Wasted chance'Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael welcomed the report - but said it was now up to MPs and peers to scrutinise the Investigatory Powers Bill to ensure privacy intrusion is kept to a minimum.But he also criticised the fact that a similar review has not been carried out into plans to retain internet records, describing this as an "excessive and authoritarian measure that not only erodes our privacy but will likely to prove to be a waste of money and fall foul of our courts".Bella Sankey, policy director at campaign group Liberty, said: "Liberty called for an impartial, independent and expert inquiry into these intrusive powers - yet sadly this rushed review failed on all three counts."She added: "This was an opportunity to properly consider the range of targeted methods that could be used as effective alternatives to indiscriminate and potentially unlawful powers. That chance has been wasted."

                    Nathan Gill says attempts are being made to 'damage my reputation'
                

UKIP MEP Nathan Gill said allegations he misused European parliamentary funds are "entirely bogus".OLAF, the European anti-fraud body, is looking into the claims, although North Wales Police has said it is no longer investigating the matter. It relates to alleged use of European parliamentary funds for party political purposes, such as election campaigning.Mr Gill said he was "well aware of who are behind this latest poisonous and deeply malicious attack".In a statement on Friday, he said: "Having spoken to the police, I am in no doubt whatsoever that these claims - which are entirely bogus - have been made against me as part of an ongoing strategy to harry me out of position and to damage my reputation."Mr Gill announced on Wednesday he would sit as an independent member of the Welsh Assembly, following an acrimonious row with other UKIP members over whether he should he remain both an MEP and AM.'Commonplace'He said OLAF was obliged to investigate any allegations made to it."Such cases are commonplace but sadly can drag on for a long time," Mr Gill said.   "I will co-operate fully with that investigation to ensure it is brought to a close as soon as possible."An OLAF spokeswoman said: "OLAF can confirm that it is looking into allegations it has received in relation to Member of the European Parliament Nathan Gill. "Please note that the fact that OLAF assesses the information received does not mean that any individual in question is guilty of wrongdoing. "OLAF fully respects the presumption of innocence."North Wales Police said on Friday that "correspondence from [UK national fraud reporting centre] Action Fraud received on 11th August concerning allegations of fraud against an Anglesey man are being reviewed by OLAF, the European Antifraud Office of the European Union".  "As such North Wales Police will not be investigating the matter further," the force added. Neil Hamilton, the leader of the UKIP group in the assembly, has called on Mr Gill to publish his expenses and expenditure as an MEP since being elected in 2014.

Theresa May has vowed to press ahead with George Osborne's "Northern Powerhouse" despite having fired him as chancellor.In a Yorkshire Post article, the prime minister promised to "help the great cities and towns of the North pool their strengths and take on the world".This includes backing a bid to bring cycling's world championships to Yorkshire.She also said she would make the Midlands an "engine for growth".The Northern Powerhouse is the name attached to the government's bid to create a rival economy to London and the South East in the north of England.It involves devolving new powers from Whitehall, improving transport links and creating new regional mayors to act as figureheads for their regions.
Mrs May's language was similar to that used by Mr Osborne when he set out his vision to create "a collection of northern cities sufficiently close to each other that combined they can take on the world".On taking over as prime minister, she appointed Andrew Percy, the MP for the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire constituency of Brigg and Goole, as her Northern Powerhouse minister.

The UK voted to leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June. Here's your daily summer briefing of the latest Brexit-related news...  Recap for new readersThe UK public voted 52% to 48% to leave the European Union in June's referendum. During the campaign there were warnings from the Remain side about the economic impact of leaving, while the Leave side suggested the UK would be able to take back control of immigration and the £350m a week they said the UK sent to the EU. New Prime Minister Theresa May has said "Brexit means Brexit" - but no-one yet seems too sure what Brexit means. Will the UK stay as a member of the EU single market? Will EU nationals retain the right to live and work in the UK? What economic impact has the Brexit vote had?Monday 22 August

The main event: The leaders of Germany, France and Italy are holding an informal meeting to discuss the future of Europe in the wake of the Brexit vote. The venue is the tiny island of Ventotene off the coast of Naples, chosen for symbolic reasons. Two Italian prisoners, Altiero Spinelli and Ernesto Rossi, held on the island during the Second World War, wrote the "Ventotene Manifesto" calling for "a free and united Europe". Following their talks, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi will hold a news conference on the Italian aircraft carrier Garibaldi, which is coordinating the EU's migrant rescue operation. Ahead of the talks, Mr Renzi wrote that the leaders wanted "to relaunch an ideal based on unity and peace, freedom and dreams, dialogue and identity".Also in the news: Prominent referendum Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith has said Prime Minister Theresa May should begin formal negotiations for the UK to leave the EU "as soon as possible". He accused Remain supporters of trying to delay a triggering of Article 50, which starts the two-year process to leave the EU. Mrs May said she would not trigger Article 50 during 2016 but Mr Duncan Smith said she should start the process "early" in 2017, arguing that this would enable the UK to "get on and make the most of our new found independence".Financial news: There is potential for a lose-lose situation when negotiations for the UK to leave the European Union take place, according to the director of a Brussels-based economic think tank. Guntrum Wolff of the Bruegel Institute told the BBC: "If both sides take a confrontational stance, they will both lose." Mr Wolff also said the possibility of another EU member country following the UK's Brexit lead is unlikely, though there were causes for concern including low growth in the Eurozone.

From the papers: Many papers lead with Team GB's Olympics success but the Financial Times warns that infrastructure spending has "declined sharply since the vote to leave the EU". The paper reports: "The value of contracts for July dropped to £1.5bn, a fall of 20% against the previous month and 23% lower than a year ago." This will put pressure on Theresa May "to press ahead" with new projects, the FT says. The PM might be aided in this by her Chancellor, if the FT's profile of Philip Hammond is anything to go by. Mr Hammond's "sober" image belies a "lively, risk-taking past" in business, the paper says, describing him as "a product of the swashbuckling Thatcher era". Over at the Guardian are two contrasting views of Brexit. Economist Anatole Kaletsky recalls the legend of King Canute and writes that the referendum result will "not turn back the economic tides driven by globalisation". He predicts: "As Britain's economy sinks into recession, and the government's promises of a quick 'successful Brexit' prove unrealistic, public opinion will shift." However, a piece at the weekend by the paper's own economics editor, Larry Elliott, says it is "obvious that the sky has not fallen in as a result of the referendum, and those who said it would look a bit silly". Mr Elliott says only "an extremely deep and prolonged recession" would make him regret voting to leave the EU's "failed project".Further reading:

And finally... An alternative Olympics medals table, prepared by a German PR firm and tweeted by the European Parliament, has generated quite a press reaction. The US topped the official table for Rio 2016 with 46 gold medals, with Team GB in second place with 27. However, Euro-Informationen in Berlin combined the medals haul of EU member states to put the European Union top with 106 golds - but this also removed Team GB's separate ranking, as the UK is still an EU member. "How dare EU?" asked the Sun. "Cycling couple Laura Trott and Jason Kenny have won over twice as many medals in Rio as the whole of Belgium combined but Berlin agency claims them for 'winning team'." Zoe Strimpel in the Telegraph declared: "The truly amusing irony is that this ghastly competitor tops the chart largely because of the incredible medal haul of Britain, the very country it is currently absorbed in shaming and punishing for its rankly disobedient vote in June to leave the EU." However, the Independent calls the list "the Olympics medals table Brexiters don't want you to see". It calls Team GB's performance in Rio "brilliant" but argues that the UK would be top of the medals table if it competed as part of an "all-EU team".Friday 19 August

                    Teams across the City and Whitehall have been working on a plan for Britain's EU exit, says the FT
                

The main event: The City of London is seeking a "bespoke deal" having given up hope of getting full access to the European Union's single market, according to the Financial Times. The newspaper says those representing the financial sector will present their ideas to the government next month. The newspaper says the City thinks a Norway-style deal - with access to the single market but accepting free movement of people and contributing to the budget - would be "politically and practically very difficult" and is seeking its own "unique" deal - possibly a "beefed up version" of that used by Switzerland. BBC business correspondent Jonty Bloom says the Swiss deal with the EU would not be sufficient for the City because it does not include  "passporting", which currently allows international banks and businesses based in London to do business anywhere in the EU.Also in the news: The UK government has reported a smaller budget surplus than expected in July. It was in surplus by £1bn in July - compared with £1.2bn in July 2015. The government said the fact the public finances were in surplus showed the economy was in a "position of strength" to face post-referendum challenges. Meanwhile a Plaid Cymru MP has accused the Welsh government of a "reckless indifference" to the country's needs in the way it has responded to the Brexit vote. Jonathan Edwards contrasted Labour First Minister Carwyn Jones's approach with that of the SNP in Scotland - Mr Jones's office dismissed the complaints as "ridiculous". And it's not just the City of London putting its wish-list for European deals to the government, according to Bloomberg. It says tech firms and data-centre operators want a deal that "keeps internet borders open" - European online shoppers' details currently "zip across borders to giant data centres in the UK" - amid concerns that changing data-protection agreements could lead to legal challenges. Financial news: Following on from the slightly baffling "They will soon be calling me MR BREXIT!" tweet from US Presidential candidate Donald Trump, the Telegraph's Tim Wallace has laid out why he believes Mr Trump is a "bigger threat to the global economy" than the UK's decision to leave the EU. In the Financial Times, BBC Money Box presenter Paul Lewis argues that the current weakness of the pound means the £75,000 limit on the amount of savings protected if a bank goes bust should rise.From the papers: There's been a bit of number crunching as the papers try to weigh up Brexit's impact on the economy, two months on. The Guardian looks back at the week's economic data to see if it amounts to "boom or gloom?"  while the Telegraph comes down on the "boom" side of the argument, claiming it has the "five charts which show Britain has escaped an economics apocalypse". However elsewhere in the Telegraph, Allister Heath says that economists should "relearn a little humility" and admit that they cannot yet grasp the impact of a massive event such as Brexit as it is "far too soon" to tell. The Economist examines the difficulties of trying to leave the EU within the allotted two-year period, once Article 50 has been triggered, when trade deals are years in the making.Further reading:The Spectator says "it's time to defend Brexit", arguing there has been "silence" from Vote Leave and: "Brexit risks being defined by its enemies and moulded to fit their caricature." Harry Phibbs, for Heatst.com, says reality is "finally silencing the Brexit doom-mongers" following news of a fall in unemployment claims and a boost to retail sales in July.YouGov says its polling suggests most people - 69% to 22% - believe, to quote Theresa May, "Brexit means Brexit" but there is little support for a "hard Brexit" with the UK leaving without seeking any formal trading relationship.And finally...

The UK correspondent of Germany's Die Welt, Thomas Kielinger, says its history shows it has the ability to adapt and England is "not yet lost". "You just need to look at the Olympic medal table," he adds. Other European press commentators think otherwise.Thursday 18 August

The main event: A new report from the Equality and Human Rights Commission has highlighted a "very worrying combination of a post-Brexit rise in hate crime and long-term systemic unfairness and race inequality", in the words of its chairman David Isaac. The review found that black and ethnic minority people in Britain still face "entrenched" race inequality in many areas including health, education, employment and housing. BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said the report also concluded there had been "a spike in racism and hate crime in England and Wales after the Brexit vote" while Scotland, where a majority voted to remain in the EU, showed lower levels of hate crime. The commission said "the evidence suggests the minority of people with racist attitudes used that result to legitimise racism", our reporter added, though he cautioned that the report's footnotes say the spike could also be due to "increased reporting of these events".Also in the news: A former Conservative Party treasurer has suggested the departure of David Cameron and George Osborne following the Brexit vote may have been "unnecessary". Peter Cruddas, who was a key financial backer of the Vote Leave campaign, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money that he couldn't understand why the then-PM and chancellor risked their positions by backing Remain. "I couldn't see why the politicians - the prime minister and the chancellor - really took sides," he said. "You know it's up to the people to decide, are we in are we out? Sure they can give their opinions, but to campaign hard for one side left them in an untenable position. And I still don't understand why they left themselves in an untenable position." Mr Cameron resigned as prime minister following the referendum result and Mr Osborne left the cabinet when Theresa May took over.Financial news: The Co-operative Bank has said economic uncertainty following the UK's Brexit vote may hamper growth. The bank, which almost collapsed in 2013, after bad property loans contributed to a £1.5bn hole in its finances, said market conditions are "challenging" for retail banks. The Bank of England lowered interest rates at the beginning of August to a record low, as part of measures to stimulate the UK economy after the Brexit vote. Co-op Bank said the vote could also lead to a contraction in the UK property market, affecting mortgage loan growth. While banks might be feeling the pinch, warmer weather and a weaker pound helped boost retail sales in July, according to official data. The retail data went against expectations of an immediate hit to consumer confidence from the UK's vote to leave the European Union - though some analysts predicted tougher times ahead. And the weaker pound could benefit farmers, who - for the time being - still receive payments under the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The payments are calculated in euros, meaning there could be a 15% increase in farmers' EU subsidies once they're converted into sterling - about an extra £500m.

From the papers: The Telegraph's business section reports that ratings agency Moody's predicts that "Britain's economy will slow down but will not go anywhere close to a recession". The agency says a fall in sterling should offset the "negative effect" of post-Brexit vote uncertainty, though risks including further hikes in US interest rates "could derail this forecast". The Financial Times says a fall in UK unemployment figures in July are "a sign of the labour market's resilience after June's vote to leave the EU", although a fall in vacancies sent a gloomier signal. Elsewhere, Wednesday's figures showing the number of EU workers in the UK has risen to 2.2m attracts the attention of the leader writers in three of the papers that backed Brexit. The Daily Express call on the prime minister to "demonstrate a firm commitment to border controls" during the Brexit negotiations. "Nobody wants to see the EU workers currently living here threatened with deportation," the paper says. "However it remains the case that we cannot accept a never-ending flow of new arrivals." The Sun says: "Jobs, wages and public services are under enormous strain. Brexit has handed Mrs May the mandate to fix that historic error." Meanwhile, the Daily Mail urges the prime minister to "hurry up and seize" the "great opportunities for a self-governing Britain" that it says Brexit provides.Further reading:

                    Say hello to "Mr Brexit"
                

The British Olympic Association has told a leading Brexit campaign group to stop using Team GB images in its social media posts. The group has received a letter - which it posted on its website - warning that its use of "Olympic-related intellectual property" was an infringement of the BOA's rights. Leave.EU said it would "continue to publish stories that showcase how Britain is thriving as we Leave the European Union" and accused the BOA of suing it "for pointing out how great Team GB are doing". However, the BOA said no legal action had been taken. Across the pond, US presidential candidate Donald Trump has, for some reason nobody seems able to fathom, tweeted: "They will soon be calling me MR. BREXIT!" As ex-Labour MP Ed Balls knows only too well, such cryptic tweeting invites merciless mockery. "Just to clarify for any Americans reading, we Britons have no idea what 'MR BREXIT' means either," read one tweet, while another Twitter user wrote: "Mr Brexit sounds like the worst superhero ever." And a Mr Brexit tweeted: "They will soon be calling me MR. TRUMP!". The Republican candidate was a keen supporter of Britain's exit from the EU, predicting, after the result, that the country would thrive.Wednesday 17 August

The main event: The number of UK workers from eight eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 has passed one million for the first time. From April to June, workers from the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia increased by 44,000 compared to the same period in 2015. Official figures showed there were now a total of 2.23m EU workers in Britain. UK unemployment fell during the same three-month period.Also in the news: Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he wishes the UK had voted to remain in the EU as he faced renewed criticism of his role in the referendum campaign. "I did my best in that campaign," he insisted at a live BBC leadership hustings in front of party members. But one audience member said angrily: "David Cameron came across far more passionately than you ever did." However, another said he had been a Eurosceptic but Mr Corbyn persuaded him to vote Remain in June. Leadership rival Owen Smith said a deal reached in negotiations on leaving the EU should be "put back to the British people in a second referendum". And Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said it was "disgraceful" that the UK had not guaranteed the right of EU nationals to remain. She called for a guarantee as she hosted a question and answer session with hundreds of EU nationals, many of them concerned about whether they would have the right to live and work in Scotland when the UK leaves the EU.Financial news: Total UK unemployment dropped between April and June in the run-up to the Brexit vote, official figures indicate. The UK's jobless total fell by 52,000 to 1.64 million and the unemployment rate remained at 4.9%. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said that the UK economy showed "impressive resilience in the run-up to the EU referendum and the immediate aftermath of the vote to leave". However, he warned: "It is premature to draw any firm conclusions from this... It remains likely that softening economic activity and heightened uncertainty will take a toll on the labour market over the coming months." And for the first time in at least three years, British holidaymakers have found that a pound buys less than a euro at some bureaux de change.



From the papers: The Times says figures showing a record number of people from eastern Europe were employed in the UK "will heap pressure on Theresa May before formal Brexit negotiations begin". Its article adds: "The free movement of people within the EU is likely to be a central issue." Meanwhile the Daily Mail interprets comments by German minister Michael Roth as indicating "Britain will be given a 'special status' by the rest of the EU". EU officials have said access to the single market is conditional on states accepting freedom of movement of people but, while Mr Roth said there could not be "cherry-picking" by the UK, he added: "Given Britain's size, significance and its long membership of the European Union, there will probably be a special status which only bears limited comparison to that of countries that have never belonged to the European Union."Further reading:

And finally...Did Daphne du Maurier predict Brexit? Breaking apart from Europe, resentment towards Westminster elites, financial uncertainty - the author anticipated it all in her 1972 novel Rule Britannia. It imagines a future UK facing severe economic instability after joining and then leaving the EU's predecessor, the Common Market. The electorate has voted to leave in a referendum and the government has instead formed a new union with the United States. However, when the marines arrive on British soil, it begins to look like an invasion. Du Maurier also envisions a divided political nation, with London-based characters such as the prime minister and financiers showing support for union with the United States, while much of the rest of the country fiercely resists.Tuesday 16 August

The main event: A leading Vote Leave figure has said EU citizens in the UK have been "left in limbo" since the referendum. Labour MP Gisela Stuart is to head a cross-party inquiry, for the British Future think tank, which will examine what kind of legal status could be granted to EU citizens in the UK. Ms Stuart, former co-chair of the Vote Leave campaign, said the government should make clear "soon" that EU citizens in the UK - about three million people - will be allowed to stay after Brexit. Ministers have said it would be "unwise" to fully "guarantee" EU citizens' rights without a deal for Britons abroad.Also in the news: New Secretary of State James Brokenshire is on a fortnight's tour of Northern Ireland to canvass public opinion on the implications of Brexit. The Northern Ireland secretary said he hoped to spend August talking to business and community leaders and politicians, and would also meet groups representing victims and survivors of the Troubles. Mr Brokenshire said the UK was "a great and strong country with a bright future" and that Northern Ireland would have "a huge part to play" in that future. A majority of voters in Northern Ireland backed remaining in the EU and some politicians have voiced concerns about the implications for the land border with the Republic of Ireland.Financial news: UK inflation, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), rose to 0.6% in the year to July 2016, according to the Office for National Statistics. The price of goods bought and sold by UK manufacturers, the Producer Price Index, rose by 0.3% in the year to July 2016 following two years of falls. "There was no obvious impact on today's consumer prices figures following the EU referendum results, though the Producer Prices Index suggests the fall in the exchange rate is beginning to push up import prices faced by manufacturers," said Mike Prestwood, head of prices at the ONS. Meanwhile, the UK's benchmark share index fell in early trade, while the pound remained weak ahead of a big few days for economic statistics. Sterling has been under pressure as analysts wait for a string of key UK economic data due this week.

From the papers: The Guardian leads with coverage of a report from the Resolution Foundation which found, in the paper's words, that "damage to the economy caused by Brexit will more than offset the modest wage gains for British-born workers in low-paid jobs caused by cutting net migration to the tens of thousands a year". The Guardian says the think tank's report showed there "would be a small pay increase to native-born employees in sectors such as security and cleaning" but that "would fail to compensate" for higher inflation and an economic slowdown. The Daily Mail's comments section, however, says the report highlights "the negative effects of cheap foreign labour". It calls on the government "to implement a points system to control migration from within the EU without delay". And the Times reacts to the announcement on Monday that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is standing in for Theresa May this week: "Cripes! PM puts Johnson in charge for second half of holiday." After Mr Johnson abandoned his own leadership hopes after the EU referendum, he is now "not only politically rehabilitated but running the country", the Times adds.Further reading:

The main event: EU funding for farmers, scientists and other projects will be replaced by the Treasury after Brexit, Chancellor Philip Hammond has said. In a move which could cost up to £6bn a year, the Treasury announced that it would guarantee to back EU-funded projects signed before the chancellor's Autumn Statement later this year. Agricultural funding now provided by the EU will also continue until 2020. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell welcomed the weekend announcement but called on Mr Hammond to "speak up on the importance of keeping Britain's membership of the European Investment Bank". The Scottish government's Finance Minister, Derek Mackay, said the funding "leaves Scotland hundreds of millions of pounds short of what we would receive as members of the EU". And Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones said the guarantee only covers "about half" of regional funding for Wales.Also in the news: At a briefing for reporters, the prime minister's spokesman insisted that triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, starting the two-year process for the UK to leave the EU, "won't happen before the end of 2016" - even when asked whether it may or may not be triggered at any time in 2017. If the process does not begin in 2017, that could mean the UK does not actually leave the EU until 2020. The spokesman also said Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is the senior minister on duty in London this week, while Theresa May is on holiday in Switzerland, but he insisted the PM "is still very much in charge". Over the weekend, UKIP's Suzanne Evans told the BBC there was no need for the government to trigger Article 50, as it can bypass negotiations by transferring EU law into UK law. The government could then repeal the 1972 European Communities Act and "we'd be out as soon as Parliament voted on that", she claimed. She added that the person who wrote Article 50 "never thought it would be used" by an EU member state. And UKIP MEP Tim Aker told the Westminster Hour that, if the government does not put an end to free movement during Brexit negotiations, his party "wouldn't be able to print the membership forms quick enough for people to take them away".Financial news: Some employers are becoming increasingly concerned about the potential impact of Brexit on their migrant workforces. Ian Brinkley, chief economist at HR professional body the CIPD, told BBC Radio 4's Today that some bosses are taking steps such as helping their employees to apply for British citizenship. If Brexit does happen, employers will have to spend more on skills and training, he said - but some could face recruitment issues given the already low unemployment rate and difficulties in getting staff from domestic sources. The FTSE 100 was becalmed as trading got underway for another week at 6,917 points - just 1.7 points higher. And housebuilder Bovis Homes said it was too early to tell what the impact of the EU referendum on the housing market would be but the "underlying market fundamentals for UK housing remain positive".



From the papers: While Team GB's Olympics medal haul dominates the front pages, the Times reports that a holidaying Theresa May has intervened in a "turf war" between the senior minister in charge this week, Boris Johnson, and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox. The report follows a "leaked letter" obtained by the Sunday Telegraph. showing Dr Fox had "launched a power offensive" - in the Times' words - against Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson's department, suggesting the Foreign Office handle diplomacy and security but that promoting trade should belong to the Department for International Trade. However, Mr Johnson "robustly rejected the demands, it is understood". The PM created Dr Fox's department in the wake of the EU vote, also appointing David Davis as "Brexit secretary" - and the Times claims "civil servants fear that tensions will rise" between the two new departments and the Foreign Office. The PM's spokesman has said he "wasn't aware of" Mrs May having spoken to Mr Johnson or Dr Fox since the story of their row appeared.Further reading:

The main event: Wales should be allowed to borrow more money to prevent the economy suffering a Brexit "slowdown", Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has said. From April 2018, ministers in Cardiff Bay will have the power to borrow up to £500m of capital money to pay for infrastructure projects. Under an agreement with the UK government, that money will be available earlier if it is spent on the planned M4 relief road around Newport - but Ms Wood said there should be no restrictions on how the money is spent. A majority of voters in Wales backed leaving the EU in June's referendum.Also in the news: A victims campaigner in Northern Ireland has launched a legal challenge to Brexit. Raymond McCord, whose son was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries, is seeking a judicial review, arguing that it would be unlawful to begin the formal process of the UK leaving the EU without a parliamentary vote. His legal team also claim it could undermine the UK's treaty obligations under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and the peace process. It is the first challenge of its kind in Northern Ireland, though similar action is under way in England.Financial news: The CBI has said the UK's economic relationship with the United States needs "close care and attention" after the Brexit vote. With the details of the UK's future relationship with the EU - an important trading partner - far from clear, the business organisation said "the economic special relationship" between the US and the UK needs to be top of the list of government priorities. "The relationship between the US and UK is in incredibly good shape but we mustn't be complacent about it," said CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn. Meanwhile, James Rosener, president of the European American Chamber of Commerce in New York, said US companies are now thinking hard about future investments and London could lose out to Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin. "I think the general consensus is there won't be any mass movement but it will occur in stages," he said.

From the papers: At the Guardian, columnist Martin Kettle dismisses "chatter in Westminster" about the prospect of an early election. He argues that Theresa May will not call one, having said so when she launched her campaign to succeed David Cameron. He writes: "She said it because she meant it, and in part because the markets needed to hear her say it so soon after the Brexit vote." The piece follows former Conservative activist Tim Montgomerie's view in the Times on Thursday that the PM has "an open goal" if she went for an early poll. "Going to the country looks the safer option for the Tories and will also help the Labour Party by killing off Corbynism," he claimed.And finally...Anyone for an organogram? The government has unveiled the senior team at the new Department for Exiting the European Union. The department is responsible for negotiating the UK's exit and forging a new relationship with the EU. An organogram is a sort of professional family tree that shows the structure of an organisation in the form of a diagram. Heaven for politics and management geeks - if you can make sense of it.Thursday 11 August

The main event: The UK housing market paused for breath after the Brexit vote, but could take off again over the next 12 months, a poll of surveyors has suggested. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) survey showed house price rises slowed significantly in the three months to the end of July. However, the Rics survey suggests that house price inflation could resume its upward path within a year. A month ago - in the wake of the EU vote - surveyors were evenly divided about whether prices would rise or fall over the next 12 months. But any such growth is likely to be modest compared to 2015, or the start of 2016, when prices were rising by up to 10% a year.Also in the news: Theresa May is to take a summer holiday in Switzerland after her first month as prime minister, Number 10 has announced. Despite being in the heart of Europe, Switzerland is not an EU member or a member of the European Economic Area, but signed its first free trade agreement with the EU in 1972. It is currently embroiled in long-running talks with the EU over how to implement a 2014 referendum result in which the Swiss people backed limiting immigration through quotas, including EU citizens. But the PM has previously said she loves holidaying there because she can get some "peace and quiet".Financial news: While the FTSE 100 fell, shares in travel group TUI climbed as it reaffirmed profit forecasts despite a difficult year for the travel industry. The company - which includes Thomson and Hapag-Lloyd cruises - said there had been "no apparent slowdown" in UK bookings following the Brexit vote. TUI said it can charge more for countries such as Spain as demand shifts there from North Africa and Turkey.



From the papers: The Financial Times reports that a fall in yields from government bonds has led to fears that the UK pensions industry faces a funding crisis. The Bank of England launched a "£70bn bond-buying plan", the paper said, "to stimulate the economy amid fears of a Brexit-related slowdown" which has pushed up prices and cut returns for investors. Pension funds invest heavily in government bonds and "the accelerating collapse of yields has widened already substantial gaps in many big pension funds". The FT also reports on the return of "some optimism" to the housing market. The Telegraph, meanwhile, noted that "Theresa May is following in the footsteps of the late Baroness Thatcher" by holidaying in Switzerland. "The late Baroness Thatcher holidayed in Switzerland several times during her premiership with the retired Tory MP Sir Douglas Glover and his wife Eleanor at their lakeside home in Schloss Freudenberg," the paper reported.More reading:

An Ulster Unionist MLA has bitten back at Northern Ireland's first minister after she compared him to a "Chihuahua" in a verbal dog fight over Brexit. Arlene Foster campaigned for Brexit but the UUP accused her of a "U-turn" after she signed a joint letter to the prime minister outlining several concerns. Mrs Foster said the UUP had set up MLA Steven Aiken as its "attack dog" but claimed he was more like a Chihuahua. He snapped back that Chihuahuas were "small but intelligent and ferocious".Wednesday 10 August

The main event: The cost to the UK of leaving the European Union without negotiating a replacement trade deal has been highlighted in a new report. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said that if the UK failed to negotiate any new trade arrangements, the cost could be the equivalent of 4% of economic output. The government has yet to start negotiating the UK's departure from the EU following the vote to leave in June. Ian Mitchell, IFS research associate and co-author of the report, said: "From an economic point of view we still face some very big choices indeed in terms of our future relationship with the EU. There is all the difference in the world between 'access to' and 'membership of' the single market. Membership is likely to offer significant economic benefits, particularly for trade in services."Also in the news: Nicola Sturgeon has announced £100m of extra funding to boost Scotland's economy and support businesses in the wake of the UK's vote to leave the EU. The Scottish government is to create extra support for job-creating projects and arrangements to help businesses deal with uncertainty. Ms Sturgeon has also called for the UK government to help boost the economy. The UK government's Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, is also to hold talks with business leaders and youth groups about Brexit - and has said he will work closely with the Scottish government. And a former adviser to the Welsh government has said Wales needs a dedicated minister for Brexit to co-ordinate its response to leaving the EU. Economist Gerry Holtham said plans to appoint an advisory group of business leaders and experts were "probably not sufficient".Financial news: The Bank of England has stumbled in its post-Brexit economic stimulus plans after it failed to find enough sellers for new bond buying programme. It fell £52m short of its £1.17bn target to buy long-dated government debt, which has driven up prices and pushed down the return to investors. Printing money to buy up government bonds is a key plank in the Bank's plans to boost the economy, along with a cut in interest rates to a record low of 0.25%. In a statement, the Bank said it will make up the shortfall in the second half of the year, with details of exactly when to be announced in November. Meanwhile, a post-referendum fall in sterling has left the Ministry of Defence facing extra costs of up to £700m a year, say defence experts. The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) says the increased costs are due to military equipment purchases made in US dollars.



From the papers: "Britain could be up to £70bn worse off if it leaves the single market after Brexit because of slower growth," is the Telegraph's take on the IFS report. The article adds that EU leaders "have warned that Britain cannot remain a full member of the single market without agreeing to the free movement of EU migrants". The Times reports that "the value of the pound fell to its lowest level in a month" following a widening of the UK's trade deficit and warnings of more quantitative easing. The Express, meanwhile, says the UK adopting the so-called "Norwegian model" of single market membership outside the EU could be blocked by Norway itself. "Oslo has said it may throw a huge spanner in the works by vetoing any future UK membership of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) over fears such a large country would dominate the small group," the paper claims, However, it also quotes the leader of Norway's Socialist Left party arguing that the UK could help secure a better deal for countries including Norway. The Guardian has an extract from a new book by US economist Joseph Stiglitz, who argues that the EU's problems are chiefly the fault of the euro, which needs to be "radically rethought". Mr Stiglitz writes: "While there are many factors contributing to Europe's travails, there is one underlying mistake: the creation of the single currency, the euro. Or, more precisely, the creation of a single currency without establishing a set of institutions that enabled a region of Europe's diversity to function effectively."More reading:

Do your favourite brands show how divided Brexit Britain is? Many attempts have been made to analyse the views and motives of Leave and Remain voters, but new analysis has looked at their consumer preferences. It suggests there are other profound cultural differences between the two sides beyond their attitude to the EU. Researchers looked at the data gathered by the polling organisation YouGov and have drawn up lists of the brands which are most highly regarded or used by Leave and Remain voters. The resulting Top 10 lists of brands most favoured by each set of voters were revealed in an article in the advertising trade paper Campaign. Top brands for Leave voters include HP sauce, Bisto, Birds Eye, PG Tips and ITV News. The Top 10 for Remain voters includes Instagram, Spotify, LinkedIn and, erm... the BBC website.Tuesday 9 August

The main event: British retailers sold more in July than in the same month last year, defying predictions of a post-Brexit slump. Total sales increased by 1.9%, according to the British Retail Consortium and KPMG's latest survey. David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG, said warmer weather had "boosted the UK feel-good factor and gave consumers a sense that 'life goes on' following the initial shock of the Brexit vote". Also in the news: Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones is putting together an advisory group of business leaders and experts on Europe to help ministers understand the "real world impact" on Welsh communities, companies and public services. At the same time Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies predicted a surplus for Wales after the UK leaves the EU, and accused Labour of "wallowing in self-pity". Financial news: The Office for National Statistics released figures showing that the UK's manufacturing industry picked up pace in June as the sector showed signs of recovery in the run up to Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Manufacturing output fell by 0.3%, stepping up from a 0.6% drop in May, but below the 0.0% expected by economists. "Very few" respondents reported an impact from the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote, the Office for National Statistics said. The pound was trading near a one-month low as manufacturing failed to meet expectations and the Bank of England's Ian McCafferty suggested more quantitative easing may be needed if the UK's economic decline worsens.



From the papers: In The Times, the Bank of England's Ian McCafferty writes that "after the Brexit vote the growth outlook deteriorated sharply" and if the economy continues to turn down "more easing is likely to be required". The same paper reports that Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, believes that Brexit will force the government to raise borrowing by £60bn. After yesterday's story that more tourists are coming to Britain in the wake of the referendum, the Daily Mirror points out the fall in sterling means a "pounding for Brit tourists' holiday money". Max Hastings writes in the Daily Mail that the UK needs a "migration minister" to ensure promises made during the campaign on controlling migration are kept. In the Guardian, a former EU ambassador to the World Trade Organisation predicts the UK could negotiate an EU trade deal within two years, contrary to what some European leaders have said.

The main event: Scottish Secretary David Mundell has announced talks with key sectors in Scotland - including farming, oil and gas - on the impact of leaving the European Union. Mr Mundell said he wants to ensure Scottish interests are "at the heart" of Brexit negotiations. Last month First Minister Nicola Sturgeon detailed a number of areas she wants to protect as the process gets started, emphasising that a second referendum remains "highly likely". Mr Mundell has promised to work closely with her government.Also in the news: Flight bookings to the UK have jumped since June, driven by a sharp fall in the pound. The think tank Policy Exchange has recommended that every British citizen should be given a unique "person number" in a register of the national population to help ease fears over immigration in the wake of the referendum - but the Lib Dems have criticised the idea as "ID cards by the back door". And the TUC has issued a call for zero tolerance on racism in the workplace, saying firms should set up systems so workers could report discrimination or abuse. Financial news: UK consumer spending picked up in July, according to a survey from credit card company Visa UK which contrasts with other signs that Britons have become more cautious since the referendum. The latest business confidence survey from BDO showed optimism at a three-year low, but that the fall in sentiment after the Brexit vote was less than expected. Peter Hemington, of BDO LLP, said: "Brexit has compounded the continuing slowdown of the UK economy, but there is opportunity as well as challenge ahead for UK businesses.



From the papers: The Times carries some comments by Iain Duncan Smith, who warns that Leave voters will not support a "Brexit-lite" option, and rubbishes the idea that the House of Lords could block activation of Article 50, the formal mechanism that will take Britain out of the EU. In the same paper, there's a report that Brexit Secretary David Davis is fighting to prevent his department being relocated from Downing Street to Whitehall, apparently believing it to be "too far from the centre of power". The Sun observes that the Queen's former communications secretary, James Roscoe, has been appointed an adviser to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, and the Daily Mail features former minister Anna Soubry's opinion that the Remain campaign made a "terrible mistake" in not taking immigration concerns seriously enough. The Financial Times has a post-mortem of most pollsters' failure to accurately predict the outcome of the EU referendum, with several commentators of the view that polling companies may have got "caught up in the political zeitgeist".More reading:

Media captionBank of England deputy Ben Broadbent says it is "likely" interest rates will be cut again
The main event: The Bank of England deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, told the BBC's Today programme there could be a further interest rate cut this year if the economy worsens, following Thursday's cut from 0.5% to 0.25%. Mr Broadbent said the Bank had acted after a series of surveys since the referendum on most aspects of the economy, including employment, the housing market and business confidence, which had turned down markedly.Also in the news: The referendum was also a point of conflict in last night's Labour leadership hustings, with challenger Owen Smith sticking to his promise of a second referendum and Jeremy Corbyn saying he accepted that the "majority of people, sadly, did vote to leave" the EU and the party "has to win those people back". IHS Markit's monthly jobs report suggests the number of people in the UK securing a permanent job has fallen for two months in a row, with participants citing uncertainty caused by Brexit, although the group which sponsors the survey predicted confidence could return to employers as the political situation stabilises. The chief executive of Renault-Nissan has told the BBC he is "reasonably optimistic" that the UK will be an important partner with the EU, despite its vote to leave. Financial news: The FTSE 100 has erased earlier gains to be flat at 6,741 - not helped by a 6% slide in RBS shares. That was after an earlier jump to its highest level in a year this morning as investors welcomed the Bank of England's new stimulus package. 



From the papers: The Financial Times is considering the consequences of yesterday's rate cut, saying that business is "split" over the decision - some industry representatives welcoming it and others predicting it won't have much impact. The Times looks at a poll by Ipsos MORI suggesting the French will be the "least sad" to see the UK leave the EU and that many Italians are planning to stop buying British goods. In the Guardian, there's a feature on the impact of the referendum on the Edinburgh festival, reporting some comedians have had to rewrite their acts as it would be "odd not to talk about Brexit".

The main event: The Bank of England has cut UK interest rates for the first time since March 2009 from 0.5% to 0.25% - an historic low. It also launched two new schemes: one to buy £10bn of high-grade corporate bonds and another - potentially worth up to £100bn - to ensure banks keep lending even after the cut in interest rates. The Bank faced increasing pressure to act after recent poor economic data. The rate cut is intended to boost the UK economy in the wake of the country's vote to leave the EU - but some analysts see it as a "wasted gesture", saying the main shock from the Brexit vote is "political" and difficult to address through monetary policy.Also in the news: The National Trust is calling for an overhaul of agricultural subsidies after Brexit, saying farmers should only be paid public subsidies for managing the countryside in a wildlife-friendly way - an idea which has been given short shrift by the National Farmers' Union.

Financial news: All eyes are on the Bank of England's decision to cut interest rates - which saw the value of the pound fall more than 1% against the dollar. The Bank has left its forecast for growth this year steady at 2% but 2017 brings a sharp downgrade to growth of just 0.8%, from a previous estimate of 2.3%. The Bank says the outlook has "weakened markedly" following the referendum vote. From the papers: The Guardian carries a warning that leaving the EU could "kill off" fruit and vegetable production if foreign workers are prevented from coming to the UK. The Financial Times reports pension funds are worried by a new round of quantitative easing, which is part of the steps announced by Bank of England to offset a slowdown in growth following the Brexit vote. An editorial in the Telegraph argues that UKIP needs to "face up to its responsibilities" and ensure the party is in a position to play an active role in the process by which the UK leaves the EU. And The Times' science correspondent sees tough decisions ahead for Environment Secretary Andrea Leadsom, as the powers the UK will regain over farming could "make or break" agriculture.

The main event: UKIP, which is looking for a new leader to succeed Nigel Farage, published a list of the candidates that are eligible to stand in the contest. There was immediate controversy after MEP Steven Woolfe, regarded as the frontrunner, was disqualified after he missed the deadline for submitting his application by 17 minutes. Contenders who are going forward after being vetted by UKIP's NEC are: MEPs Diane James, Jonathan Arnott and Bill Etheridge, councillor Lisa Duffy and former parliamentary candidates Elizabeth Jones and Phillip Broughton.Also in the news: Experts at the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford have been looking at the existing system for EU migrants applying for permanent residence in the UK to examine possible issues that could arise if it was altered following the Brexit vote. They suggest if all the three million European Economic Area (EEA) citizens living in the UK at the beginning of 2016 applied for permanent residence in the same year, this would amount to the equivalent of about 140 years of work at recent rates of processing.Financial news: Activity in the services sector saw its sharpest fall in seven years in July, according to the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index. Meanwhile, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research is arguing the UK has a 50/50 chance of falling into recession within the next 18 months. The think tank says the country will go through a "marked economic slowdown" this year and next as a "short-term consequence" of the decision to leave the EU. However, its forecasts still suggest the UK will avoid recession, the economy growing by 1.7% in 2016 and 1% in 2017. The FTSE 100 opened at 6630.13 - down slightly on the previous day, but still close to its year high. Meanwhile, the pound was at 1.19 euros (its 52 week high is 1.43 euros, its post Brexit low was 1.16 euros). From the papers: The Guardian says charities fear Brexit will increase demand for their services but imperil their funding. According to the Daily Telegraph, as many as 2,000 farmers have been left in limbo after a string of multi-million grant schemes for the countryside were frozen after the Brexit vote. The Times reports that investors used fears over Brexit to withdraw £3.5bn from UK managed investment funds in June, dwarfing the worst month in the 2008 financial crisis. The Sun says Tory MPs and MEPs are rallying behind its campaign to axe the UK's burgundy passports and reinstate the previous British navy passport design. More reading:

Brexit spelled the end of David Cameron's leadership but now the ex-prime minister appears to have suffered a further indignity - his waxwork image has been removed from display by Madame Tussauds in London. The figure will be kept in storage and will not be immediately replaced by Theresa May in front of its Downing Street display. A spokeswoman told the Mirror its policy was not to display figures of leaders that have not been elected by the public - although it may review this in future. Tuesday 2 August

                    Sir Julian King was nominated to replace Lord Hill by former PM David Cameron
                

The main event: The UK has a new European Commissioner following the resignation of Lord Hill of Oareford, who quit as financial services commissioner after the Brexit vote. Sir Julian King, a career civil servant and former ambassador to France, will spearhead EU co-operation on terrorism, organised crime and cyber-security. It's being seen as a higher-profile role than that which was expected to be conferred on the UK following the decision to leave the EU, and could give an indication of how the Commission sees the future of the UK's cooperation with EU member states. Also in the news: Theresa May's new cabinet subcommittee met to hold its first talks on how to strengthen the economy in light of the UK's vote to leave the EU. The prime minister has billed it as underlining the importance of "building on the strong fundamentals of the British economy and ensuring that everyone who works hard is able to enjoy wage growth, job security and opportunities to progress". The UK's net contribution to the EU rose last year to almost £200m a week, according to the Office for National Statistics.Financial news: The UK's construction industry suffered its sharpest downturn in seven years last month, according to a business survey that suggests the economy is at risk of recession after the Brexit vote. The Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inched down to 45.9 in July from 46.0 in June - the lowest reading since June 2009 and some way below the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction. While better than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that pointed to a reading of 43.8, the figures - compiled after the referendum - show commercial construction dwindled and confidence flagged.  



From the papers: The Financial Times is predicting that pensions for British officials working in Brussels "are set to be one of the most poisonous parts of Brexit talks", pointing out the typical employee of the EU institutions is entitled to a pension of up to 70% of their basic salary. The Daily Mail has more on Monday's story about peers considering moves to delay Brexit, saying No 10 has "slapped down" the idea and the peer who made the suggestion "thinks she knows better than voters". Writing in the Telegraph, former Labour MP Alan Milburn describes the Brexit vote as "a demand from voters for more social mobility". The Guardian has a feature on the impact of the referendum on academic research, which includes the claim from one scientist that EU colleagues are "worried" about collaborating with their British counterparts.More reading:

                    Several prominent Remain figures have reportedly been recommended for honours
                

The main event: The Sunday Times has published details of what it claims is David Cameron's resignation honours list - including prominent Remain campaigners such as Will Straw, head of Stronger In, Tory and Remain campaign donors Ian Taylor and Andrew Cook, and Cabinet ministers Philip Hammond, Michael Fallon, Patrick McLoughlin, and David Lidington. Outgoing UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the list amounted to "rewards for failure", but recently knighted Conservative MP Sir Desmond Swayne said it was right to recognise those who "deserve a little bit more of a thank you than their salary".Also in the news: A Conservative peer, Baroness Wheatcroft, has raised the idea that a cross-party coalition of Lords could delay or block Article 50, the mechanism for leaving the EU, if Parliament is asked to approve it. And the BBC caught up with fishermen who were part of a pro-Brexit flotilla during the referendum campaign.Financial news:  The UK's manufacturing sector activity fell in July, a survey by Markit/CIPS suggests. The measure of output and new orders fell below the 50 mark that denotes growth for the first time since early 2013. Some analysts have interpreted as evidence that the vote to leave the EU "has added to pressures on the sector", with others advising "it will take time to really understand" the true implications of the decision. Those manufacturing figures sent the pound down 0.2% to $1.32. It had been up 0.1% until the release of the index, and the measure is now at its lowest level since February 2013.



From the papers: Several papers are looking ahead to the meeting of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee on 4 August, with The Guardian talking about a cut in interest rates to 0.25% in an attempt to offset uncertainty associated with the vote to leave the EU and The Financial Times predicting the Bank will downgrade its growth forecast. But The Daily Mail accuses experts of being "doom-mongers" who have "forgotten all the good news".More reading:

But a spokesman for Mr Juncker today refused to divulge details to BBC political reporter Adam Fleming, saying: "You will have to ask him if the BBC is in it."Friday 29 July The main event: All eyes are on the surprise delay in the Hinkley Point C agreement, which is only Brexit-related insofar as the referendum ushered in a change of prime minister. Also in the news:  Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways owner IAG, has played down the impact of the UK's vote to leave the EU, saying he firmly believed "business will settle down" in the wake of the referendum. That's despite BA and IAG reporting that currency movements cost it €148m (£124m) in the latest quarter of trading, mainly due to the weak pound. High-profile London estate agency Foxtons has announced a 42% fall in profits, blaming uncertainty around the EU referendum for the fall. Earlier this week the UK's biggest building society, the Nationwide, said that the Brexit effect on the property market and house prices could take months to become clear. Following a written question from Conservative Lord Blencathra asking if UK passports will be changed from maroon to blue and remove the words "European Union" from the cover, the Home Office has said "there are no immediate plans" to alter its appearance.Financial news: The FTSE 100 closed at 6,724 - up just 3 points, helped by strong trade in shares in financial companies. Growth in the eurozone slowed in the second quarter to 0.3%, official EU data showed on Friday, with analysts warning that the consequences of Brexit could harm the economy later in the year. 



From the papers: The Guardian reports Ford is considering closing factories and raising prices in the UK. The Financial Times gives top billing to its analysis that the referendum is creating a stark divide between "winners and losers", with exporters and producers of essentials seeing a lift, and importers and discretionary spending hit. The Daily Mail is critical of Lloyds' chief executive Antonio Horta Osario's warning that Brexit could slow growth - saying it was "entirely unconnected" to the job losses announced on Thursday. In the Telegraph, Allister Heath writes of the need to "energise our economy", recommending the halving of stamp duty, a green light to airport expansion and tax cuts for entrepreneurs. And in The Times, Ed Conway foresees a "Brexit lobbying boom", warning that it will take a "superhuman effort" not to let big business rule the roost. More reading:

                    Theresa May with Polish PM Beata Szydlo
                

The main event: Theresa May embarked on the next leg of her European tour, taking in Bratislava and Warsaw. Her discussions with Slovakian counterpart Robert Fico and Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo are among the toughest she has had yet, given the priority attached by the two countries to maintaining free movement of labour between the EU and the UK. Since Poland joined the EU in 2004, hundred of thousands have moved to Britain, either temporarily or permanently, and Poles in the UK send back several billion pounds a year to their home country. Mrs May maintained any future deal would have to take into account "a clear message" from the Brexit vote over immigration control.  Lloyds axes 3,000 jobs: Lloyds has announced it will cut 3,000 jobs and 200 branches - partly due to changes in the way people carry out their banking, but also in expectation of a "deceleration of growth" following the UK's decision to leave the EU. That sounds like it might be what some are calling a #Brexcuse - blaming bad news on the EU referendum result.

Also in the news: Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is in Paris meeting French foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault. Relations between the two have not been exactly cordial so far, with Mr Ayrault criticising the appointment of his opposite number on the grounds he "lied" during the referendum campaign. Although the technicalities of the Brexit process are not officially part of Mr Johnson's portfolio - he said he hopes the UK will "be as close as possible to" France after the vote to leave the EU and that the two would work together "as friends and allies".Financial news: The FTSE 100 closed 0.4% lower at 6,721, hurt by a 4% fall in shares in Lloyds Banking Group. Lloyds' shares dipped with the news it is cutting jobs, partly in anticipation of slower growth after the Brexit vote,  while Sky's shares were up 6%, with group chief executive Jeremy Darroch saying the Brexit vote "doesn't really change our thinking on any of our markets". The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) says UK car production jumped more than 10% year-on-year in June, but warns future growth may be hit if the government does not maintain unrestricted access to the single market. One index of consumer confidence measured by YouGov for the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) sank nearly five points to 106.6 in July - matching its biggest fall in six years. YouGov said the "public is still absorbing" the EU referendum result but it is "clear that consumer confidence has taken a significant dive".



From the papers: The Times warns against "self-fulfilling prophecies of doom" on the economy, pointing out that the picture going into Brexit was one of "unusually good health". Writing in the Telegraph, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard says the age of fiscal restraint is over, and governments in Europe and beyond are using Brexit as an "excuse" to let rip with stimulus measures. The Financial Times reports that European executives in the UK and EU-based British businesspeople are being offered "Brexit insurance" by the firm AIG. And the Daily Mail takes a dim view of the new lead Brexit negotiator for the European Commission Michel Barnier, calling him an "inflexible, anti-British, arch-federalist" whose appointment was "calculated to poison talks" with the UK.

And finally...Boris Johnson addressed the French foreign ministry En Francais, and made a decent fist of it. That may stand him in good stead later on, since the Times reports that Michel Barnier "insists on conducting all his negotiations in French". Still, it could be worse. Paul Cambon, French ambassador in London 1898-1920, is described in Christopher Clark's book The Sleepwalkers:  "[He] spoke not a word of English. During his meetings with [Foreign Secretary] Edward Grey (who spoke no French), he insisted every utterance be translated into French, including easily recognized words such as 'yes'.  He firmly believed - like many members of the French elite - that French was the only language capable of articulating rational thought."

The main event: Prime Minister Theresa May has continued her series of meetings with other EU leaders, heading to Italy for talks with PM Matteo Renzi. There, she said she retained an "open mind" about the UK's trading relationships after Brexit amid reports some cabinet colleagues want the UK to pull out of the EU's customs union. Mr Renzi said the UK's vote to leave the EU was sad, but he hoped "some good would come of it". Mrs May's visit follows Downing Street talks on Tuesday with Enda Kenny and last week's meetings with Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande.EC names Brexit negotiator: Michel Barnier, a former French minister and ex-European Commission vice president, has been appointed as the commission's chief Brexit negotiator, by Jean-Claude Juncker. Mr Juncker said he wanted "an experienced politician for this difficult job". Mr Barnier will take up his position on 1 October. He will not necessarily be the European Union's chief negotiator as the European Council looks set to head-up negotiations, with Belgian diplomat Didier Seeuws leading their preparations, while the European Parliament will also seek to take the lead at some stages.Also in the news: MPs on the Home Affairs committee warn in a report that there could be a spike in migration ahead of Brexit. They call for the government to give an "effective cut-off date" after which EU citizens moving to the UK do not have the automatic right to stay. The "most obvious" cut-off dates they suggest include the referendum day itself - June 23 - the date when the UK triggers the two year Article 50 process of leaving the EU, which will be early 2017 at the earliest, or the date when the UK actually leaves the EU.Financial news: Lots today. The Office for National Statistics released economic growth figures for the second quarter of the year. They show that growth was 0.6%, higher than 0.4% in the first quarter, and higher than expected. The figures appear to show uncertainty ahead of the referendum had "limited", if any, impact on growth. Meanwhile GlaxoSmithKline is to invest £275m to expand its UK manufacturing sites, saying the country remains "an attractive location" despite Brexit. The news is particularly interesting given the firm had warned ahead of the referendum of the impact a Brexit vote would have. The FTSE 100 index was up slightly on the GDP news, to 6749.12 at 16:00 BST, so once again nudging its high point of the last year. The pound was at 1.19 euros (its 52 week high is 1.43 euros, its post Brexit low was 1.16 euros). From the papers



The Financial Times leads on International Trade Secretary Liam Fox wanting the UK to quit the EU customs union so that he has maximum freedom to negotiate new trade deals around the world - the FT quotes him as saying he was "scoping out about a dozen free trade deals outside the EU to be ready for when we leave". The Daily Telegraph says that Brexit could lead to BT being broken up because regulator Ofcom would have more powers.  More reading:

The main event: There are no answers yet on what will happen to the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland when the UK leaves the EU, but diplomatic overtures continue with Theresa May hosting Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny at Downing Street. She said they were in agreement that Ireland and the UK "want to maintain the closest possible economic relationship". Mr Kenny said Brexit "was not the outcome we in Ireland wanted" but expressed hope the UK would remain "outward-looking". Also in the news: There were widespread calls for action in June after figures showed a rise in reported racist incidents following the referendum - and now Home Secretary Amber Rudd has announced a review of how the police handle hate crime. Another consequence of the Brexit vote was Nigel Farage's decision to step down as UKIP leader. The contest to succeed him showed signs of livening up, with Suzanne Evans ruling herself out with a pledge to back councillor Lisa Duffy - and MEP Steven Woolfe heading to Manchester for his first big speech.Financial news: No relevant financial data released. London's FTSE 100 index ended almost 14 points higher at 6,724.7 - well up on its immediate post-referendum level and approaching its highest of the past year. The FTSE 250 was up to 17,108, about 13% above its June low and back to average levels for the past year. Most papers carry the news that Ryanair plans to "pivot" investment away from the UK by cutting frequency of flights on some routes.From the papers



Martin Weale from the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee, the MPC, has spoken out in favour of a stimulus package - which, according to the Financial Times, "all but guarantees" the bank will announce one at its meeting on 4 August.Forget any "emergency Budget" - the new chancellor is unlikely to make a significant announcement until November, as it will be difficult to read the economic runes cast by the referendum before then, advises Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies in The Times. The Daily Telegraph and others report on the views of the president of the Royal Society, Sir Venki Ramakrishnan, who says he has seen no evidence UK researchers are being overlooked for EU funding in the wake of the referendum, and the UK's attractiveness to international academics is "not going to change". Reuters reports Liam Fox, the new international trade minister, got a lukewarm reception in Washington DC, where US counterpart Michael Froman warned of no "meaningful advance" US-UK trade negotiations until "basic issues around the future EU-UK relationship have been worked out".More reading:

Monday 25 JulyThe main event: Theresa May paid her first visit to Northern Ireland as prime minister, where she met First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness to discuss issues facing the country following the referendum result. She said their talks were "positive and constructive". The key issue was what happens to the border between Northern Ireland the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. Mrs May said: "No-one wants to return to borders of the past."

                    At a speech in Edinburgh Nicola Sturgeon called the lack of planning for the eventuality of a Brexit vote "one of the most shameful abdications of responsibility in modern political history"
                

Financial news: London's main share index was lower on Monday morning, while other major European markets saw gains. Shares had been in positive territory until publication of the CBI's latest industrial trends survey, which suggested Brexit was hitting business confidence. The Financial Times reported that billions of euros have been pulled out of investment funds since the UK voted to leave the EU, although some analysts say this could just be an initial knee-jerk response. From the papers: What the commentators say: Roger Bootle of Capital Economics, writing in the Telegraph, is bullish about the UK's financial outlook, saying "alarmist views have proved unjustified" - with the equity market "stabilised" and the fall of sterling "of net benefit to the economy overall". Ian King in the Times asks whether Philip Hammond's courtship of Chinese investment could create the potential for clashes at Downing Street, saying Theresa May has been far more "sceptical" about inviting Chinese involvement in UK projects. The Guardian's Larry Elliott assesses some options for an "economic reboot", including quantitative easing or loosening credit controls - "something governments need to have up their sleeves when time gets tough".And finally... EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker on Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who once compared the EU to Nazis: "I haven't met him, but I would love to, so that I can persuade him that there is more separating myself and Hitler than just a nuance."

                    In its heyday, Lossiemouth harbour was home to 90 working fishing boats
                

What do the prospects of Brexit mean for Scotland's Eurosceptic nationalists? In the harbour at Lossiemouth, you can still see signs of its fishing industry - the buildings that housed a daily fish market, the two basins once packed with up to 90 working boats. These days, it is mostly pleasure boats in the harbour and visitors enjoying the sandbanks or sheltering from the brisk wind in the cafes that cater for tourists to this beautiful, if bleak, stretch of coastline.John Thomson has no doubt what is to blame for the sorry state of his former industry, one which used to employ 500 people in the town  - the Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union. So far, so predictable - it is a story I've heard from fishermen and their families many times, in the south-west of England and now here on Scotland's north-east coast. What is different, though, is that Mr Thomson, who first fished these waters more than 60 years ago and is a lifelong Scottish Nationalist, is delighted at the prospect of Brexit."There's people going about in high office still trying to reverse that decision," he says. "Well, they had better not try."We are used to thinking of the SNP as a pro-EU party.  Its leading figures campaigned for Remain in June's referendum, and it is true that Scotland, where 62% voted to stay, is the most pro-European nation in the UK.

                    Former SNP leader Gordon Wilson says the party has always had Eurosceptic members
                

Yet as Gordon Wilson, who led the party for just over a decade, told me on The World This Weekend earlier this year, the SNP has a strand of Euroscepticism in its make-up."Back in the 1970s, they were strongly anti-European," says Pro Michael Keating, from the University of Aberdeen, who is director of the Centre on Constitutional Change.The SNP was in favour of leaving Europe in the 1975 referendum.Partly, Prof Keating says, this was to do with fishing and farming, but there was a more fundamental argument, one to do with the philosophy of nationalism."What is the point in getting out of the UK if you're going to give your sovereignty over to Brussels instead?" he says.The official position shifted in the 1980s, but in Moray, of which Lossiemouth is part, you will find SNP members who still hold to that view. Voters, too, judging by the referendum result. In Moray, the Remain campaign prevailed only by the narrowest of margins, 122 votes. Paul Briggs was among the Leave campaigners. He is a former SNP press officer, though insists he came under no pressure to conform to his party's prevailing pro-Europe position. When I ask him how he feels about First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's determination to keep Scotland in the EU, he grins broadly."I think there's more to this than meets the eye," he says. "It's all about getting Scottish independence, that's the way of going forward to open the gates of Scottish independence."

                    North East Fife MP Stephen Gethins says Nicola Sturgeon's support for the EU is genuine
                

The implication is pro-EU rhetoric is more about creating a justification for a second referendum on independence than an abiding passion for Brussels.Stephen Gethins, MP for North East Fife, denies this. The party's spokesman on the EU at Westminster, he says the commitment to remaining is genuine, because "the EU is a club for independent, sovereign nation states".How does he answer people such as Mr Briggs and Mr Thomson, members and supporters of the SNP, who think the European Union has done real harm here, especially to the fishing industry?"When we entered the European Union," he says, as he acknowledges the failure of the Common Fisheries Policy, "it was the UK that referred to the Scottish fishing industry as being 'expendable'."When I query his reference, he tells me it is to be found in files released under the 30-year rule.Mr Gethins argues that because two-thirds of the industry was in Scotland, the Westminster government had delivered a particularly poor deal for his part of the country when it negotiated membership in 1972.

                    In the EU referendum, Scotland was the most pro-European nation in the UK
                

Back in Lossiemouth, I ask Mr Thomson if there was a second referendum and the choice was to remain in a United Kingdom leaving the European Union or an independent Scotland remaining inside the EU, which he would vote for?"The former," he replies, adding it is a "very hard, very hard thing to say". "I've worked and stood, represented in many ways, for the Scottish National Party - but equally for the fishing industry," he says.He simply cannot stomach supporting Scottish membership of an organisation he blames for the loss of what was Lossiemouth's principal livelihood. It may be that Scottish voters do not have very long to wait before they face that dilemma themselves.Shaun Ley presents The World This Weekend this summer, on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 13:00, and available afterwards on the BBC iPlayer.

                    The value of the subisidies British farmers get depend on the pound-euro exchange rate
                

You might think the most important thing happening in the UK farming industry is the summer harvest.But as the fields of wheat and barley are brought in for the winter, farmers will have their eye on something other than the weather."The exchange rate between the pound and the euro is absolutely vital. It is the single biggest determinant of the profitability of British farming," says Anand Dossa, economist at the National Farmers Union.The average exchange rate between the euro and the pound in September will determine how much money UK farmers get from the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) - the source of more than half of UK farming's income last year.CAP payments are set in euros, so what British farmers get depends on the exchange rate; last year they got the worst rate in eight years.Since the EU referendum the pound has fallen to 30-year lows against the dollar and has weakened significantly against the euro.This means there could be a 15% increase in farmers' EU subsidies once they're converted into sterling - about an extra £500m.Competitive edgeHowever, the weaker pound can make fuel, fertiliser and food for animals more expensive, but there is some evidence that in some areas it has already given a boost to UK produce, both at home and abroad.

                    Irish beef imports have now become more expensive in the UK due to the weaker pound
                

 Foreign-sourced food has now risen in price compared to home-grown produce, and UK farmers have gained a competitive edge when selling overseas.Richard King, head of business research at The Andersons Centre, a farming business consultancy, explains: "The UK beef sector, say, sees a lot of imports from Ireland - suddenly they're more expensive. "So that just allows our prices internally to rise. But if you're exporting wheat to Spain, for example, our grain looks cheaper. It is noticeable out there already."That leaves some thinking we've voted and we have a better situation - but of course it is only a short-term boost."
The UK government has said it will make sure farmers don't lose out on subsidies until at least 2020 as the UK negotiates a deal to leave the European Union.As well as subsidies, the UK's trading relationship with the bloc is vital."Farming is probably more international than people realise," says Mr King."There's a mental image of a farmer leaning on his gate with a bit of straw hanging out of his mouth but these are businesses and once the goods get through the farm gate they are commodities that are traded internationally like anything else. "Grain is traded in the same way as iron ore, steel, coal."Trading relationshipsThe UK exported £18bn of food and drink last year and imported £38.5bn worth. Its biggest trading partners were Ireland, France, the Netherlands and the USA."You can trade with the French as easily as you can between the north and south of England and that's almost as good as it can be," says Mr King.
The boost from the fall in the pound, both through prices and EU subsidies, was much needed, say many farmers.Prices have been falling for almost three years in the UK. The latest data from the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) shows they are almost back to 2010 levels.The NFU says many family farms in the UK "would not be viable" without state support.Defra, a department that is now headed by Andrea Leadsom, a prominent pro-Brexit campaigner, says support for farmers will form "an important part" of the UK's exit from the EU.In a statement it said: "We will work to ensure the best possible outcome for the British people; not least our farming community who play a vital role in our country."

                    Many family farms in the UK "would not be viable" without state support, says the NFU
                

Daniel Rosario, spokesman for agriculture at the European Commission, says: "The UK remains a member of the EU with all rights and obligations of a member state. "For the time being, nothing changes."As far as the harvest goes, this year's winter barley crop was hit by bad weather in June in the run up to the EU referendum.  But the crops sown in the spring had the best of a heat wave in July, so the later harvest is looking much better."I think farmers are a pretty resilient bunch," says Mr King."Farming has been through a lot before - foot and mouth, floods, you name it - and they will get through this too."

In her first major policy speech one of the people incoming Prime Minister Theresa May name checked raised more than a few eyebrows. After the customary references to Margaret Thatcher and Robert Peel, she mentioned someone not usually held up in the pantheon of Tory pin-ups - the great Birmingham political figure, Joseph Chamberlain. Perhaps we shouldn't have been too surprised, her co-chief of staff and most trusted adviser Nick Timothy (a Brummie), is known to be an enormous fan. So much so, he wrote a book about him.But who was Joseph Chamberlain? Chamberlain was a maverick, a Victorian chameleon. Arguably he was Britain's first truly modern political figure, an industrialist and businessman who made his way to the cabinet. He was certainly the first major politician to forge his career in local government.

Jeff J Mitchell

Although not a Brummie by birth, he made the city his adopted home. The son of Unitarian parents, he built a profitable business manufacturing screws in the city but was not impressed by the conditions in which his workers had to live. After 30 years of rapid industrial expansion, Birmingham was choking on its own filth. The centre was a convoluted warren of factories, slums and grime. Rival water and gas companies competed with each other mercilessly and yet had each singularly failed to provide the population with a reliable water or power supply. Chamberlain changed all of that. In just three short years as mayor, he transformed the city from an oversized slum to one of the most advanced cities in the world.  He took the gas and water supplies into city ownership and provided its residents with the cleanest and most effective water and power supplies anywhere in the country. 



He ploughed the proceeds into new housing, sewers and civic buildings, a new museum and art gallery, a grand boulevard to rival any street in Paris - today's Corporation Street - and a university. He was the man who built Birmingham. So, an admirable figure for an incoming Tory prime minister to laud? Well, sure, save for the minor detail, that he wasn't a Conservative.Chamberlain started his political life as a Liberal but split from party over the prime minister William Gladstone's policy of Home Rule in Ireland. An avowed imperialist, he took a sizeable cohort of his party's MPs with him, forming the Liberal Unionists. Eventually, the Liberal Unionists and the Conservatives merged, forming the Conservative and Unionist Party - the name remains today.

Theresa May referenced this in her speech, reminding the audience of her party's full name.This was of course a signal of her commitment to the union between the different countries of the United Kingdom, but it was also a nod to something else - the political and intellectual tradition Chamberlain epitomises, the union between Conservatism's upper class base and the working people of Britain.Chamberlain and the Liberal Unionists changed the Conservative Party. They brought with them a focus on the working class and policies that would appeal to them. The Tory Party before Chamberlain hadn't just been a party of the aristocracy and shires, Disraeli had been instrumental in extending the right to vote to many more working men, but without Chamberlain, they wouldn't have had that rich seam of municipal conservatism and social reform on which to draw. Chamberlain was instrumental in persuading Tory prime ministers Lord Salisbury and Arthur Balfour to engage in a number of important social reforms which helped the Conservatives attract new working class support. The Liberal Unionists gave them access to part of the electorate with whom they otherwise would have had little resonance - the skilled working class. The working class Tory remained an important part of the Conservative coalition which went on to govern Britain for 66 out of 100 years of the 20th Century.

In the 1990s and 2000s, however, that support eroded. Even in the 2010 and 2015 elections, the Conservatives struggled to appeal in urban Britain and to a significant proportion of the population who felt "left behind" by globalisation and free-market economics. As the recent Brexit vote demonstrated, that part of the electorate is growing and angry. Theresa May and Nick Timothy appear to be stealing some of Chamberlain's clothes and approach in an attempt to win them back.But this would be quite a shift. Chamberlain does not sit within the tradition of free market, laissez-faire economics and enthusiasm for globalisation to which the Tory party has been committed since the days of Margaret Thatcher. He was a full-throated economic interventionist, called a "gas and water socialist" by his enemies on the right. He took profit-making private enterprises into public hands, declaring that "profit was irrelevant". It's difficult to imagine any Conservative politician from the last 40 years saying the same. Moreover, he was a protectionist, arguing for tariffs on goods from all countries outside of the British Empire.

And what would a Chamberlain approach mean in practice? Well we've already seen hints of it from the new PM. An industrial strategy, the government intervening in markets to protect certain industries; workers on company boards; economic protectionism - note her delay of the Hinkley Point project - a reduction in immigration and a greater focus on devolution of powers to cities and local government.Chamberlain never became prime minister but he and his sons, Austen and Neville dominated politics in Birmingham and the Conservative Party up to the Second World War. He split with the Liberal Party over Ireland, and the Tories over trade, but nonetheless, he seems to be back in vogue.But if Chamberlain really does prove to be Mrs May's inspiration, then Tories across the country should brace themselves for a bit of a shock. Because he really would represent the biggest intellectual shift the party has made since the mid-1970s. Churchill said of Chamberlain that he was a politician who "made the weather". If Theresa May is serious about reawakening this strand of Conservative thinking, she may well yet do the same.Lewis Goodall was reporting for BBC Newsnight. You can watch his report here

The sight of Team GB above China in the Olympic medal table has led some to heap praise on John Major, whose government took the decision to launch the National Lottery. The lottery has poured money into sport in the UK, but can it claim credit for medal success?When Adam Peaty powered to the finish line in his record-breaking 100m breaststroke, it was the result of a big investment by UK Sport.Although spotted as a potential star at the age of 14, Peaty at first relied on fund-raising parties, organised by friends and neighbours, to pay for his travel to national competitions.  Then in 2012 he was awarded a grant of £15,000, while his coach got a place on an elite coaching programme. Both were funded by UK Sport, which receives two-thirds of its funding from the National Lottery. All direct payments to athletes are entirely lottery-funded.
It's not so much the amount of money but the way in which it has been targetedProf Borja Garcia, Loughborough University

Two years later Peaty beat the then Olympic champion in the 100m breaststroke final at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow - the first of many international titles.Top athletes with a record like this are eligible for an annual grant of up to £28,000, leaving them free to concentrate on training. In addition to funding athletes directly, UK Sport gives money to the governing bodies of selected sports - such as British Swimming - to spend on training facilities and trainers, such as Adam Peaty's coach, Mel Marshall.Reportedly, the UK government spent just £5m per year funding Olympic sport before the 1996 Atlanta games. But UK Sport spent £54m on elite sports in the run-up to the Sydney games in 2000 - where Team GB won 28 medals and ranked 10th. By the time of London 2012 it was spending £264m, and Team GB came third in the medal table, with 65 medals.  



 Is that convincing evidence that money buys medals? "Perhaps the strongest evidence is to compare the results Team GB are achieving now and compare them to Atlanta 1996 - the last games before National Lottery funding was introduced when we won one gold medal and came 36th in the medal table," says a UK Sport spokesperson.
Generally we see an increase in medals in the games before a country hosts it, a further increase at their own games and a bump in medals in the two games afterwards - after this results tail back to averageProf David Forrest, Liverpool University

Experts appear to agree."As a researcher I guess I will always have to say that 'correlation does not mean causality'," says Prof Borja Garcia from Loughborough University. "So it cannot all be put down to the increased funding. But it is undeniable that the increase in funding has produced better overall results at the (summer) Olympics."However, Garcia notes that the way money is spent is also critical."It's not so much the amount of money but the way in which it has been targeted, invested and audited," he says. "It has certainly produced results even if some people think of it as a somewhat 'brutal' approach."It's brutal in that funding is only awarded to sports that succeed in demonstrating medal potential in the next two Olympics - and one poor Olympic result can lead to funding being cut altogether.Which sports are funded?Before the beginning of each funding cycle, all sports present to UK Sport a detailed, costed strategy and agree a range of medals which they will aim to achieve at the following Olympic or Paralympic Games. UK Sport scrutinises all the strategies and allocates funding on a "top-down basis". As a spokesperson puts it: "We start with the sports which are targeting the most medals and work downwards i.e. we do not 'salami slice' funding and give some to every sport." The level of funding in each sport is assessed annually and benchmarked against results at milestone target events in each year, to determine whether they are on track for the next Games.Chair of UK Sport, Rod Carr, defended the tough strategy on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, pointing to the example of British Gymnastics: "In the early 2000s they were in a pretty low state. They hadn't had a good Games at Sydney and their funding was cut as a result of that. They went right back to basics, they disassembled their programme and looked at what was working and what wasn't and then built it up again."The women's indoor volleyball team rose more than 60 places in the rankings to reach the world's top 20 in the four years prior to London 2012 - but all funding was withdrawn when they did not win a medal. The UK did not even send a volleyball team to Rio this year.On the other hand, sports that do well - such as cycling and rowing - continue to receive funding, which helps them to stay at the top.

                    Money paid directly to athletes by UK Sport all comes from the National Lottery
                

Liverpool University economist Prof David Forrest agrees that increased funding has delivered more medals, however, he warns that funding for elite sport may not remain at its current level."Generally we see an increase in medals in the games before a country hosts it, a further increase at their own games and a bump in medals in the two games afterwards," he says.
I knew there was no chance of funding the long-term development of sports and the arts from general government revenueJohn Major, PM 1990-1997

"After this results tail back to average. This could well be because politicians are more reluctant to spend extravagantly on elite sports. Priorities may shift."This could mean less money being spent on sport - or perhaps a re-balancing of the money spent on elite sport, on the one hand, and community sport on the other.The Department for Culture and Media and Sport reduced spending on community-level sport by 5% for 2015 and 2016, while protecting elite sports to guarantee "an Olympic sporting legacy."  But if funding is cut at the grass roots this does eventually affect the top of the tree, Forrest says."In the long term, selectors will find they have a far smaller pool of athletes to choose from when choosing athletes for development programmes." Overall, 25% of the money from National Lottery ticket sales is spent on good causes, and 20% of that is allocated to sport. Some of that goes to UK Sport, which funds elite sport, and some goes to the home nation sport councils - Sport England, sportscotland, Sport Wales and Sport NI - which fund community sport.Many British athletes at the Rio Olympics have effusively thanked the National Lottery in televised interviews after winning a medal."I knew there was no chance of funding the long-term development of sports and the arts from general government revenue," John Major told the New Statesman in 1999. "A lottery could do just that."Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook

For years, columns have been written about it. Documentaries have been broadcast about it. Dinner parties have discussed it.Panel shows have teased about it.But today, has it actually happened?It has already prompted the former Labour minister Angela Eagle to splutter: "What? Aghhhh."Prime Minister Theresa May is currently off duty and on holiday, taking the alpine air in Switzerland.  Mrs May is known to have a love of Lucerne, the Bernese Oberland and the resort of Zermatt, with its views of the Matterhorn.All of which means Whitehall's summer rota is up and running - a moment when opportunity knocks for a senior cabinet minister.In previous years, the media have had hours of fun with the idea of John Prescott or Nick Clegg being left in charge of the country while their boss is sunning themselves in foreign climes.'Silly season' The main task of the summer stand-in is to stay out of the headlines and not cause any trouble, although the memo didn't reach John, now Lord Prescott, in 1997, when Tony Blair headed off to Tuscany for his first prime ministerial break.The then deputy prime minister stunned onlookers at what should have been a routine photo opportunity launching a Thames flood protection scheme when he Christened a Chinese mitten crab floating around in a jar "Peter".

His playful dig at friend and rival Peter, now Lord, Mandelson was "silly season" gold for tabloid hacks hungry for New Labour split stories.Theresa May was the summer stand-in herself in 2013, along with the then Foreign Secretary William Hague, when David Cameron and Nick Clegg both decided to take a break at the same time. Last week, as Mrs May headed to the Alps, it was Chancellor Philip Hammond who got the call. Mr Hammond, affectionately nicknamed "Box Office Phil" by reporters, for his capacity for less than riveting public appearances, is seen as the very personification of a "safe pair of hands".It's not a phrase used quite so often about Boris Johnson. Yet the foreign secretary is the "senior minister on duty" in the UK.'Standard practice'Does that mean he is running the country? What is mobile reception like in the upper reaches of the Swiss Alps?"The prime minister is very much in charge and is constantly kept abreast of what is going on," said a Downing Street spokesman.Has Mrs May been on the phone to the foreign secretary?"Not that I'm aware of," the spokesman added.Asked to clarify what being "the senior minister on duty" actually meant, the prime minister's spokesman said: "I don't actually know. I'll try to find out."An hour or so later, Downing Street told me: "It is standard practice for a senior duty minister to be appointed whilst the PM is travelling. "They can attend to urgent business or meetings if required. The PM remains in charge and will be updated throughout."







Media captionLabour leadership challenger Owen Smith outlines his ideas
The man challenging Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership is virtually unknown outside Westminster. So who is Owen Smith?We know who he wants to be. The great unifier. A political miracle worker who can unite Labour's warring factions to win a general election many in the party think will happen sooner rather than later, whatever the new prime minister says. He says he wants to "save the party" and prevent it from what he fears would be a catastrophic split.And we know how he would like to be seen - a more voter-friendly version of Jeremy Corbyn, with similar "radical" left-wing values but a fresh, modern face.But what about the man himself?  His campaign launch - tieless, immaculate white shirt, flanked by his family and a youthful band of supporters - could have come straight from the Cameron/Blair playbook. But his big idea - rewriting Clause IV of the Labour constitution to include a specific commitment to fight inequality - is designed to be a break with the Blair era.He is proud of his Welsh roots. He was born in Morecambe, Lancashire, but grew up in South Wales, and was recently described by the Guardian, as a fully paid-up member of the "Taffia", the Welsh political and media establishment. His father Dai, is a prominent Welsh historian and a one-time chairman of the Arts Council of Wales, whose books include one on Aneurin Bevan as well as The World of South Wales. The man Owen Smith would one day succeed as Labour MP for his home town of Pontypridd, Kim Howells, was a family friend. Owen Smith - the basics

 Age: 46Family: Married to Liz with three children - Jack, 17, Evan, 15, and Isabelle, 13Educated:  Coedylan Primary School, Pontypridd, comprehensive schools in Pontypridd and Barry, University of Sussex, where he studied history and FrenchParliamentary career: MP for Pontypridd since 2010, former shadow work and pensions secretaryJob before politics: BBC producer, lobbyist for pharmaceutical giant PfizerPolicies: Raise the top rate of income tax to 50%, write a commitment to tackling inequality into Labour's constitution, £200bn plan to build new infrastructure and council housing. Backs Trident nuclear weapons and nuclear energy. In contrast to Mr Corbyn, has said he would be prepared to press the nuclear button. Would be "tempted" to call a second EU referendum. Wants to increase the involvement of Labour members in policy decisions.What he says about Jeremy Corbyn: Has praised the Labour leader for helping the party "rediscover its radical roots" but claims the party has fallen in the public's esteem under his leadership and is even seen as a "laughing stock" by some people. Says Mr Corbyn needs to stand aside so the party can become a "serious" and credible alternative government again.Off duty: Watching rugby, he is a regular at Pontypridd RFC, and listening to Bruce Springsteen. Once described his "guilty pleasure" as "too many beers".The young Smith was steeped in the traditions and mythology of Welsh Labour, always to the left of the party nationally, but he credits the 1984 miners' strike as his "political awakening". He recently recalled, in a speech to his constituents, how as a teenager he had marched with striking miners from the Maerdy Colliery, and had been inspired by their "sense of community, solidarity and passion for justice"."This is why I am Labour right to my fingertips. I'm not interested in machine politicking and Westminster parlour games, but rooted politics - that's about making a real and lasting difference to people's lives."He joined the Labour Party at the age of 16, while still a pupil at Barry Boys' Comprehensive School, in the Vale of Glamorgan.



Media captionOwen Smith answers quickfire questions on his political views
After studying history and French at the University of Sussex, he joined BBC Wales as a radio producer in 1992. His father, Dai, was appointed editor of BBC Radio Wales in the same year. Colleagues recall an amiable but highly ambitious character. On one occasion, when he had landed a sought-after job on BBC Radio 4's Today programme in the mid 1990s, in London, his keenness to impress his bosses got the better of him. Asked to call the police to check on a breaking story, the young producer stunned more experienced newsroom hands by dialling 999 to demand an interview with the chief constable.The incident led to an official complaint from the Metropolitan Police.Quizzed about it on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, he said it had been a "pretty stupid" thing to do but he had "pressured" into getting a comment, adding that he did not think he had called the 999 emergency number but a police hotline."It was clearly a really stupid and embarrassing thing to do," he said. "I was embarrassed about it at the time, I am embarrassed about it now, but I think my judgement isn't called into question by this, it was a foolish mistake by a young man." In his own words

"I am on the left of the Labour Party, I share many of Jeremy's values but I think I can talk about modernising those values, I think I can talk about Labour's future, in a way in which no other candidate, including Angela, can," speaking to Channel 4 News on 13 July,."It's not enough just to be anti-austerity, you have got to be pro-something and I am pro-prosperity," launching his leadership bid. "Nye Bevan, my great hero, said it's all about achieving and exercising power," speaking to the Guardian. "I wasn't in Parliament at the time, I would have voted against, I would have been opposed to it at the time," on whether he would have voted for the Iraq war."We are making significant inroads in improving what is happening in Iraq. I thought at the time the tradition of the Labour Party and the tradition of left-wing engagement to remove dictators was a noble, valuable tradition, and one that in South Wales, from the Spanish Civil War onwards, we have recognised and played a part in," speaking to Wales Online, when he was a candidate in the 2006 Blaenau Gwent by-election. He told the site he did not know whether he would have voted for the Iraq war."I'm glad you think I am normal. I am normal. I grew up in a normal household. I've got a wife and three children. My wife is a primary school teacher," responding to a journalist's description of him as "normal" - the comment sparked a Twitter storm and accusations of homophobia against rival Angela Eagle, who is in a civil partnership, something he has firmly denied saying he had been quoted out of context.Smith worked across a range of programmes during his 10 years at the BBC, including Good Morning Wales and political programme Dragon's Eye without becoming a senior editor.So in 2002, he turned his sights to politics and a job as a "special adviser", the Westminster insiders who act as a mouthpiece for ministers and help craft policies. In those days, being a "spad" was a guaranteed fast track to the top - Ed Miliband and David Cameron, among many others, had served their political apprenticeships in this way.Smith's boss, Paul Murphy, now Baron Murphy of Torfaen, was Welsh Secretary and then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, in Tony Blair's cabinet.This was the high water mark of New Labour and he will have been at Murphy's side when he voted for military action in Iraq.But Murphy says his young special adviser disagreed with him over the Iraq war. He describes Smith as belonging to Labour's "soft left" or "Bevanite" tradition, not on the right of the party but someone who can build a "bridge" between the left and the right. After three years as a special adviser, Smith headed off to the private sector, moving to Surrey to take up a job as a lobbyist for pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, on a reported salary of £80,000 a year.Smith has objected to the use of the term lobbyist to describe what he did at Pfizer, telling Sky News: "Let's be clear I wasn't a lobbyist."He said his job, as head of policy and government relations, had given him valuable private sector experience. Other public affairs professionals have defended Smith's former profession.Jon McLeod, corporate affairs chairman of lobbyists Weber Shandwick, told Public Affairs News: "Was he a lobbyist? To the person on the street yes. Is it a bad thing? No... it goes without saying that it helps to have people in power who have worked in industry and understand a key sector."At Pfizer, Smith was involved in an initiative to promote greater "choice" for patients in the NHS, including focus group research on "direct payments" for some services.Jeremy Corbyn's supporters claim this shows he supported NHS privatisation but Smith told ITV's Good Morning Britain such allegations were "clearly a lie".He said the Pfizer report on NHS choice, published in October 2005 in association with the King's Fund charity, had been commissioned before he went to work for the US pharmaceutical giant. He said he had always believed a "100% publicly-owned NHS free at the point of use" but he had supported the Blair government's contracting out of minor operations to private hospitals to clear NHS waiting lists.He said that "with hindsight" the policy had "opened the door to the current government to step through into a real attempt at marketisation and privatisation of the NHS, using the language of the last Labour government".In 2008, Smith moved to Amgen, the UK's biggest biotech firm, to be its head of corporate affairs.What others say"Decent bloke, on the left, can heal rifts that look meaningful inside Westminster and septic from the outside: is any of this enough? Wouldn't we have said the same about Ed Miliband?," Guardian journalist Zoe Williams, who voted for Jeremy Corbyn in last year's leadership election. "He was full on! I think that's the best way to describe Owen. Very, very bright, lots of enthusiasm, very little self-doubt, but a very high standard of what he expected. To be honest, he was challenging to those above him. He was difficult to manage because he set such a high standard and wouldn't accept any nonsense," Lee Waters, Labour's AM for Llanelli, on his former boss at BBC Wales."We have to be a broad church, we need everyone from Jeremy Corbyn, all the way through to people on the right. Owen is very clever, he is astute, he knows when to open his mouth and when to shut up. I think he is absolutely right in his judgement of what is needed right now," Labour MP and Smith supporter Chris Bryant."He's always been very intelligent, very courageous, and he needs that courage now and he needs that energy that he's always shown because this is going to be a battle for Labour's future, I think, for its life," Kim Howells, on his friend and predecessor as Labour MP for Pontypridd."He's nimble, he's a good Labour party dispatch box contributor. He's got a warmth to his character, he's quick to smile and quip, and he's quick-thinking. People like qualities like that," fellow South Wales Labour MP Nick Smith, speaking to the Guardian."It speaks well of him that he's gathered a good and loyal group of MPs around him. Many are part of the next generation of politicians, much more interested in dealing with the pressing problems of 2016 than in fighting old battles," Lisa Nandy, a Smith supporter, in the Guardian.Three years earlier, while still a lobbyist at Pfizer, he had made his first, disastrous, attempt to become an MP in the previously rock-solid Labour seat of Blaenau Gwent.The by-election had been triggered by the death of Independent MP Peter Law, who had won the seat from Labour after a row over women-only shortlists in 2005.

Smith ran a slick campaign, leading his opponents to dub him "oily Smith". He was also mocked as "Viagra man" after his employer's most famous product.He achieved a swing back to Labour, but the electorate had not yet forgiven the party and the seat was won by another Independent, Dai Davies.In a defiant speech after losing the election, he echoed his political hero Nye Bevan, saying: "I agree with Dai that politics is about people, but it is also about power."He said Labour had "given power to the people" of the Welsh valleys and it had to continue to "reach out to people", warning against becoming "introverted" and "isolated". Friends say the experience of losing in Blaenau Gwent gave him a valuable early lesson in how Labour was losing touch with voters in its traditional heartlands - and the growing gap between the grassroots and the Westminster party elite.'Tasteless analogy'But statements he made at the time, in an interview with Wales Online, would come back to haunt him, as Jeremy Corbyn's supporters sought to portray him as not as solidly left-wing as he was now claiming.On the involvement of private companies in delivering NHS services, he said at the time: "Where they can bring good ideas, where they can bring valuable services that the NHS is not able to deliver, and where they can work alongside but subservient to the NHS and without diminishing in any respect the public service ethos of the NHS, then I think that's fine. I think if their involvement means in any way, shape or form the break-up of the NHS, then I'm not a fan of it, but I don't think it does."

He also hailed PFI schemes, which he said had delivered new hospitals in Wales, and city academies, which he said had made "great inroads" in areas with failing schools. "I'm not someone, frankly, who gets terribly wound up about some of the ideological nuances that get read into some of these things, and I think sometimes they are totally overblown," he told the site.He did not apply to fight Blaenau Gwent again, but instead seized the chance to stand in his home town when Kim Howells, the MP there, decided to stand down.Mr Smith held Pontypridd for Labour at the 2010 general election, but Mr Howell's 13,000 majority was reduced with a swing to the Liberal Democrats of more than 13%.Shortly after his election, he had to apologise for comments in an online article in which he compared the coalition's spending cuts to "domestic violence" against the Liberal Democrats. Women's activists called it a "tasteless analogy".In his maiden speech he attacked the coalition government's proposals for academies and "free schools". He supported Ed Miliband in the Labour leadership contest and was rewarded with a junior shadow cabinet role, as deputy to Shadow Welsh Secretary Peter Hain.A year later, he was moved to be number four in the team shadowing the Treasury and, a year after that, he was promoted into the shadow cabinet, with the Wales brief, following Peter Hain's retirement.He promised that a future Labour government would give Wales the same financial powers as Scotland, subject to a referendum and agreement with the Welsh government on funding.Welfare voteIn the 2015 leadership election, which saw Jeremy Corbyn swept to victory by Labour members, he backed Andy Burnham and, like Mr Burnham, abstained in a Commons vote on the government's controversial welfare bill, something he has since described as a "mistake"."I argued in shadow cabinet we oughtn't to be abstaining on it and I was part of Andy Burnham's campaign telling Andy that we ought to be resigning on the issue," he told the BBC's Andrew Marr.As shadow work and pensions secretary, he said he had opposed the bill "outright" and claimed to have got tax credit cuts and disability benefit cuts, which had also been opposed by a group of Tory backbenchers, overturned.Like Mr Burnham, Smith opted to stay in the shadow cabinet when Jeremy Corbyn took over - refusing to follow other colleagues from the Ed Miliband era on to the back benches.He was handed the crucial role of shadow work and pensions secretary, going up against Iain Duncan Smith in the Commons, in some memorably fiery encounters.In March this year, he asked Mr Duncan Smith "how he sleeps at night" after imposing cuts to disability support. He predicted that Mr Corbyn's election as leader would give Labour an army of new supporters in Wales - and he stayed loyal to the leader in December 2015's crunch vote on air strikes in Syria, which split the Parliamentary Party and set the scene for the chaos it now finds itself in.'Unity' candidatesSmith had spoken about his leadership ambitions last year but friends insist he would not have challenged Mr Corbyn if it had not been for a series of events in the aftermath of the EU referendum result.He was part of a delegation of like-minded Labour MPs, non-Blairites who had stayed loyal to Mr Corbyn but who were alarmed by the collapse in support for him after the EU referendum result. The MPs say they wanted to act as a bridge between Mr Corbyn and Labour MPs. Smith claims shadow chancellor John McDonnell, when asked about the danger that the party could split, had replied: "If that's what it takes."  This was not the deciding factor for Smith, say his allies, and he still had to be encouraged to stand, but he was quick to repeat the quote on social media. Others claim Smith had plotted all along to challenge Mr Corbyn and had been positioning himself as a left-wing candidate who could win over the Corbyn-loving grassroots.Former shadow business secretary Angela Eagle - someone with a bigger public profile and a longer record as an MP than Smith - was first to stake a claim to that position, launching a bid to be Labour's first female leader. Smith entered the race late, saying he had to deal with a family emergency, but was determined to seize his moment to present himself as the future face of the Labour Party and refused calls on him to stand down to give Ms Eagle a clear run.We were then treated to the spectacle of two "unity" candidates battling it out in public for the right to challenge Mr Corbyn. It came down to a race between the two rival teams to see who could gain the most nominations from Labour MPs. Owen Smith won that battle. But the battle he now has to convince Labour Party members that he is a better bet than Jeremy Corbyn, less than a year after they voted him into the top job by an overwhelming majority, will be immeasurably harder.

There's no disguising the confidence in Jeremy Corbyn's camp about this leadership election.Membership of the Labour Party has soared since the general election and Mr Corbyn believes most of these new members are his supporters.The hope of his opponents is that many may have become disillusioned with his leadership.But having spent a day in Leeds meeting new and older members of the local party, I found scant evidence for this.If anything, Mr Corbyn's supporters seem ever more determined to defend him.So who are these new members; the so called "Corbynistas"?

                    Jane Ingham and Ged Colgan question whether Labour MPs are too comfortable with the status quo
                

I spent time with four of them: Jane Ingham , 65, a retired head teacher, Ged Colgan, 26, a hotel worker, Marvina Newton, 30, a local charity manager and Jane Aitchison, who is in her 40s and is a trade unionist.What quickly became clear was that, not only was Jeremy Corbyn the main reason they joined the Labour Party, but they remain fiercely loyal to him. Mr Corbyn, they believe, offers inspiration and change.  In the past Labour had become too similar to the Conservatives; particularly over austerity, they say. Jeremy Corbyn represented a break with the traditional way of doing politics"He's unlike anyone," says Marvina. "To me that's what is great about him. He speaks from the heart. "What was also clear was the disdain all four had for those Labour MPs seemingly determined to oppose Jeremy Corbyn."Unfortunately they have been part of a style of politics that has not only failed to win elections but they have been consistently wrong about a whole range of issues," says Ged.

                    Marvina Newton on Jeremy Corbyn: "He speaks from the heart."
                

Jane the retired head teacher is similarly unimpressed."I'm quite disappointed with the MPs. Do too many of them have too many privileges and just enjoy the privilege of being members of Parliament?"And there's no disguising the fact these new members are prepared for a fight should Labour MPs continue to refuse to back Mr Corbyn, if he wins this leadership contest.No-one mentions the D-word, deselection. But the warning signs are clear."It's perfectly legitimate for local members to choose who they want to be their candidate at the next election," warns Ged. "I don't see why being an MP should be treated like a job for life."Jane, the trade unionist, agrees.

                    Trade unionist Jane Aitchison says MPs' "cosy position" is being threatened
                

"They (the MPs) do feel threatened. We represent change and Jeremy represents huge change and that threatens their very cosy position."So what of longer-serving party members? How do they view this influx of pro-Corbyn new members ?Away from the city centre in one of Leeds' more deprived areas, Seacroft, a rock-solid Labour area, I met up with two long-standing party members: Les Wrigglesworth, a former miner, and Melvyn Burton.They both praise the energy and enthusiasm of the new recruits.However they are more cautious over how committed these new members will remain to the Labour Party.




Image caption

                    In Leeds, Labour Party membership has more than trebled in a year
                

Les says they may prove "fair weather" members.They are both dismissive, however, of claims that many of the new members are so-called "entryists" from Trotskyite and other hard-left groups.Les dismisses the idea as a "red herring". There may be a few entryists, he says, but only a tiny minority.Melvyn believes the new members may be "naive" in their views but they are not Trotskyists.It's only a snap shot but my impression is that even those party members who are not supporters of Jeremy Corbyn are far from happy about the challenge to his leadership.Some regard it as a distraction from the business of opposing the Conservatives; others as undemocratic; others still as a precursor to a possible all-out civil war or even split in the party.The difficulty is that Mr Corbyn has become the sticking point.Many Labour MPs believe he threatens Labour's very survival as a credible political party.But if they are hoping the membership is poised to turn against him - I found precious little sign of it in Leeds.

Theresa May is the new Conservative Party leader and second female prime minister, taking charge of the UK at one of the most turbulent times in recent political history. The 59-year-old home secretary's carefully cultivated image of political dependability and unflappability appears to have made her the right person at the right time as the fallout from the UK's vote to leave the EU smashed possible rivals out of contention.Long known to have nurtured leadership hopes, Mrs May - whose friends recall her early ambition to be the UK's first female PM - could have reasonably expected to have had to wait until at least 2018 to have a shot at Downing Street. But the EU referendum which David Cameron called and lost - the year after leading the party to its first election win in 23 years - turned political certainties on their head and, as other candidates fell by the wayside after the PM's own resignation, Mrs May emerged as the "unity" candidate to succeed him.That her party should rally round her at such a time of national uncertainty is testament not only to the respect in which she is held across the party but to the fact that, in a world where political reputations can be shredded in an instant, Mrs May is the ultimate political survivor.

In the early days at Westminster she became known for her exuberant choice of footwear - her kitten heels became famous in political circles in the noughties, while she named a lifetime subscription to Vogue as the luxury item she would take to a desert island.But it is her toughness which has become her political hallmark. She has coped with being one of only a small number of women in the upper echelons of the Conservative Party for 17 years and has been prepared to tell her party some hard truths - famously informing activists at the 2002 conference that "you know what some people call us - the nasty party".Who is Theresa May?

Says people want more than just a "Brexit PM" and has vowed to unify the Leave and Remain factions in the party.
 Even before entering Downing Street, she made history by becoming the second longest serving home secretary in the past 100 years.The daughter of a Church of England vicar, Hubert, who died from injuries sustained in a car crash when she was only 25, Theresa May's middle class background has more in keeping with the last female occupant of Downing Street, Margaret Thatcher, than her immediate predecessor.

Born in Sussex but raised largely in Oxfordshire, Mrs May - both of whose grandmothers are reported to have been in domestic service - attended a state primary, an independent convent school and then a grammar school in the village of Wheatley, which became the Wheatley Park Comprehensive School during her time there. The young Theresa Brasier, as she was then, threw herself into village life, taking part in a pantomime that was produced by her father and working in the bakery on Saturdays to earn pocket money.Friends recall a tall, fashion-conscious young woman who from an early age spoke of her ambition to be the first woman prime minister.

Like Margaret Thatcher, she went to Oxford University to study and, like so many others of her generation, found that her personal and political lives soon became closely intertwined.In 1976, in her third year, she met her husband Philip, who was president of the Oxford Union, a well-known breeding ground for future political leaders. The story has it that they were introduced at a Conservative Association disco by the subsequent Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto. They married in 1980.Her university friend Pat Frankland, speaking in 2011 on a BBC Radio 4 profile of the then home secretary, said: "I cannot remember a time when she did not have political ambitions."I well remember, at the time, that she did want to become the first woman prime minister and she was quite irritated when Margaret Thatcher got there first."

There are no tales of drunken student revelry, but Pat Frankland and other friends say May was not the austere figure she would later come to be seen as, saying she had a sense of fun and a full social life.After graduating with a degree in Geography, May went to work in the City, initially starting work at the Bank of England and later rising to become head of the European Affairs Unit of the Association for Payment Clearing Services.But it was already clear that she saw her future in politics. She was elected as a local councillor in Merton, south London, and served her ward for a decade, rising to become deputy leader. However, she was soon setting her sights even higher.Mrs May, who has become a confidante as well as role model for aspiring female MPs - told prospective candidates before the 2015 election that "there is always a seat out there with your name on it". 



Media captionA look at Theresa May's journey to the top job
In her case - like that of Margaret Thatcher - it took a bit of time for her to find hers. She first dipped her toe in the water in 1992, where she stood in the safe Labour seat of North West Durham, coming a distant second to Hilary Armstrong, who went on to become Labour's chief whip in the Blair government. Her fellow candidates in that contest also included a very youthful Tim Farron, who is now Lib Dem leader.Two years later, she stood in Barking, east London, in a by-election where - with the Conservative government at the height of its unpopularity - she got fewer than 2,000 votes and saw her vote share dip more than 20%. But her luck was about to change. The Conservatives' electoral fortunes may have hit a nadir in 1997, when Tony Blair came to power in a Labour landslide, but there was a silver lining for the party and for the aspiring politician when she won the seat of Maidenhead in Berkshire. It's a seat she has held ever since.

An early advocate of Conservative "modernisation" in the wilderness years that followed, Mrs May quickly joined the shadow cabinet in 1999 under William Hague as shadow education secretary and in 2002 she became the party's first female chairman under Iain Duncan Smith.She then held a range of senior posts under Michael Howard but was conspicuously not part of the "Notting Hill set" which grabbed control of the party after its third successive defeat in 2005 and laid David Cameron and George Osborne's path to power.This was perhaps reflected in the fact that she was initially given the rather underwhelming job of shadow leader of the House of Commons. But she gradually raised her standing and by 2009 had become shadow work and pensions secretary.Nevertheless, her promotion to the job of home secretary when the Conservatives joined with the Lib Dems to form the first coalition government in 70 years was still something of a surprise - given that Chris Grayling had been shadowing the brief in opposition.While the Home Office turned out to be the political graveyard of many a secretary of state in previous decades, Mrs May refused to let this happen - mastering her brief with what was said to be a microscopic attention to detail and no little willingness to enter into battles with fellow ministers when she thought it necessary.

                    Theresa May initially fell down the pecking order under David Cameron but worked her way back up
                

While some in Downing Street worried that the Home Office was becoming her own personal fiefdom, she engendered loyalty among her ministers and was regarded as "unmovable" as her tough-talking style met with public approval even when the department's record did not always seem so strong. In his memoir of his time in office, former Lib Dem minister David Laws says: "She would frequently clash with George Osborne over immigration. She rarely got on anything but badly with Michael Gove. She and Cameron seemed to view each other with mutual suspicion."I first met her in 2010. I was sitting in my Treasury office, overlooking St James's Park, me in one armchair and the home secretary in the other, with no officials present. She looked nervous."I felt she was surprised to find herself as home secretary. Frankly, I didn't expect her to last more than a couple of years." Despite her liberal instincts in some policy areas, she frequently clashed with the then deputy prime minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, particularly over her plan to increase internet surveillance to combat terrorism, dubbed the "Snooper's Charter" by the Lib Dems.After one "difficult" meeting with Mr Clegg, he reportedly told David Laws: "You know, I've grown to rather like Theresa May... 'She's a bit of an Ice Maiden and has no small talk whatsoever - none. I have quite difficult meetings with her. Cameron once said, 'She's exactly like that with me too!'"She is instinctively secretive and very rigid, but you can be tough with her and she'll go away and think it all through again."

On the plus side crime levels fell, the UK avoided a mass terrorist attack and in 2013, she successfully deported radical cleric Abu Qatada - something she lists as one of her proudest achievements, along with preventing the extradition to America of computer hacker Gary McKinnon.She was not afraid to take on vested interests, stunning the annual conference of the Police Federation in 2014 by telling them corruption problems were not just limited to "a few bad apples" and threatening to end the federation's automatic right to enrol officers as its members.However, the Passport Office suffered a near meltdown while she has faced constant criticism over the government's failure to meet its promise to get net migration down to below 100,000 a year.Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who went up against her in the Commons as shadow home secretary, told The Guardian: "I respect her style - it is steady and serious. She is authoritative in parliament - superficial attacks on her bounce off. "The flip side is that she is not fleet of foot when crises build, she digs in her heels (remember the Passport Agency crisis in 2014 when the backlog caused hundreds to miss their holidays, and the Border Force crisis in 2011 when border checks were axed)."And she hides when things go wrong. No interviews, no quotes, nothing to reassure people or to remind people she even exists. It's helped her survive as home secretary - but if you are prime minister, eventually the buck has to stop."There was a bitter public row with cabinet colleague Michael Gove over the best way to combat Islamist extremism, which ended with Mr Gove having to apologise to the prime minister and Mrs May having to sack a long-serving special adviser - a turf war which is said to have led to a diminution in her admiration for the prime minister.Key policies:Where she stands on Brexit: Theresa May has insisted "Brexit means Brexit" and there will be no second referendum on the issue. She says official talks on leaving, which will begin when the UK triggers the so-called Article 50, won't begin until the end of 2016 at earliest. She has insisted the status of EU nationals in the UK won't change until a new "legal agreement" is reached but has yet to give a guarantee on their status. She says the best deal is needed to trade with the EU in goods and services but more control is needed to lower immigration.Other policies: Theresa May has pledged a shake-up of boardroom ethics as part of which workers will be guaranteed representation on company boards while shareholders votes on executive pay deals will be made binding every year.What the press say: "In a political party that struggles to shake off its elitist, old Etonian, yah-boo-sucks reputation, May represents a different kind of politician: a calm headmistress in a chamber full of over-excitable public schoolboys. She holds herself at one remove... her obdurate stance has earned her some vociferous critics. There are those who claim that, while she takes care never to sully her own hands with the grubby business of political backstabbing, she will send out her team to issue ferocious briefings against her rivals." The Guardian.Former Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke also had run-ins with her and was recorded on camera ahead of an interview last week saying that Mrs May was good at her job but a "bloody difficult woman" - before adding as an aside, a bit like Mrs Thatcher. A reference to be Conservative leader can hardly come better than that. Mrs May has never been one of the most clubbable of politicians and is someone who prefers not having to tour the tea rooms of the House of Commons - where tittle-tattle is freely exchanged.She has rarely opened up about her private life although she revealed in 2013 that she had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes and would require insulin injections twice a day for the rest of her life - something she says she had come to terms with and which would not affect her career.

Generally thought to be in the mainstream of Conservative thinking on most economic and law and order issues, she has also challenged convention by attacking police stop and search powers and calling for a probe into the application of Sharia Law in British communities. She also expressed a personal desire to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights but later said she would not pursue this as PM due to a lack of parliamentary support - an example of what many believe will be pragmatism in office. Her social attitudes are slightly harder to pin down. She backed same sex marriage. She expressed a personal view in 2012 that the legal limit on abortion should be lowered from 24 to 20 weeks. Along with most Conservative MPs she voted against an outright ban on foxhunting.What is undisputable is that at 59, Mrs May will be oldest leader to enter Downing Street since James Callaghan in 1976 and will be the first prime minister since Ted Heath who does not have children.

One of Westminster's shrewdest as well as toughest operators, Mrs May's decision to campaign for the UK to remain in the EU but to do so in an understated way and to frame her argument in relatively narrow security terms reaped dividends after the divisive campaign.During what turned out to be a short-lived leadership campaign, Mrs May played strongly on her weight of experience, judgement and reliability in a time of crisis.While her wider political appeal is, as yet, untested, Mrs May will not have to face a general election until May 2020 unless she decides to seek a fresh mandate - something she has seemingly ruled out. While the early years of Mrs May's time in Downing Street may be dominated by the process of divorcing the UK from the EU and the deal she will be able to strike, she has also insisted she won't be content with the "safe pair of hands" tag that is often  attached to her.Brexit, she has said, won't be allowed purely to define her time in office and she has promised a radical programme of social reform, underpinned by values of One Nation Toryism, to promote social mobility and opportunity for the more disadvantaged in society.But with a slender parliamentary majority of 17 and a nation still riven by divisions over the EU referendum and anxiety over the future, she will face as tough a task, some say even tougher, than any of her recent predecessors in Downing Street.







Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith have both set out their stalls to become the next Labour leader. So where do they stand on the key policy issues?The economy, jobs and pay

At his campaign launch Mr Corbyn said any business with more than 21 staff would be forced to publish pay audits in an attempt to crack down on discriminatory wage practices. He has said he wants two million new skilled manufacturing jobs and a "full" living wage, starting with care workers. Owen Smith has said he would bring back wage councils, whereby employers and workers' representatives sit on boards to establish pay rates. He has also promised a £200bn investment package - a "British New Deal" - to renew housing and infrastructure. He is proposing the abolition of "zero hours" contracts and their replacement with minimum guaranteed working hours. He also proposes workers be placed on company remuneration committees and an end to the public sector pay freeze.Tax

Both candidates have said they would reintroduce a 50p top rate of income tax for earnings over £150,000.Jeremy Corbyn has said the government should consider imposing "direct rule" on British overseas territories and dependencies if they do not comply with UK tax law, and has criticised government cuts to corporation tax.Owen Smith has said Labour has been "too timid" about taxation and called for a more "progressive" system. In addition to a 50p tax rate, he is calling for a 15% tax on wealth for the richest 1% - raising £2.8bn a year - a reversal of cuts to inheritance tax and corporation tax and to raise capital gains tax from its current 20% rate.Health

Every potential Labour leader understands the near sacred importance of the NHS to the party faithful and this area has the potential to see an ugly fight develop. In 2005, as a Pfizer lobbyist, Owen Smith commented on a report about public attitudes to a range of ideas on healthcare provision including care outside hospitals and further expansion of private providers.He said: "We believe that choice is a good thing." The quotes have re-emerged, forcing Mr Smith to say he believed in a "100% publicly-owned NHS free at the point of use". He went on: "It has been one of Labour's profoundest achievements. I grew up swaddled in stories of the Labour Party creating the NHS."Mr Smith has pledged in inject more funds in to the NHS, calling for a 4% real-terms increase in spending in every year of the next parliament.During his launch Mr Corbyn took a dig at his rival's former job with Pfizer saying he hoped Mr Smith would agree with him that the NHS should be free at the point of use. He said it "should be run by publicly-employed workers working for the NHS not for private contractors, and medical research shouldn't be farmed out to big pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer".Welfare

Jeremy Corbyn used his launch to draw on a totemic issue for Labour - the foundation of the welfare state in the 1940s. He pledged to defend the party's "greatest creation" of social protection for all, speaking of the economist William Beveridge's five "giant evils" of want, disease, ignorance, squalor and idleness. But he said society now faces a different set of injustices: inequality, neglect, insecurity, prejudice and discrimination.Owen Smith has backed increasing welfare payments and voted against welfare cuts. He has supported the principle of the government's much troubled Universal Credit - an attempt to streamline several in-work benefits. But he attacked cuts to its budget and this year called for a review of the plans. He says he would abolish the Department for Work and Pensions, and replace it with a Ministry for Labour and a Department for Social Security.Mr Corbyn will be able to point to the fact that in 2015 he was among almost 50 Labour rebels who defied party orders to abstain on the government's Welfare Bill. The legislation included plans to limit child tax credit to two children. Mr Smith abstained, before voting against the bill in its third reading.Foreign affairs and defence

This is another area where there is a clear difference between the voting records of the two candidates. The government's recent vote saw Labour split three ways on plans to renew Britain's fleet of submarines armed with Trident nuclear warheads.Jeremy Corbyn, a lifelong campaigner for unilateral disarmament, voting against the motion. Mr Smith was among 140 Labour MPs who voted with the government, backing official party policy. Mr Corbyn has consistently voted against the use of UK military forces in combat, including the Iraq war in 2003.Mr Smith was not in Parliament when the Iraq War started. But speaking to the Wales Online website in 2006, he said he did not know whether he would have voted for conflict.He said: "We are making significant inroads in improving what is happening in Iraq."I thought at the time the tradition of the Labour Party and the tradition of left-wing engagement to remove dictators was a noble, valuable tradition, and one that in South Wales, from the Spanish Civil War onwards, we have recognised and played a part in."More recently Mr Smith has said he would have voted against the war. Both candidates were opposed to extending UK air strikes to Syria in 2015. 


 Violent extremist prisoners are to be held in separate special units inside jails under government plans to stop other inmates being radicalised."There are a small number of individuals, very subversive individuals, who do need to be held in separate units," said Justice Secretary Liz Truss. 
 
 Charles Moore, the former Daily Telegraph editor, sought to expose security flaws in the voting system when he voted twice in the EU referendum. However, the Electoral Commission said it had referred Mr Moore to the police as “voting twice in an election is obviously an offence”.
 
 The GMB has said the refusal by Showsec to sign a union agreement means it should not be given the job of providing security at the Labour Party conference.Roger Jenkins, GMB national officer for the security industry, told the BBC that employing the company would be against Labour policy.The union is calling on the party to find an alternative contractor for the event in Liverpool to avoid it being "scuppered".Labour sources said they were confident the conference would go ahead as planned.
 
 Former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell has spoken about his brother’s struggle with schizophrenia after he died last week aged 62.People with the condition tend to live on average 20 years less than most people.He has never spoken about his brother Donald and now is campaigning for better understanding of mental health."It's only when you’re in moments of crises or when you stop taking medication, that with somebody like Donald, people would know."

Jeremy Corbyn took the political world by surprise when he romped to victory in last year's Labour leadership contest, having begun the contest as a rank outsider.He enjoys strong support from many Labour Party members but he does not command the confidence of the majority of his MPs, losing a vote of no confidence by 172 to 40.The vote was triggered by Labour MPs unhappy with Mr Corbyn's leadership and critical of his "lacklustre" campaign to stay in the European Union.A north London MP since 1983, he has long been a stalwart of the British left and spent his career on the backbenches fighting a rearguard action against Labour's abandonment of the radical policies and values contained in its 1983 manifesto, such as a commitment to renationalising the utilities and nuclear disarmament.Mr Corbyn has been a virtually ever-present figure at demos and marches, a joiner of committees and a champion of - sometimes unfashionable - leftwing causes. He was one of the key figures in the Stop the War campaign against the Iraq War. He began his education at the fee-paying preparatory school, Castle House, in Newport, before moving into the state sector, after passing his 11-plus.He is a vegetarian and does not drink alcohol. He lives with his third wife and has three sons from an earlier marriage.What has he said on Brexit? Trigger Article 50, the formal process for leaving the EU, straight away. "The British people have made their decision. We must respect that result and Article 50 has to be invoked now so that we negotiate an exit from European Union... There must be the best deal possible in order to ensure strong industries in Britain stay strong and strong industries that have big export markets protect retain those export markets. But we are in some very difficult areas."Full profile: The Jeremy Corbyn StoryOwen Smith

First elected to Parliament in 2010, as the MP for Pontypridd, Owen Smith quickly rose up the party ranks, and was appointed a shadow minister for Wales within months.In 2012 he was promoted to shadow secretary of state for Wales, before shadowing the work and pensions brief. But Mr Smith was one of a series of shadow cabinet members to recently resign over Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.Mr Smith, 46, has been a Labour Party member since the age of 16, at which time he was a pupil at Barry Boys Comprehensive School in the Vale of Glamorgan, before moving on to study history and French at the University of Sussex.A career in journalism at the BBC followed, where he plied his trade as a radio and a television producer. He left to take up a role as a government special adviser to former Torfaen MP Paul Murphy, principally at the Northern Ireland Office.He has also worked as a lobbyist for pharmaceutical company Pfizer.Mr Smith lives in the Pontypridd area with his wife, Liz, and their three children.Launching his leadership campaign, Mr Smith pitched himself as the candidate that could unite the Labour Party. He has vowed to put tackling inequality at the heart of the party's mission.Brexit position: He has suggested the possibility of a second referendum on EU membership, but said it would depend on what kind of deal the UK negotiated on the terms of Brexit. "I don't think we should accept we're on a definite path out. I think we need to make sure people are satisfied. We trusted people, rightly, to take the decision. We can trust them again in 18 months' time to check it's absolutely what they wanted."Full profile: The Owen Smith storyAngela Eagle - withdrawn

The first to throw her hat in to the ring and challenge Jeremy Corbyn for the leadership, Angela Eagle has withdrawn from the race in order to back Owen Smith as a "unity candidate" to take on Mr Corbyn.She said Mr Smith had received more nominations from Labour MPs and MEPs and she was dropping out "in the interests of the party" and would back Mr Smith "with all her might and enthusiasm".Ms Eagle said Labour "is not working" under Mr Corbyn's leadership, and added: "We need to have a strong and united Labour Party… to take the fight to the Conservative government and heal our country."First elected as MP for Wallasey in 1992, Ms Eagle was one of the youngest MPs in Parliament at the age of 31 - and also one of the first openly gay female MPs when she came out in 1997.Ms Eagle stood in the deputy leadership contest in 2015 and has served in both government and opposition. She stepped down as shadow business secretary and shadow first secretary of state under Jeremy Corbyn in June, saying a change in leader was required.The Yorkshire-born MP - who represented the Remain side in some of the EU referendum TV debates - was comprehensive school-educated before going to Oxford University to read philosophy, politics and economics.She has an identical twin sister, Maria, who has also served in government. They are the first set of twins to be elected as MPs.In her pitch for the leadership, she said she could provide the leadership "in dark times for Labour"  and bring the party and the country "back together".What has she said on Brexit? It would "cause chaos" to trigger Article 50 straight away. "We need to spend more time disentangling ourselves from the European Union in a way which does the least damage. We need to be very focused on that… I wouldn't rush to the exits."Why is Jeremy Corbyn facing a leadership challenge?

Jeremy Corbyn has always had relatively little support among the party's 232 MPs. In last year's leadership contest candidates had to be nominated by 35 Labour MPs to go through to the wider vote of party members.Mr Corbyn only managed to get the backing of that many after some Labour MPs - including London mayor Sadiq Khan - decided to nominate him to "widen the debate" by ensuring there was a left-wing Labour voice in the contest.Although he was seen as the outsider in the contest, when it moved to the wider vote of party members and the new "£3 supporters", he surprised commentators and the party's top brass as he surged through to be elected Labour leader, with 59.5% of the vote.That victory included overwhelming support from all the groups who voted in the contest - party members, affiliated supporters - including trade unionists - and registered supporters who rallied behind his anti-austerity message and promise of a new politics. Under Mr Corbyn, Labour has won the by-elections in seats it has defended. But it has also had what was judged to be a disappointing set of results in May's elections around the UK.The trigger for the move against him was the UK's vote to leave the EU. Labour rebels say they felt Mr Corbyn - the most Eurosceptic Labour leader for 30 years - had not shown enough enthusiasm and leadership during the campaign, despite arguing for a Remain vote. Dozens of his frontbench team have walked out since Hilary Benn was sacked on 26 June, saying Mr Corbyn cannot win a general election. The Labour leader has said he will carry on, replacing them with colleagues who are more sympathetic to his political views. What are Jeremy Corbyn's allies saying?

Mr Corbyn's allies insist that he is "not going anywhere" and that he wants to lead the party into the next general election. They say that after the Brexit vote and in the midst of a Conservative Party leadership contest, Labour should be focusing on opposing the government rather than getting involved in internal party battles.His allies said the vote of no confidence on 28 June, which he lost by 172 votes to 40, was "unconstitutional", arguing that his election victory last year gave him the biggest mandate of any opposition Labour leader in history. They say he is more in touch with Labour voters' views on a range of issues, including the economy, defence and Europe, than MPs in the centre and centre-right of the party. Mr Corbyn has urged people to "unite" behind him at a critical moment for the country, saying he was democratically elected "for a new kind of politics by 60% of Labour members and supporters" and that he will "not betray them" by resigning.The next general election is not due to take place until 2020. New PM Theresa May has said she will not call an early election, but she may yet face pressure to do so - potentially within the next year.Can a sitting leader of the party be challenged?




Image caption

                    Neil Kinnock was the last sitting Labour leader to face a challenge
                

In short, yes - but there are hurdles to overcome.Anyone wishing to challenge Mr Corbyn needs the backing of 20% of Labour MPs and MEPs. Currently there are 231 Labour MPs and 20 Labour MEPs so any potential candidate needs the formal support of 51 of them. Ms Eagle was the first to launch a challenge, which involved writing a letter to Labour's general secretary Iain McNicol announcing an intention to stand.Why is Mr Corbyn automatically on the ballot paper?The party's National Executive Committee decided by 18 votes to 14 that Jeremy Corbyn should be automatically included on the ballot in Labour's leadership contest.This meant he did not need to secure MPs' backing.However, some anti-Corbyn factions in the party believe he should not automatically have been allowed onto the ballot.They pointed to a Times article in November 2015 which reported that legal advice had been sought by the party which suggested a sitting leader would need to receive nominations from MPs and MEPs in order to stand again. Labour donor and former parliamentary candidate Michael Foster launched a legal challenge to the party's ruling putting Mr Corbyn automatically on the ballot - but it was rejected by the judge.The only time since 1945 that a sitting Labour leader has been challenged was in 1988 when Tony Benn sought to topple Neil Kinnock. Neil Kinnock said he had to be endorsed by members of the Parliamentary Labour Party in order to get on the ballot paper - which some argued had set a precedent.Mr Corbyn said the electoral college system in place in 1988 has been replaced by "one member one vote" and said the rules are "absolutely clear" that "the existing leader, if challenged, should be on the ballot paper anyway". He called the court case a "waste of time and resources".

The UK has voted to leave the EU - a process that has come to be known as Brexit. Here is what is likely to happen next.The story so farAt exactly 06:00 BST on 24 June it was confirmed that the UK had voted to leave the European Union. The first thing to stress is that the UK will not leave immediately. The UK is still a member of the EU and will probably remain so for several years. But the vote has already triggered an extraordinary chain of events. A new prime minister needed

In a statement outside Downing Street, David Cameron said the government would respect the result and carry out the instructions of the British people, reassuring the 2.9 million EU citizens in the UK that they will not be adversely affected.Although it was his responsibility to remain in No 10 to "steady the ship", he announced he would step down in the autumn as he was not the right "captain to steer the country to its next destination".A new Conservative leader and prime minister is expected to be elected by 9 September. Under the party's existing rules, Conservative MPs would hold a series of ballots, with all but the two most popular candidates being eliminated. The final two will then go into a run-off in which all Conservative Party members will get a vote. This was the system used to elect Mr Cameron in 2005. Will Labour follow suit?

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has come under huge pressure from within his party to consider his position but he has insisted he will not step down.MPs have passed a motion of no confidence in Mr Corbyn, accusing him of weak leadership during the referendum campaign and he is trying to fill gaps in his shadow cabinet following a wave of resignations. This is not a formal mechanism for removing Mr Corbyn and he could survive even if the vote, should it take place, went against him. He has warned: "Those who want to change Labour's leadership will have to stand in a democratic election, in which I will be a candidate."His critics had hoped the vote and resignations might force him to either step down voluntarily or precipitate a formal challenge - which would require 50 MPs to write to the party's general secretary and a challenger to come forward with sufficient nominations to get on the ballot paper.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has effectively challenged the would-be challengers, saying that even if Mr Corbyn was forced to stand for re-election, he would win when it came to a vote of the party members and supporters. This one looks set to run for a while yet.The markets react

Market reaction to the referendum result was immediate and dramatic. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares fell 8% after opening in London on Friday. There was a big sell-off of bank shares and housebuilders, with Barclays and RBS at one point down by more than 30%. By the end of trading, the index had bounced back, closing 2.8% down. The FTSE 250 index closed down 7% on Friday. The value of the pound has also been hit hard on the foreign exchange markets, tumbling to lows not seen since 1985. At one stage, it hit $1.3305, a fall of more than 10%, although it too slightly recovered to close down 9% at $1.36. Chancellor George Osborne made a statement before the UK stock market opened on Monday in a bid to calm the markets. He said the UK was ready to face the future "from a position of strength" and indicated there would be no immediate emergency Budget.He said there would still need to be an "adjustment" in the UK economy, but added it was "perfectly sensible to wait for a new prime minister" before taking any such action.Bank of England governor Mark Carney - who is likely to emerge as a key figure in the coming days - said some "market and economic volatility" could be expected in the wake of the Brexit vote but the Bank was well prepared. He said it stood ready to offer all necessary assistance to ensure financial stability, including £250bn of extra liquidity for the banking system and potential support for sterling.Business leaders have appealed for calm but also more clarity over how the process of leaving the EU will proceed and who will lead it. A number of firms have said they will review their investment in the UK. Sources within Morgan Stanley have told the BBC that the bank is stepping up a process which could see up to 2,000 of its London-based investment banking staff being relocated to Dublin or Frankfurt.European leaders respond

All EU leaders wanted the UK to stay in the bloc and a Leave vote has been met with disappointment and dismay across the Channel. Hastily-convened meetings are taking place in Brussels and across foreign capitals on how to deal with the fallout of the UK's decision, with the leaders of Germany, France and Italy meeting on Monday ahead of a wider EU summit later this week.European Council President Donald Tusk has appealed for unity among the EU's 27 other members, saying the vote is historic but "not a moment for hysterical reactions". German leader Angela Merkel said the vote was "regrettable" and a "watershed moment" for the EU. What will happen next is difficult to predict. A long, hard road of negotiations between the UK and EU beckons although it is unclear when this process - likely to take years - will begin.  The German government said Britain should be given a reasonable amount of time to negotiate its withdrawal.EU leaders are particularly worried about the prospect of "contagion", with the UK's decision already fuelling demands from populist, anti-EU parties in France and the Netherlands for referendums of their own on EU membership. Pushing the exit button

There is a formal legal process for withdrawing from the EU - enshrined in Article 50 of the 2009 Lisbon Treaty - although it has never been invoked before. Mr Cameron has said it should be up to his successor to decide when to activate Article 50 by notifying the European Council. Once this happens, the UK is cut out of EU decision-making at the highest level and there will be no way back unless by unanimous consent from all other member states. Quitting the EU is not an automatic process - it has to be negotiated with the remaining 27 members and ultimately approved by them by qualified majority. These negotiations are meant to be completed within two years although many believe it will take much longer. The European Parliament has a veto over any new agreement formalising the relationship between the UK and the EU.




Image caption

                    The process to take the UK out of the European Union starts with invoking Article 50 and will take at least two years from that point
                

Leave campaigners have said there is no need to trigger Article 50 immediately, suggesting that first there should be a period of informal discussions with other EU members and the European Commission to iron out the main issues and a feasible timetable.Some have even suggested that Article 50 should not be invoked until after the French presidential elections in May 2017 and the German parliamentary elections next year to avoid Brexit becoming an issue in the campaigns. The idea, they say, would be to allow other EU leaders the time to realise they need a "friendly" trade deal with the UK to continue exporting their consumer goods into the British market without tariffs. Any such trade agreement - separate to the negotiations over the "terms of divorce" - would need to be approved separately by the UK and by every remaining EU member, with Leave supporters envisaging this could be completed by 2020.Britain could, technically, ignore all of this and simply write the EU out of its laws, although that wouldn't make future negotiations any easier. The BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman says this would mean ripping up the UK's obligations under the Lisbon Treaty and therefore, while it was possible, remained very unlikely. As only one part of one country has ever left the European Community - Greenland more than 30 years ago (read Carolyn Quinn's feature on how they left) - we are in uncharted territory here. While Article 50 negotiations are taking place, the UK is bound by all existing EU laws and treaty obligations. But after two years, this would no longer be the case and British membership could cease. Remain campaigners warned this could see the UK revert to trading with the EU under World Trade Organization rules, which would involve exporters being hit by import taxes, or tariffs.Parliament will not stay silent

The process of extricating the UK from the EU will ultimately involve rescinding the 1972 European Communities Act, the brief piece of legislation that brought the country into the European Economic Community, as it was then known, and which gives primacy to EU law in the UK.It will also mean sifting through an estimated 80,000 pages of EU agreements, which have been enacted over the past five decades, to decide which will be repealed, amended or retained - a process which Parliament will want to oversee. Parliament will ultimately have to ratify the treaty authorising UK withdrawal. The majority of the UK's 650 MPs were in favour of Britain staying in the EU and while they will have to respect the will of the British people, they will not be silent bystanders. There have already been moves among the 450 or so MPs who want to stay in the EU, across the Labour, Conservative, SNP, Plaid Cymru and Green parties, to keep the UK in the single market in any exit negotiations.This, dubbed "reverse Maastricht", would mean Britain would have to keep its borders open to EU workers and continue paying into EU coffers - which is likely to be unacceptable to most of the 17 million people who voted Leave in the referendum. They say it would be legitimate for MPs to do this because the Leave campaign has refused to spell out what trading relationship it wants the UK to have with the EU in the future - and it would demonstrate the sovereignty of Parliament the Leavers were so keen to restore.Who will lead Britain's negotiations?

Then there is the question of who will do the negotiating for Britain. The most senior members of the government - David Cameron, Chancellor George Osborne, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Theresa May - are all Remain supporters and some of them may choose to depart when the PM stands down. During the campaign, the Leave side said that it would be happy for existing ministers and senior civil servants - including cabinet secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood - to lead the negotiations although they would expect senior Leave figures to play a very prominent role, as well as figures from other parties, business, law and civil society.Now, however, it seems certain the next prime minister - whoever they may be - will take charge of the process. Could this be either Boris Johnson or Michael Gove - both of whom were tipped for major promotions whatever the outcome of the vote.The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also want to be represented in the process.The UK's future up for grabs?

The Brexit vote will fuel concerns in Westminster that the future of the United Kingdom is now in serious doubt. The SNP warned during the campaign that if - as has happened - the UK overall voted to leave the EU but Scots voted to remain, Scotland would be taken out of the EU "against its will" and this could be the trigger for another independence vote.Senior SNP figures have said the vote shows Scotland sees its future in the EU and the issue of its own constitutional status could be revisited. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the issue is now back "on the table" while her predecessor Alex Salmond has gone further, saying a second vote could take place within the next two and a half years, depending on how long it takes the UK to depart.The SNP's failure to win a majority in last month's Holyrood elections means a second vote will be harder to achieve, with the UK government less disposed than it was in 2012 to accept the idea. There are, of course, no guarantees that an independent Scotland would be admitted into the EU. There are also concerns in Northern Ireland about the implications of the Brexit vote for its relationship with the Republic of Ireland. Remain campaigners warned that a Brexit vote could herald the return of "hard" border controls between the North and South. The Irish government has said the future of the border is one of a number of priority issues in its contingency planning. Sinn Fein has called for a vote on the reunification of Ireland but this has been rejected by the UK government.

Scotland: 'Indyref 2' being pushed online


By BBC Trending
What's popular and why


As the EU referendum count turned decisively towards Leave, the online conversation in Scotland immediately turned to the possibility of another vote on independence.The idea has been long been dubbed "indyref 2" and that hashtag shot to the top of Twitter's trends list shortly after the vote result became clear. Scotland voted 62% in favour of Remain.

The conversation online was being driven overwhelmingly by pro-independence campaigners. But people who had supported "Better Together" during the Scottish referendum vote also spoke about the possibility of a break-away from the UK as a result of the vote over EU membership.  Perhaps the most significant was Scottish author JK Rowling who tweeted: "Scotland will seek independence now. Cameron's legacy will be breaking up two unions. Neither needed to happen."

Many took to Twitter to express new or strengthened pro-independence feelings in the wake of the latest vote (Just as a reminder: a "Yes" vote in Scotland's 2014 referendum was for independence, while the winning "No" campaign backed staying in the UK).

One old tweet from 2014's independence referendum gained new life on Friday. Put out by the cross-party Better Together campaign, it reminded Scottish voters that the EU membership of an independent Scotland would be no sure thing:

                    How will a future UK outside of the EU treat imports from around the world?
                

After the UK voted to leave the EU, the country faces the prospect of having to establish new trade relationships - both with the remaining 27 EU members and other countries around the world.As a member of the EU, the UK has been included in trade deals the EU has negotiated. There are 22 trade agreements between the EU and individual countries, and five multi-lateral agreements covering multiple countries.This means that if the UK wants to retain preferential access to the markets of the 52 countries covered by these agreements, it would have to renegotiate trade deals with all of them.Britain is a large market, so there is a clear incentive for other countries to negotiate a deal. Advocates of Brexit argued that it would be in nobody's interest to interrupt the current trading partnerships.But which of the other models discussed as potential post-Brexit options for the UK are realistic?Read more:The UK's trade deal challengesReality Check: Who has access to the single market? Reality Check: Would UK have to make new trade deals?Reality Check: Could there be free trade without free movement?1. The Norway model Member of European Economic Area, full access to single market, obliged to make a financial contribution and accept majority of EU laws, free movement applies as it does in the EU



Media captionCould Norway model work for UK?
Norway is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) - the single market - along with the 28 current EU members, Liechtenstein and Iceland.In return for that access to the single market, it pays a contribution to the EU budget and has to sign up to all the rules of the club - including its common regulations and standards.People from across the EU are free to live and work in Norway too, but the country is exempt from EU rules on agriculture, fisheries, justice and home affairs. The downside for Norway is that it has no say over how the rules of the single market are created.Senior Leave campaigner and Tory leadership hopeful Boris Johnson wrote in the Telegraph on Sunday that the UK would continue to have access to the single market.But would this be possible while also reducing immigration and cutting costs, as many Leave campaigners want? Ireland's Finance Minister Michael Noonan has said the UK is unlikely to secure full access to the single market unless it continues to allow free movement of labour.And a senior German MP and ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, Michael Fuchs, told the BBC that it would be possible for Britain to maintain access but at a price. "The per capita fee of Norway is exactly the same as what Britain is now paying into the EU," he said. "So there won't be any savings."How Norway's relationship with the EU has split views2. The Switzerland modelMember of the European Free Trade Association but not the EEA, access to EU market governed by series of bilateral agreements, covers some but not all areas of trade, also makes a financial contribution but smaller than Norway's, doesn't have a general duty to apply EU laws but does have to implement some EU regulations to enable trade, free movement applies



Media caption Imogen Foulkes reports from Geneva: ''Swiss relations with the EU are tricky''
Switzerland has a free trade agreement with the EU and a number of agreements which give it access to the single market for most of its industries.But it does not have full access to the single market for its banking sector and other parts of the services sector, which together make up almost 80% of the UK economy.Its agreement also requires the free movement of people.The Swiss voted against joining the EEA in December 1992.Instead, the country, which sells over 50% of its exports to the EU, has agreed more than 120 bilateral agreements with Brussels, designed to secure Swiss access to Europe's markets.Switzerland contributes billions of dollars to EU projects. Its bilateral deals are now in danger of unravelling over the question of free movement of people, after a referendum two years ago went in favour of restricting the number of workers arriving from the EU. While no such restriction has yet been implemented, Brussels retaliated swiftly, stalling agreements and freezing participation in education projects.Can Switzerland show UK route to Brexit?3. The Turkey modelCustoms union with the EU, meaning no tariffs or quotas on industrial goods exported to EU countries, has to apply EU's external tariff on goods imported from outside the EU


Image copyright

Turkey is not part of the EEA or the European Free Trade Association but does - like tiny Andorra and San Marino - have a customs union with the EU.This means it faces no tariffs (taxes or duties on imports and exports) or quotas on industrial goods it sends to EU countries.The customs union does not apply to agricultural goods, or services.Turkey also has no say on the tariffs it has to impose on goods it imports from non-EU countries, as it has to apply the EU's common external tariff to those goods (and is not involved in setting it).Reality Check: Would the UK face tariffs outside the EU?Free trade area v single market - what's the difference?4. The Canada optionCeta free trade deal with the EU has yet to come into force, gets rid of most tariffs on goods, but excludes some food items and services, and stipulates need to prove where goods are made



Media captionGavin Hewitt looks at Canada's trade deal with the EU
The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (Ceta) between the EU and Canada is not yet in force, although it has been in the making for seven years.It gives Canada preferential access to the EU single market without all the obligations that Norway and Switzerland face, eliminating most trade tariffs. However, some "sensitive" food items, including eggs and chicken, are not covered by it.Canadian exporters will have to prove that their goods are entirely "made in Canada", which imposes extra costs, to prevent imports entering the EU through a "back door".The services sector is only partially covered by Ceta. Crucially, a Ceta-type deal would not give UK financial services the EU market access that they have now. It would be hard for London-based banks to get "passporting" rights for their services in the EU - rights that they value hugely now.It would also mean that firms that export to the EU would have to comply with EU product standards and technical requirements without having any say in setting them. And critics of such a plan point out that the UK has a complex web of ties to the EU - much more than Canada.Reality Check: Would Canada's deal with the EU be a good model for the UK?5. The Singapore and Hong Kong approachCity states do not impose import or export tariffs at all - a unilateral free trade approach

Some advocates of Brexit have said the UK should adopt a unilateral free trade policy - dropping all tariffs and relying on the World Trade Organisation's framework - as reported by the Financial Times. For example Hong Kong's free trade policy means the Chinese special administrative region maintains no barriers on trade. The Hong Kong government says it "does not charge tariff on importation or exportation of goods. Import and export licensing is also kept to a minimum."This approach may have some appeal to Brexiteers whose ideology favours no trade restrictions.It would be likely to gather less support from disaffected Labour voters and left-wing critics of the EU. No tariffs of any kind could have a strongly negative effect on the UK's agriculture and manufacturing sectors, as importing goods such as food and steel would in many cases be cheaper than producing them in the UK.Reality Check: Free trade free from regulation?Viewpoint: Brexit puts UK on new economic pathThe default: World Trade Organisation rulesWTO sets rules for international trade that apply to all members, no free movement or financial contribution, no obligation to apply EU laws although traded goods would still have to meet EU standards, some tariffs would be in place on trade with the EU, trade in services would be restricted


Image copyright
Reuters

If talks - with the EU and others - do not reach a deal before Brexit takes effect, trade rules would default to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.The UK and EU would be obliged to apply to each other the tariffs and other trade restrictions they apply to the rest of the world. That is because the WTO rules allow countries to discriminate in favour of a trade partner only in a limited number of circumstances - including a full bilateral trade deal.







Media captionEU referendum: A tale of two votes
The vote in England exposed huge differences in the level of support for the Remain and Leave campaigns in London and the rest of the country.Boston in south Lincolnshire recorded the highest leave vote in the UK, with 75.6% backing Brexit. The borough of Lambeth in south London saw almost the reverse result, with 78.6% of voters supporting Remain.The BBC visited the two boroughs at polar opposites of the European Union referendum.

                    In Boston, 7,430 (24.4%) voted to remain, while 22,974 (75.6%) voted to leave the EU
                

At the scene in Boston: David Sykes, BBC NewsThe vote comes against the backdrop of local concerns over the number of migrant workers in the town, and the increased pressure on local services.Many are from Eastern Europe, attracted by work in the agricultural industry.Among those obviously pleased with the result was a street sweeper driving his vehicle past a group of UKIP councillors at 6am, and giving a smile which was accompanied by a thumbs-up sign.It was a sentiment shared by many voters in one of the UK's most extreme examples of a town affected by recent EU immigration. The only other people in the town's market square were small groups of people waiting for a lift to work. Every one of them hailed from Eastern Europe, and this is a common sight in this town.Yvetta from Lithuania spoke to reporters as she waited for her bus to work.She said: "What happened, happened", while her friend, Martinez questioned what the government would do with people, like him, who come from other countries.He added: "I hope it will be all right, but we don't know. Now we are waiting."Other foreign visitors offered a different perspective on the result.

Fredrick Meon from French TV station ARTE, which was filming in Boston, said: "In France, reaction is a bit polarised, divided but basically happy that the British will leave. Economically, I think Britain will suffer for the next few years... some countries of the EU will see some benefits of this and I think France could be one of them."Recent surges in migration to Boston mean that an estimated 14% of people in the area were born in other EU countries, and that may be a reason why some of the more than three-quarters of people here voted Leave.

Protests have been held in the town about the level of overseas workers, despite the local unemployment rate being below the national average, at 4.4%, as against 5.2% nationally.The town's Conservative MPs Matt Warman, who supported Remain, said: "We've got to respect the fact that if people want to take that gamble then we have to get the best deal for the country... ultimately what is in everyone's interest is a stable economy in a time of transition."However, for those expecting things to happen immediately, they might be disappointed - this new dawn, in true European style, is likely to take some time.At the scene in Brixton, Lambeth: Clark Ainsworth, BBC NewsOn the streets of Brixton there was sadness, disappointment, anger and even calls for London to secede from the UK, following the vote to leave Europe.Finding anyone who backed Brexit in an area where four out of five people supported the Remain campaign was almost impossible.Many shoppers, stallholders and residents in this ethnically diverse, but increasingly gentrified area of south London, expressed frustration that despite overwhelmingly voting to stay in the European Union, immigration concerns elsewhere in the UK meant they would be removed from the EU.

Vernon Ray first came to Lambeth from Jamaica in 1959 to work for London Transport. He says the referendum result is the "worst thing that could happen in the history of Britain"."Now everything is going to be way over the top. We're going to have to pay back through the nose."It's very upsetting."Lambeth became cosmopolitan and that is one of the reasons [it voted to remain]."The issue is immigration, and this why they [the UK] opted out but in three or four months' time they will realise the mistake they've made."

Midwives Olivia Snowball and Rebecca Manners were concerned about the impact of the vote on London."I'm really gutted that we've left," said Ms Snowball."Having spoken to all of my friends and seeing what my friends on Facebook and Twitter were saying, it just seemed to be overwhelmingly that we would stay but obviously that's not what everyone else thought."Ms Manners said: "Absolutely gutted that we voted out. "I think there's definitely going to be a drop in the housing market throughout London, which some people will say is a positive thing. "But I think that the immediate effects will be quite negative and again, especially within the NHS, I think we are going to see big changes throughout there as well."

Italian Camilla Cabasso expects Britain to experience an immediate and a long-term change for the worse. She was not eligible to vote, but when I asked her what she thought of the referendum result she shrugged her shoulders and sighed."It's not so positive for people that come from other parts of Europe."She believes the UK could become "more about control" because it would now not work together with other European countries.Another Italian, who works at a sourdough pizza restaurant, said the result made her feel as though "the UK doesn't want me to stay here".



Millions of people have voted in a historic referendum on whether the UK should remain a member of the European Union or leave.  Here we look back at the events in pictures.

                    The rig is towed away from the rocks
                

Transocean Winner, the rig that grounded on a west Lewis beach two weeks ago, has begun to be towed round the island by two tugs.The 17,000-tonne structure was refloated on a high tide at 22:04.The tugs Union Bear and Union Princess are towing the rig to the east side of Lewis.The journey to Broad Bay covers about 54 miles (87km) and could take up to 21 hours to complete.




Image caption

                    Transocean Winner was blown ashore two weeks ago
                





Once in Broad Bay, underwater inspections of the rig will be made to check for damage.Transocean Winner could remain in the bay until mid-September to allow for repairs and a decision on its final destination.




Image caption

                    Hugh Shaw, who is overseeing the salvage operation, said the rig could be anchored off Lewis for several weeks
                

The rig was being towed from Norway to Malta, from where it was to be moved to a yard in Turkey to be scrapped, when it broke free from a tug in a storm and was blown on to the shore at Dalmore, near Carloway.From BBC Scotland reporter Huw Williams, at Dalmore near CarlowayIt's the incongruity of it all.  The giant orange rig at a jaunty angle at the end of a typically gorgeous Hebridean beach, of course. As you drive down to the scene there's an orange helicopter parked on a drive just outside one of the houses, branded with a company name from the Pyrenees. Then there's the cluster of emergency services. Police. Ambulance. Coastguard. The Salvation Army. Well, get so many people together working so hard, and they'll need support, teas and coffees. And at sea, just a couple of hundred metres off the beach, the tugs and barges that should move the TransOcean Winner at high tide tonight. Zipping between them, a couple of fast RIBs.VIDEO: Watch here as Huw Williams tweets footage from the scene.Hugh Shaw, the Secretary of State's Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention, who is overseeing the salvage operation, said everything was done to prepare for a successful refloat.He told BBC Alba that before being towed to Broad Bay, the rig would first be moved about five miles (8km) offshore from where it ran aground. 




Image caption

                    Up to 100 people gathered at a viewing area at Carloway beach hoping to watch the rig refloated and towed
                

This would allow for checks to its buoyancy and stability before the longer towing operation. Mr Shaw said eight anchors were to be used to hold Transocean Winner in Broad Bay in "any weather conditions".

Former BBC DJ Chris Denning has pleaded guilty to 21 child sex offences committed between 1969 and 1986.The 75-year-old, from London, admitted the abuse of 11 boys as young as eight. He denied three other offences.Denning, who was arrested in a police inquiry into the Walton Hop Disco for teenagers in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, will be sentenced on 6 October.He was part of the original line-up that launched Radio 1 in 1967, but left two years later.The prosecution said it did not intend to proceed with a trial on the three charges to which Denning had pleaded not guilty.He is currently serving a 13-year jail term for sexual assaults against 24 victims aged nine to 16 from the 1960s to 1980s. He will be sentenced at Southwark Crown Court by the same judge who jailed him for those offences in 2014.What charges did he face?The latest offences Denning admitted included indecent assaults on men and boys and inciting boys aged under 16 and 14 to commit acts of gross indecency.  The offences he denied were three counts of indecent assault.Surrey Police said the case against the former DJ formed was part of its Operation Ravine investigation into non-recent sexual offences linked to the Walton Hop Disco which ran between 1958 and 2001.Det Ch Ins Jo Hayes said: "Denning, who was looked up to and sometimes idolised by many young people, has used his status to prey on innocent children which he has now admitted to."Four of Denning's victims were in court to see him plead guilty.Det Ch Insp Hayes said: "The four boys who Denning abused had moved on with their lives and were now adult men with families and careers. Often, they had not spoken to those closest to them about their ordeal as a child and only recently, as part of this investigation, have been able to do so..."We can never go back and take away the abuse these four men suffered as boys but I hope, in some way, today's guilty plea brings some closure for them."How famous was Chris Denning?

                    Chris Denning, circled in this picture, was among Radio 1 DJs pictured when the station launched in 1967
                

Chris Denning rose to prominence in the 1960s on BBC television and radio.He was one of the first announcers heard on BBC Two when the channel began broadcasting in 1964 and went on to be one of the original Radio 1 DJs.Denning helped launch the careers of the Bay City Rollers and Gary Glitter, and ran his own music and video production business.He remained a well-known DJ and presenter into the early 1970s.The allegations that led to his conviction in 2014 arose after the sex abuse perpetrated by late Radio 1 DJ Jimmy Savile came to light.Denning's arrest was under the strand of the investigation into offences not connected to Savile, but the court heard he did use his fame to "entice" boys.  This included taking some victims to recordings of Top of the Pops, and in other instances, introducing them to celebrities including Savile. Denning had a number of previous convictions for abusing young boys. In 1974, he was convicted of gross indecency and indecent assault but was not imprisoned.He was then jailed for 18 months in 1985 for gross indecency, and in 1988 he received a three-year sentence, this time for indecent assault and possession of indecent images.In 1996, he was handed a 10-week sentence for publishing indecent articles.He was arrested in the Czech Republic in 1997 and eventually jailed in 2000 by a Prague court for four and a half years for having sexual contact with underage teenage boys.

The UK tried and failed to have Denning extradited from the Czech Republic, but in 2005 he was arrested at Heathrow Airport, having arrived from Austria.In January 2006, a British court jailed him for four years after he admitted five charges of indecent assault on boys under 16 during the 1970s and 80s. He was then extradited to Slovakia, where he was given a five-year sentence in 2008 for producing indecent images of children.

A British citizen has been killed in Iraq trying to defuse a bomb left by the so-called Islamic State group, US contractor Janus says.Another worker is said to have been hurt clearing ordnance in Ramadi, 60 miles (100km) west of Baghdad.Iraqi forces backed by coalition air strikes retook the city from IS last December, but mine-clearing has to be completed before residents can return. The Foreign Office said it was in contact with Janus following the death. According to the AFP news agency, the incident was also confirmed by the mayor of Ramadi, although he did not specify the nationality of the wounded contractor.The incident is said to have taken place in the al-Malaab neighbourhood of Ramadi, the capital of the western Anbar province.A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are in contact with the employer of a British national who has died in Iraq and have offered our support at this difficult time." Dozens of Iraqi civilians have died in explosions while trying to return to their homes in the city. Janus Global Operations began its work in April after being awarded the contract to clear thousands of devices and booby-traps left by IS.It confirmed the death of the British contractor without providing further information.

A "bully" grabbed a schoolboy by the throat and called a teenage girl a "whore" after spotting them cuddling in east London, a court has heard.Michael Coe, 35, stopped driving and allegedly confronted the 16-year-olds, demanding to know if they were Muslims.When they lied and told him they were not, he grabbed the boy around the neck before throwing him to the floor.At Southwark Crown Court Mr Coe, a Muslim, denied assault occasioning actual bodily harm and battery.He admitted assaulting the 16-year-old boy in Wilson Road, Newham, on 15 April but claims it was self-defence.'Blood on my face'The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the court he was hugging his girlfriend goodbye when Mr Coe shouted "let that little schoolgirl go".He said Mr Coe grabbed him by the throat, causing him to black out.He said: "I woke up - there was blood on my hands and I could feel blood on my face, my head was throbbing and I was very dizzy and also felt sick." The court heard schoolteacher Boutho Siwela went over to help the pair when Mr Coe also allegedly attacked him.Prosecutor Jonathan Polnay told the jury: "This case is about what started as unpleasant bullying with religious overtones in the street, followed by an attack by this 35-year-old man on a 16-year-old schoolboy."This was completely unpleasant and utterly unwarranted - this is a grown man on a child."

                    Robert Kerr admitted killing his wife Xin Xin Liu at their home in East Renfrewshire
                

A college lecturer has admitting killing his wife in "a stabbing frenzy" after wrongly believing he was not the father of their two children.Robert Kerr, 39, inflicted 76 wounds on 39-year-old Xin Xin Liu at their home in Newton Mearns, East Renfrewshire.The Crown accepted his plea to culpable homicide on the grounds of diminished responsibility after it emerged he suffered "an abnormality of the mind".Kerr will remain at the State Hospital under an interim compulsion order.



At the High Court in Glasgow, judge Lord Boyd imposed the interim compulsion order for Kerr to remain at Carstairs and the case was adjourned until November.The court heard that Xin Xin had moved to Scotland from China around 15 years ago to study law at Aberdeen University.It was there she met Kerr, who was completing a computer course. They were married in 2003.Kerr was latterly a lecturer at West College Scotland in Paisley, while Xin Xin was training to be a translator.'Paranoid feelings' They were described as a "quiet and private couple" with family not aware of any problems between them.In April this year - weeks before the killing - Kerr had contacted his GP complaining of stress in respect of "work and personal issues".He added he was suffering from anxiety, insomnia and spoke about "paranoid feelings".Four days before the attack, Kerr spoke to a nurse and said he had been feeling much better and appeared to be sounding "chirpier".



The court heard that on 26 April, however, Kerr attacked Xin Xin as their two sons slept upstairs.Just before midnight, he dialled 999 and admitted: "I have just killed my wife. I murdered her in a stabbing frenzy."He went on to state there was "blood all over the place".Police discovered Xin Xin lying on the kitchen floor with a knife still in her body.After being held, Kerr then told officers: "I found out tonight they were not mine."Paternity testProsecutor Jane Farquharson said he had "suspicions" that a friend was the father of his children.Ms Farquharson told the court: "A paternity test recently carried out...has since confirmed that Robert Kerr is the biological father."A number of blood-stained items were found at the couple's house, including a milk carton.The advocate depute said: "Kerr has since admitted that he had made himself a hot drink after this incident."A post mortem later revealed Xin Xin had suffered a total of 76 wounds. The court heard that Kerr had since been receiving treatment at the State Hospital at Carstairs.One doctor concluded that his "ability to control his conduct" that night was "substantially impaired by reason of abnormality of mind".He was said to be suffering from a "delusional disorder" including his belief about the paternity of his children.

                    Trevor Baker was a familiar face on ITV weather bulletins for southern England
                

Pioneering TV weatherman Trevor Baker has died at the age of 94, ITV has announced.Nicknamed Trevor the Weather, he began his broadcasting career with the BBC before presenting weather bulletins on Southern Television and TVS throughout the 1960s, 70s and 80s.ITV said he had been a "much loved" presenter.A family statement said he died at his home in London following a short illness.Swansea-born Baker joined the Met Office at the age of 18 before serving with the RAF during World War Two.In the early 1960s he began his TV career with the BBC before joining Southern Television in Southampton as a regular presenter on the Day by Day programme and was later given his own show - The Trevor Baker All Weather Show.Because of his Welsh origins, he soon established the nickname Trevor the Weather although to many viewers he was simply known as Trevor.He continued appearing on the Coast to Coast regional news programme after TVS took over the ITV franchise for southern England. After his retirement in 1987 he spent 20 years working as a volunteer at Southampton General Hospital, taking a confectionery trolley around the wards.

Media captionThe speaking clock: 80 years of accuracy
A competition to become the new voice of the speaking clock has been launched.Telecoms company BT is running the UK-wide contest to mark the 80th anniversary of the telephone service, which receives 12 million calls a year.The winner will be only the fifth person to give the time "at the third stroke" when people dial 123.Sara Mendes da Costa has been the voice of the speaking clock since winning the last competition in 2007. Previous voices have included an actor and a London telephone exchange supervisor.Listen to the current speaking clockAt the third stroke... Why do people still dial for the time?The speaking clock service provides the precise time, announced every 10 seconds at any time of day or night. It began on 24 July 1936 as a service for people who did not have a watch or clock to hand.

Before 1936, people used to ring the exchange operator - a real person - to settle a dispute over the time.Now officially called Timeline, the speaking clock has never been a free service - in the early days, calls were one penny from home and tuppence from a phone box. 'Iconic service'It now costs 45p a minute from a BT landline, and still experiences peak periods on Remembrance Day, New Year's Eve and when the clocks go forwards or back.Ms Mendes da Costa, who will be one of the competition's judges, said she was sad her time as the voice of the "iconic service" was coming to an end, but "10 years is not a bad run". "And it'll be great to be on the judging panel to choose the new voice, just as my predecessor Brian Cobby helped choose me," she said.

The speaking clock gets its time from the atomic clocks at the National Physical Laboratory, the UK's official time-keeper.To celebrate the 80th anniversary of the service, BT is donating the original speaking clock machines from 1936 and 1963 to the British Horological Institute.The competition, which is being run in partnership with the BBC's The One Show in aid of Children in Need 2016, is open to anyone aged 10 or over. Details of how to apply are available on the BBC One Show website. The competition closes at 22:00 BST on Monday 29 August 2016, with the winner to be announced in November.

                    Richard Bilton has been tracking the effect of austerity cuts in his local town Selby for months
                

Selby is a tidy market town sitting in the flat, open countryside south of York.On market days, stalls cover the square of my local town in front of the old abbey and the car parks are full.Wander through the tight streets and it's hard to see that anything is different - it looks and feels the same as it always has - but a silent revolution is under way. Since 2010, national spending on local government has halved and all of our communities are having to make do with less.In Selby, the police cells and magistrates court have been closed, CCTV and bus services have been cut back, street wardens have been axed and many of the street lights turn off at midnight. And a voluntary army is at work.On the outskirts of the town, Terry Heselton manages a team of volunteers who run Barlby library - which would have closed without their efforts. 




Image caption

                    Library volunteer Terry Heselton initially feared accusations that they were taking people's jobs
                

"Most people would prefer it if the council could carry on providing the library service, but in the real world that's simply not going to happen," he says.  Nationally, the number of library volunteers has almost doubled since 2010. It is a new model of civic provision and it brings savings, but Terry says he had doubts. "Your initial reaction as a group of volunteers is 'we're taking people's jobs, aren't we?' And I'm sure there are some people who still think that, but at the end of the day, I think we now know year-on-year, there's increasing cuts. We're never going to go back to running things the way they used to be."North Yorkshire County Council funds many of the services in Selby, but its spending power is shrinking by a third.The council has already saved £116m and it says it has done what it can to protect frontline services, with 60% of the savings found in the back office and more than 100 managers leaving.

                    Gary Fielding accepts the cuts have changed services in the town
                

Gary Fielding has to make the figures work. He says the first cuts were genuine efficiency improvements, but it's got harder."You go for the low-hanging fruit, you then grasp for the medium-height fruit and we're now getting the stepladders out and really climbing up that tree," he says."We will always provide essential services to the most vulnerable, but change has got to happen - even on frontline services."Isolated peopleEighty-year-old Jean Collins volunteers in the Age UK Selby District offices in the town centre. The council used to pay for workers at the charity to visit isolated elderly people in their homes as part of a befriending scheme, but funding has now been redistributed to other Age UK organisations in Yorkshire and other befriending services in the town.The charity can now only afford to pay for a phone line in the office.

                    Selby resident Betty says elderly people like her are not getting the help they need
                

One person affected by the changes is 87-year-old Betty McIntyre, who lives on her own in the village of Brayton, just outside Selby. She had a fall last year and has been confined to a chair in her living room for seven months. In one recent call, she told Jean: "I've been crying my eyes out because I've been so upset. All the painkillers - it's not doing me any good."She understands why the visits have become phone calls but says: "You feel closer to the people who are coming to visit you than [those who talk] on the phone, you get a picture of them." Betty is worried about how the cuts affect people in her age group and says they can't get the help they need.Find out more

Selby has a Conservative MP, Nigel Adams, and District and County Councils with Tory majorities. Like voters across the country, people here chose a government which promised to balance the books, but that means changes to basic services.With the closure of the police cells, anyone arrested has to be taken to York - 15 miles away. In time, the station building itself is expected to shut and the police will move into the council building.There are 161 fewer officers in North Yorkshire than there were in 2010. The local police force has lost about £10m from its £147m annual budget and it too is making more use of volunteers.In the village of Eggborough, south of Selby, the police station is only open to the public thanks to the unpaid locals who staff the desk.

The volunteers also patrol the countryside looking for crime, wearing police-style uniforms and driving a sponsored car."We're just another [pair of] eyes and ears for the police service, because rural crime covers a big, big area and it is a little bit difficult to police it. We're not there to take their role," says Steve Barker, who has volunteered since December 2014. Their work is overseen by force control and North Yorkshire Police say the volunteers aren't used to replace funded services.But they are part of a new civic order. Volunteers have always supported communities - but here in Selby they are increasingly at the heart of important services.It's the same story across the country: life is changing in communities as everyone tries to save money wherever they can.

Spider silk has been used to create a superlens for a microscope, allowing scientists to view objects previously deemed "invisible".Physical laws of light make it impossible to view structures smaller than 200 nanometers - the smallest size of bacteria - using a normal microscope alone.But scientists from Bangor and Oxford universities found the silk lets them see beyond the current magnification.The discovery was hailed as "exciting".Bangor University said extending the limit of the classical microscope's resolution had been the "Holy Grail" of microscopy for over a century and superlenses had been the goal since the turn of the millennium. Manufactured superlenses have previously been used but this is believed to be the first time a naturally occurring biological material had been used to create one.The team found applying the dragline silk of a golden silk orb-weaver spider to the material being viewed provided an additional two to three times magnification.This allowed them to view structures previously classed as "invisible", including some germs and viruses.

 The findings have been published in a paper in the nanoscience research journal Nano Letters. Dr Zengbo Wang, who led Bangor's team, said producing manufactured superlenses involved some complex engineering processes and finding a natural superlens was important "so that everyone can access superlenses".Prof Fritz Vollrath, whose silk group at Oxford University's department of zoology collaborated on the project, said it was "very exciting"."These lenses could be used for seeing and viewing previously 'invisible' structures, including engineered nano-structures and biological micro-structures as well as, potentially, native germs and viruses," he said."In much the same was as when you look through a cylindrical glass or bottle, the clearest image only runs along the narrow strip directly opposite your line of vision, or resting on the surface being viewed, the single filament provides a one-dimensional viewing image along its length."The golden silk orb-weaver spider - often called Nephila or banana spiders - are known for the impressive webs they weave and are found in warmer regions around the world.



Six people died around the UK and Channel Islands coastline in a series of incidents at the weekend.The deaths included a man who was swept off rocks in Cornwall and a mother and son who died in the sea off Aberdeen. So what are the greatest risks at the seaside and can they be avoided?



Should you stick to beaches with a lifeguard?



The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) urges people to "respect the water and visit a lifeguarded beach".This year, the RNLI has lifeguards on 238 beaches across the UK and the Channel Islands.It says "seconds count" in emergencies at the beach - and its lifeguards responded to more than 17,000 incidents last year. "For the best chance of survival, you need someone on the beach who can see the dangers develop: someone who can prevent accidents before they happen and respond instantly if they occur," it says.



What do the flags mean?

The area between two red and yellow flags (top picture) is patrolled by lifeguards and is the safest place to swim, bodyboard and use inflatables, the RNLI says
Areas between black and white chequered flags (see above) are for watersports like surfing and kayaking. People should not swim in these areas
An orange windsock (also above) denotes strong or offshore winds. The RNLI says inflatables should not be used in these conditions
A red flag means it is dangerous to go in the water




What is a rip current?

Image caption

                    A rip current can move faster than an Olympic swimmer
                

Basically, a rip current is a narrow channel of fast-moving water."Rips can be very difficult to spot, but sometimes can be identified by a channel of churning, choppy water or debris on the sea's surface," the RNLI says. These can be dangerous because they can drag people out to sea, and can reach up to 4.5mph (7.2km/h). That may not sound fast, but it's quicker than Team GB swimmer Adam Peaty's world-record pace in the 100m breaststroke at the Rio Olympics. 



What should you do if you get into trouble?



Keep calm, raise your hand and shout for help.If it's a rip current, don't swim against it. As explained above, it's almost impossible to swim faster than a powerful rip, so attempting this will lead to exhaustion.Stand rather than swim if the water is shallow enough. If not, swim parallel to the shore until free of the rip, then head for shore. If you find yourself in the water unexpectedly, the initial shock may cause you to gasp and panic. The RNLI advises people in this situation not to attempt swimming straight away, but to relax, float and try to find something buoyant before swimming towards safety if possible.



What if you see someone else in trouble?



Call 999 and ask for the Coastguard.If you have something that floats or something the struggling person can hold on to, throw it to them.The RNLI says: "Don't go in the water yourself - too many people drown trying to save others."



What do you need to know about tides?

Many coastal emergencies happen when people get cut off by rising water.Visitors are advised to check tides before walking along beaches, as well as watching out for signs about hazards such as falling rocks. Tide timetables are available from the BBC.



When should you stay away from the sea?

"Respect the water," says RNLI lifeguard manager Kester Sheppard."It's like a fire. If you could see a fire burning, you wouldn't walk towards it would you?"He says many people who go near the sea in rough weather - for example, to take pictures - get caught out by an unexpectedly large wave, and he urges: "Don't go too close."What is safe will depend on the conditions, but people should be aware of the risks and follow any advice from nearby signs and authorities, Mr Sheppard adds.



What are the other key safety rules?




Never swim alone
Supervise children at all times
Don't go in the sea after drinking alcohol
Don't jump from height into the sea (known as tombstoning)

                    The boats will take part in a race at the Crom Estate on Saturday
                

A race involving traditional wooden boats has taken place on Lough Erne for the first time in more than a century.Cots were once the main mode of transport around the Fermanagh lakelands.In the early 1900s they brought people, livestock and goods across the water.Now Lough Erne Heritage, which was formed last year to revive interest in the history of traditional boats, has built and launched two new cots.The boats took part in a race at the Crom Estate near Newtownbutler on Saturday.




Image caption

                    The cots were launched on Lough Erne on Friday
                

The group's chairman Fred Ternan said cots have been used on Lough Erne for "possibly 2,000 years" and that they were once as familiar a sight in the area as cars on roads today."All the activity and all the life around the lough depended so much on boats and obviously the boat builders were an essential part of it as well," he said."There are a number of fundamentals in a cot's design - the bottom is flat and the two ends slope up and each of those sections is roughly the same size. 




Image caption

                    The boats took three months to build by volunteers from Cavan Town Men's Shed
                

 "Originally when the cots were built, the bottoms were made first and then planks were put on the side and then the crutches were made from bent branches and they were found on trees and cut off and put in to support the structure."The two new cots took three months to build by volunteers from Cavan Town Men's Shed, including Peter O'Hanlon.

                    Cots were once the main mode of transport around the Fermanagh lakelands
                

"Through building the cot, we're learning age-old traditions - 100 years old or more," he said."We're learning how to work the wood, understanding how boats are built, how specifically cot boats are built which were specific to the Erne. "We're learning all new skills, but they're so old, but they're new to us - it's fabulous."Bert Robinson from Lough Erne Heritage said they used specifications on a drawing of a cot that was used on Upper Lough Erne by Bernadette Began, the former principal of Wattlebridge Primary School.

Mr Robinson said she told them it was a very stable vessel in the water. "She went across as a young girl with her father to land which was across water," he said. "They milked the cows on the farm across the water and they took the buckets of milk across every day and made sure that they didn't as much as spill one drop of milk."The new cots were launched by Lord Erne, whose family have lived in Crom Castle and have a long association with the boats. Lord Erne said the two new boats were "wonderful". "Growing up at Crom, living at Crom, we've known nothing else but the Lough Erne cot," he said.

"My sisters got married from it, we took my late father over for his funeral in it in December, so it means a lot and it's lovely to see it being reinvented."Fred Ternan hopes to reintroduce cot racing on Lough Erne. "With the two cots now that we have built we will be able to demonstrate cot rowing or pulling as it's known, how they can be brought in ashore and goods put on to them, how they can be used for racing, because the cots actually were raced and there were regular cot regattas for racing." On Saturday, Lough Erne Heritage recreated what is known as the "famous cot race" that took place at Crom in 1856.The winners turned down the prize money on offer and instead asked Lord Erne to help arrange the return of their parish priest.

                    It is hoped that cot racing will become a regular event on Lough Erne
                

Fr Clarke had fled to America after being told he was going to be arrested for officiating in a mixed marriage. Lord Erne was able to get the charges dropped and the priest came back to serve out his days in Newtownbutler. Now that their boat building project has been completed, Peter O'Hanlon said the Cavan Town Men's Shed would have to come up with a new project. "You spend all this time and put a huge amount of energy into actually building the boat and that's where the fun is and the craic is and the slagging and all the rest, and then you see the boat in the water and it's brilliant. "But then it's finished, so where to next?"When asked whether they would build another cot he laughs: "Possibly, or maybe two!"

Wimbledon underdog Marcus Willis has coached at his home tennis club for the first time since his match against seven-times winner Roger Federer.Willis, of Warwick Boat Club Tennis Club, was the world number 772, but played Federer on Centre Court after coming through six rounds of qualifying and the first round proper. About 70 people attended a free session to allow non-members to try the sport.The event was set up in a bid to make tennis less elitist, the club said.Willis, 25, from Warwick, who is now the world number 420, said his life had "completely changed since those two weeks" at Wimbledon.He said: "I got on an aeroplane [at Atlanta]. The security guard looked at me and went 'Willis. I know who you are'."The story has gone global... everywhere [you get] 'this was the guy who played Roger Federer on Centre Court'."I'm getting a lot more offers."

 Willis, who is away on tour for up to 30 weeks a year, said since Wimbledon he had played for the New York Empire team in World Team Tennis, which included doubles action alongside former world number one Andy Roddick.He said he would be making personal appearances and going to exhibition events when he was not competing. Club tennis manager Gavin Henderson said Willis was a coach who was "so enthusiastic" and did it "with a smile on his face". He said: "It's better for us to have someone like him than someone like Roger Federer, for instance."[He's] not just around for one day or a week. He's here for the next few years." The free Sunday afternoon sessions for non-members were set up in a bid to make tennis "more welcoming," the club said.It said they usually attract more than 20 people and would carry on for as long as they were popular.

One year on from the Shoreham air crash, those who witnessed the horror of what happened that day - and who in some cases narrowly avoided being killed themselves - have been recalling their experiences.In the 12 months since the disaster, in which 11 people died as a vintage Hawker Hunter jet plunged into traffic on to the A27, bystanders have spoken of sleepless nights and difficulties in coping with what they saw.These are their stories.

It was like someone punched me.  "I ran upstairs and shouted to my wife Lyn that something had happened. We looked out of the bedroom window and saw the smoke."

                    The crash left a trail of debris on the A27
                

Web designer Neil Lewer, 49, remembered the site as "like a warzone, bits of debris, grey misty smoke and road signs peppered with bits of shrapnel".He had driven his wife, daughter and one of his sons to the air show from their home in Redhill. He said: "We go down there every year. If we'd been sitting in the same spot as last time, we would've been killed. "We had been there about an hour on the grass verge with our camping chairs, a parasol, blankets and a packed lunch."When the Hawker came over, he pulled up and banked. I lost sight of him behind the bushes."I was starting to crouch down when I heard this loud 'whompf'. Then this fireball and wreckage was going past 20ft from us. "We were stood transfixed in a state of shock. My daughter was screaming and we ran about 30m to the access road."We were in a daze as we rushed back to our car, I noticed my shirt was badly damaged, so I threw it off."He added: "I don't think air shows should be banned but my wife will never go to another one. "It's difficult, people who go to air shows as spectators appreciate there's a bit of risk, but not those killed in the cars."

Photographer and aviation enthusiast Terry Smith, 60, from Worthing, said he has had "long sleepless nights" since witnessing the crash with his eight-year-old daughter.He had persuaded her to go to watch the show and met an old friend, taking photos of the displays while their girls played."The Hunter was pretty low and fast and banked up into the sky. I lost sight of it and knew in that instance it was going to go terribly wrong and couldn't believe what was happening. "You knew it was blowing up. It was frightening. The wreckage came to a rest just opposite, a road's width. Then there was this fireball heading towards us at 400mph. "The heat was burning our skin, it was that hot. My only thought was to protect my daughter. I pushed her back to the bushes and put myself between her and the heat.  I got hit on the leg by a small fragment of debris and was in pain for days. "You could see loads of tiny bits from the wreckage. There was one car with the top sliced off. I knew I couldn't do anything for them."My daughter said 'Daddy I want to go home'. As we walked back, we looked at the sky and saw smoke from the fireball dispersing in the wind, like a spider tattoo."She didn't talk about it at all. A few months ago I was thinking of going to the Farnborough air show and was talking in code with my wife. "Our daughter heard us and said: 'It's OK we can talk about Shoreham now'."

Freelance photographer Eddie Mitchell had gone to the air show to work for a local paper and the BBC."I was in the press area when it happened. Nobody really knew where the crash was and didn't realise a plane had bounced in the road."The organisers told everyone to sit tight and let the emergency services do their thing."Nobody knew it was as horrendous as it was. A lot of people were getting frustrated as they didn't know the main exit road was blocked."He reached the crash site and realised the large loss of life."You could tell from the way the emergency services were acting that the decimation was so bad and there wasn't much they could do. "It was so horrific, the firefighters having to step over bodies. You couldn't imagine what had happened."Some of us there would have suffered post-traumatic stress. I haven't been to an air show since. It would be macabre if I saw another plane doing manoeuvres."

Footballer Matt Grimstone was driving team-mate Jacob Schilt in his car to a match at Worthing United FC when the plane came down, killing them both.Club secretary and vice-chairman Mark Sanderson recalls the moment he and manager Nigel Geary suddenly feared the worst. After preparing the pitch in the morning, Mr Sanderson was driving back to the ground when he saw a plume of black smoke and heard a radio travel report about an incident on the A27."We were getting phone calls from players delayed in the traffic."Some arrived but we hadn't heard from Matt or Jacob. Nigel tried to ring them and it was unusual for their phones to go to voicemail."Then some people were seeing videos of the crash on YouTube and Nigel came up to me ashen-faced, saying: 'Look at this'. "One of the clips showed Matt's car. It's then we thought something terrible had happened."It was at some point on Sunday afternoon when their families gave us permission to release their names."

Cargo ships sailing near the site of a historically significant shipwreck have caused its condition to deteriorate rapidly in the last year, divers say.The London sank off Southend-on-Sea, Essex, after an explosion in 1665.A charitable trust has been set up to preserve the "unique" wreck and the artefacts found on board.Trustee Steve Ellis said in the past 12 months, ships heading to the London Gateway development had affected the wreck "more than ever before"."The wreck is deteriorating rapidly, we're noticing it on a weekly basis. We're trying to recover as much as we can," he said."You wouldn't let a site like this on land deteriorate like it is, so we formed a trust to try to protect it."

The ship sank on its way to fight the Dutch, killing about 300 crew.The wreckage of The London was only discovered because of dredging works during construction of the port's shipping channels in 2005. Southend Borough Councillor Georgina Phillips said she would like to form a "positive relationship" with DP World, the company that operates London Gateway."We're hoping to build the relationship to the point where they might donate towards the wreck," she said."If we can't get the big container ships stopped, the company might be able to help in another way and make something positive out of it."Mr Ellis, a licensed diver, said the quality of finds from the wreckage had so far been "absolutely outstanding", and the trust had been formed to protect, preserve and eventually display the items.

The claim: On some days Oxford Street in London is the world's most polluted street.Reality Check verdict: This was true of Nitrogen Dioxide pollution in 2013. But on average in 2014, Brixton Road in Lambeth was worse than Oxford Street.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan told Radio 4's Today Programme on Friday: "Oxford Street on some days of the year is the most polluted street in the world."He unveiled a plan to deal with London's pollution problems last month.His claim comes from research by King's College London, and it only refers to one pollutant: Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2).NO2 pollution is mainly caused by diesel traffic and most of Oxford Street is only open to buses and taxis, which means a very high proportion of the traffic is using diesel.Also, researchers at King's explain that a high proportion of the bus fleet on Oxford Street uses technology that burns off sooty particles but at the cost of increasing NO2 emissions.In 2014, which is the latest full year for which data is available, Oxford Street had an average of 143 micrograms of NO2 per cubic metre and there were 1,532 hours during the year when that figure was above 200, although there were gaps in the data collected from Oxford Street. The EU limit based on World Health Organisation guidelines is that the average NO2 should be below 40 micrograms per cubic metre and there should be no more than 18 occasions when that figure is above 200. In 2013, researchers at King's said that average NO2 levels on Oxford Street were clearly the highest in Europe and that data available in the rest of the world suggested there were unlikely to be higher levels anywhere else, particularly because the heightened levels of NO2 were being caused by particular types of diesel engines.  But in 2014, Brixton Road in Lambeth was even worse, with an average of 153 micrograms per cubic metre, and 2001 hours above the 200 microgram limit. So there may have been days when Oxford Street had the highest level of NO2 in the world, but overall, in 2014 Brixton Road in Lambeth was worse. The final report for 2015 is not yet out, but from the raw data it seems that Oxford Street was back in top spot, although this time there are gaps in the data from Brixton Road.







It was in January of this year that a 20-year-old Muslim woman of Turkish origin visited her bank, a Sparkasse branch in the western German city of Neuss, near Düsseldorf. The woman was wearing a niqab, a full-body veil that leaves only the eyes exposed -- and even before she could approach the cash desks, an employee blocked her path. He cited the ban on face-coverings in the branch and pointed to the sign at the entrance showing an image of a crossed-out motorcycle helmet.


The client, who had once before been prevented from entering the bank on the strength of the regulation, offered to lift her veil -- but only in a separate room and only in front of a female bank employee. But that wasn't possible, because only male employees were working that day. A conflict ensued and the Muslim woman left the bank without completing her transaction. Her husband, who was born in Germany and had been a customer at the Sparkasse for years, was indignant: Since the encounter, he claims, his wife has been distraught.
Some conservative politicians in Germany have recently said they would like to see the Sparkasse approach adopted across the country: Down with the veils. They argue that facial veils, like in France, should be banned in public places. "It is clear that the burqa isn't the right article of clothing for the population in Germany," says Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann, a member of the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party to Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU). It is time to determine, Hermann says, as to "how that can be achieved."
The answer, though, is that it likely cannot be. An broad ban on facial veils would be an "encroachment on religious freedom" that "cannot be justified under constitutional law and would infringe on religious freedoms" in Germany, according to a report compiled by German parliament's research services. As long as the constitution is not amended, the report argues, such a ban is impossible.
According to Mathias Rohe, an expert from the Bavarian city of Erlangen on law and Islam, religious freedoms can only be curtailed "where safety concerns in the workplace or in street traffic make identification necessary or where open communication is obligatory." 
In practice, however, such a regulation may not even be necessary in Germany. There are, after all, already plenty of rules governing such situations. 
In German passport photos, for example, veils may at most cover the forehead and ears. International rules likewise stipulate that mouth, nose and eyes must be recognizable. During airport identification checks, the German Federal Police can require a woman to remove her veil, a procedure which takes place in an enclosed room with a female officer.
Security inspections at courthouses work similarly. In the courtroom, it is also expected that defendants or witnesses remove their veils, but there are no clear guidelines in place. As such, Bavarian Justice Minister Winfried Bausback, likewise of the CSU, is demanding "legal security and legal clarity" and wants to force the federal government to establish clear legal regulations so that "people involved in legal proceedings cannot cover their faces partially or completely." In practice, though, judges have found a way to handle it -- by making it clear to women that being veiled could work to their disadvantage. 
Here, too, there are plenty of examples. When a Muslim woman in Frankfurt complained against the revocation of her unemployment payments, the judge asked her to at least show her face. Her refusal led to her claim being dismissed. In another case, a Munich district court judge attested that a woman who refused to remove her veil lacked credibility. And in the spring of 2011, a woman had to spend several weeks in jail because of her facial veil. A warrant for her arrest had been suspended on the condition that she appear in court. When she arrived completely covered, the judge did not consider her to be present. Only after her lawyer obtained a fatwa -- legal counsel from a Muslim cleric -- allowing for the "removal of the niqab for reasons of organs of justice" did the woman consent to show her face.

'Obstacle to Teaching'

Even schoolchildren and university students can now be banned from wearing facial veils. In 2014, a young Muslim woman who had applied at a vocational school in Bavaria in a headscarf saw her acceptance revoked when she showed up to class in a niqab. A court upheld the revocation, arguing that the facial veil was an "objective obstacle to teaching." It claimed that the student could not be identified, that it would hinder communication through mimicry and gestures that enables "social integration within the class," that her voice was too difficult to understand and that she was in danger of injury during scientific experiments. 
Then there was the case of a teaching student from the central German city of Giessen, who, in the face of pressure from the university, agreed to appear unveiled to lectures and seminars, but then never showed up. The case of a young Muslim woman, who had studied for years wearing a full veil at the University of Bochum, did not, however, attract public attention. The university had accepted her on the condition that she raise her veil prior to exams so that a female university employee could confirm her identity.
"The student was actually very active, pretty extroverted," says one of her professors, Stefan Reichmuth. As such, he says, there was no problem understanding her or recognizing her under the veil: "She was unmistakable." Still, after the student obtained her bachelor's degree in Islamic studies, the university established new rules. When the niqab-wearing student wanted to begin her master's studies in 2014, she was given the choice: wear her veil or continue her studies -- and she chose the veil.
In the teaching profession, veils sometimes cause conflicts, and most German states have at least enacted limitations. Full veiling can be seen as an "indication of attitudes in opposition to the values of the Western world" and could "endanger neutrality," according to a bulletin from the Hesse Interior Ministry.
Other employees of the state have likewise been prevented from wearing full veils to work. An employee of Moroccan origin at the Frankfurt municipal office, for example, had wanted to wear a full veil when she returned from her maternity leave in 2011. The city, however, objected. "We want to see the faces of our employees," says then-head of personnel, Markus Frank, a member of the CDU. The woman ultimately left her job "voluntarily."
Mothers can also be required to remove their veils in schools or kindergartens. An elementary school in the western German city of Essen, for example, has rules in place to prevent mothers from entering school grounds in a niqab. In other places, fully veiled mothers must identify themselves to female employees when picking up their child from daycare.

France's Precedent

In France, the ban on full veils emerged from a traffic incident. A police officer stopped a woman who was driving with her niqab and gave her a ticket for 22 euros, which the woman challenged as discrimination. The incident triggered a broader debate which ultimately led to a ban on any kind of facial covering in public spaces, including in schools, government buildings, means of transportation, hospitals and museums. 
Those who hoped this would lead to a decrease in the number of women in veils, however, were to be disappointed. The number of women wearing a burqa or niqab has remained almost constant over the past five years -- at about 2,000, experts say. Many of them are converts, between 20 and 30 years of age. About 400 fines are given out every year, a number that has likewise remained constant.
In Germany, a ban on burqas would have little effect, if only because no women here wear them. "In Germany I have thus far only seen one single burqa," says Rohe, the expert on law and Islam, "and that is the one I own." There are also only a few hundred Muslim women in the country who veil themselves with the niqab, according to estimates -- though cities like Munich, with high-end shopping areas, also attract tourists from the Arab world.


Either way, the debate is less about numbers than it is about symbolism. The same, of course, is true in France as well, where several beaches have banned the burqini -- the full-body swimwear preferred by some Muslim women. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls has said that it is "not a new bathing suit collection, not a fashion trend." Instead, he said: "It stands for a political project, for the creation of a counter-society that is based on the subjugation of women."
The Sparkasse branch in Neuss, by contrast, has opted for a practical solution. The couple in question was invited in for a meeting and told that the issue was not religious freedoms but security for all customers -- which is why the bank's sign did not explicitly indicate that veils were prohibited. "During Carnival we have revelers who want to enter the Sparkasse with clown masks and so forth, and that isn't acceptable either, of course," says Sparkasse spokesperson Stephan Meiser. 
It was agreed that the woman would go to the central branch and notify them about her visits ahead of time. A female employee is then made available to accompany the woman into a side-room where her veil is lifted. The two then return to the main area. Since then, there haven't been any problems. "Thank God," says Meiser, "the situation has been resolved."



There's one thing that the current debate in Germany over banning the burqa has nothing to do with: security. A weapon or explosives, after all, can be hidden under any jacket or in any backpack -- and whether a person's face is veiled has nothing to do with it. Nor does the debate really have anything to do with integration, because banning the burqa will not lead to anyone's integration. The debate isn't even addressing a real issue: Only a tiny fraction of Muslim women in Germany are entirely veiled. 


The debate has more to do with party politics and electioneering. In a complicated integration debate, the burqa is like manna from heaven for those who seek to over-simplify: Everyone can have their say and a ban simulates decisiveness, making it look like one of the problems Germany faces when integrating Muslims has been solved. 
In the final analysis, the debate is really about fear -- the fear German conservatives have of the right-wing populist party Alternative for Germany. And our fear of Islam. The burqa -- or more precisely, full body veils worn by Muslim women -- has become the symbol of everything that we reject in Islam. And when an enlightened society becomes engulfed in a debate over a symbolic problem, then this fear must be pretty big indeed.
Clothing, especially for females, has always been a part of the battlefield in the cultural clash between tradition and modernity. We long fought over how much skin it was acceptable to show, but today the debate is over the amount of veiling we are willing to accept. In Europe, veiling has become symbolic of Islam's suppression of women -- a point of view shared by some, but not all, Muslim women. But for us Westerners, veiling also represents foreignness and undesirability. Nothing symbolizes the ominous and opaque side of Islam better than a scarf that obscures a person's identity. Whether we tolerate the burqa or not is a question that serves to highlight the limits of our tolerance.

Domineering and Arrogant

Among those demanding a burqa ban, two motives are intertwined -- one egotistical and the other altruistic. The ban is to protect our free society from fundamentalist Islam -- that's the egotistical drive. But it is also meant to liberate Muslim women -- that's the altruistic part. Behind the second motive is the assumption that no woman voluntarily wears the veil, but that is wrong. It may be true that women in the Islamic world do not have equal rights. In Iran, there are millions of women who hate the headscarf and would happily shed it immediately. At the same time, in Egypt, Turkey or the Maghreb states of North Africa, where there are no laws requiring it, more women are wearing the headscarf today than did so 20 years ago. It's a symbol for them too -- a way of differentiating themselves from a West they view as domineering and arrogant. 
A significant number of the women in full-body veils in Germany are Arab tourists on shopping trips. Many more are converts, women who, in their search for meaning, stability and community have found their way to radical Islam in much the same way people become Scientologists or Jehovah's Witnesses. To them, wearing the full-body covering is a form of targeted provocation, a kind of protest. We should react to them just as we do to mohawks and large tattoos, other forms of visible provocation.


You can't force societal progress by banning religious symbols and traditions. Every forced liberation evokes a counter-reaction: That was the case when Atatürk banned Turkish women from wearing the veil and when Reza Shah did the same in Iran. It also happened when Peter the Great ordered the Boyars to shave off their beards. Liberation must come from within -- Muslim women must win the battle on their own, and they've been fighting for some time. 
Pick your battles, they say -- a sentiment that also applies to strong countries like Germany that are based on the rule of law. A few fully covered women do not threaten our freedoms. Nor will they set back women's emancipation in Europe. Of course we expect Muslims in Germany to adhere to our constitution. But that same constitution also sets high hurdles when it comes to curbing religious freedoms or other civil liberties. And clothing rules are a massive incursion on personal rights.
Banning the burqa is irrelevant to the fight Islamist fundamentalism and to the battle for the liberation of Muslim women. It would merely save us from having to look at them. What we should instead be doing is extending a helping hand to those who are suppressed in the form of language courses, neighborhood meetings or invitations for a coffee. We should be confident that our way of life is attractive enough that it encourages imitative forms of emancipation.

Managers at Volkswagen know with whom they have to maintain friendships. After the then EU Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship Antonio Tajani paid a visit to the company in the spring of 2010, he received a package. "We hope to make you happy with this VfL Wolfsburg jersey signed by the players," the head of VW's Brussels office wrote deferentially.


The gift was a complete success. Tajani thanked the VW official effusively, writing that VW was "undoubtedly one of the pillars of German industry." In a letter written on March 24, 2010 to the man at Volkswagen, he wrote that he had been very pleased by the "souvenir from the 2008/2009 German (football) champion."
Tajani should have had every reason to be asking the people at VW serious questions instead of sending them thank you letters. For instance, he should have asked why their diesel vehicles were emitting much higher levels of toxic exhaust gases on the road than in laboratory tests performed by approval agencies.
Meeting minutes, correspondence and conversation records that SPIEGEL ONLINE and the Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet have obtained now show that the European Commission and member states knew, since 2010 at the latest, that the extremely harmful emissions from diesel cars were strikingly higher than legal levels.
But apparently none of the officials wanted the automakers to tell them why this was the case. According to EU officials, pressure from countries with a strong auto industry, most notably Germany, significantly reduced interest in an investigation. Instead of doing something about the environmental policy violation, the Commission and the member states passed the buck to each other. This undignified back-and-forth even continued after the VW scandal about manipulated diesel cars in the United States was exposed in September 2015.

EU Notified Of Problem Early On

The EU bureaucracy was one of the first to be informed, through its research organizations, about the high nitric oxide emissions of the VW vehicle fleet. In 2007, experts with European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) tested the emissions from operating diesel cars. Additional tests using the so-called PEMS method were performed in 2011 and 2013. The results were the same each time: Nitric oxide (NOX) emissions were several times higher than the levels measured in type approval tests in the laboratory.
Volkswagen was already making an unfavorable impression at the time. The biggest nitric oxide emitter in the 2011 and 2013 tests was a VW Multivan with a diesel engine. This emerges from the list of names of the car models involved, which were not published at the time but has been obtained by SPIEGEL ONLINE. The other eight diesel cars, however, that were randomly selected by the JRC engineers for the PEMS test had the same problem. Be it the Fiat Scudo, Bravo or Punto, the VW Golf or Passat, the Renault Clio or the BMW 120d, not a single model even remotely complied with nitric oxide limits in normal operation.
The resourceful engineers who came up with the PEMS test had accomplished a pioneering feat, but as the minutes from a workshop in November 2010 demonstrate, their successful efforts initially had no consequences. The workshop was attended by representatives of the member states and automakers at the invitation of Tajani's Directorate-General Enterprise and Industry. As the minutes of the meeting show, diesel cars that had been approved in accordance with the Euro 4 and 5 emissions standards were emitting four to five times the allowable limit of nitric oxide during road operation.
In the workshop, experts from the JRC, as well as from the Netherlands and Great Britain, arrived at a withering assessment. Despite the increasingly stringent Euro standards, they said, the nitric oxide emissions of diesel cars "are (at best) more or less flat," and they have been so for the last 25 years. In fact, they noted, the percentage of an especially dangerous gas, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), had even increased, because cars with catalyzed soot filters, which had become very common, emitted more of the substance.

A gray haze over Italy in March 2005 -- Northern Italy in particular is often faced with serious air pollution.



Tens of Thousands of Deaths Each Year

By that point, the authorities should have been addressing the problem with great urgency: The air quality in many large EU cities was miserable. In 2008, for example, 296 of 821 zones in a total of 21 EU countries reported fine particulate matter levels in the air in excess of allowable thresholds. The NO2 limits were exceeded in 188 zones. Nitric oxides, especially NO2, are considered highly hazardous to health, with the potential to cause breathing problems, inflammation of the lung tissue and asthma. According to an April 2016 statistic by the European Environmental Agency, about 72,000 people in the EU die prematurely as a result of high nitric oxide levels every year.
The Commission identified the main source of the gases long ago. According to the minutes of a meeting of European Commission experts in April 2010, "traffic and especially diesel vehicles are predominant sources of NOx (nitric oxide) and NO2 in urban areas." 

Still, nothing happened. Two years later, in October 2012, the Commission threatened at least 22 member states with infringement proceedings for violations of air quality directives, "mainly due to the exceedance of NO2 concentration levels in ambient air," reads an internal Commission briefing. To date, the European Commission has launched proceedings against nine countries, including Germany. More countries could follow, say officials.

'A Very Peculiar Combustion Strategy'

The auto industry tried to throw sand into the eyes of EU officials. They blamed the large discrepancies between laboratory and road tests on the testing procedures. And they argued that people drive differently on the road, and that wind and rolling friction also contributed to the discrepancies.
Experts with no ties to the auto industry stopped believing those arguments long ago. "Exhaust values may vary by 10 percent or so," says Axel Friedrich, who worked for the German Federal Environment Agency for many years and is now an adviser to the environmental organization Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH). "But four to five times as high? That could only be caused by manipulation."
Friedrich and DUH, together with other environmental organizations, repeatedly informed the European Commission and the German government that the cars were either detecting that they were undergoing a test cycle or were so cleverly programmed that they would only clean exhaust gases to the maximum extent when they were undergoing very specific driving situations during the tests -- but not in normal road traffic.
There are indications in EU documents that there were suspicions about the automakers at an early juncture. According to the minutes of the European Commission workshop in November 2010, for instance, a car tested by the JRC emitted extremely high levels of nitric oxide in a low temperature range. "This observation hints towards a very peculiar combustion strategy," say the experts, speculating that the unusual results could be caused by a device cheating the approval procedures.
This citation in the EU documents is especially damning: After the VW scandal came to light, investigative commissions appointed in various EU countries encountered a "defeat device" in cars from almost every manufacturer that drastically reduced emission control at lower or higher temperatures. The experts used the euphemistic term "temperature window." After his VW Investigative Commission presented its report, German Transportation Minister Alexander Dobrindt said that this practice by automakers had been unknown until then.

'Everyone Is Aware of the Problem'

But the public assertions of ignorance by lawmakers and government officials contradict the level of knowledge within government agencies. On July 25, 2012, Industry Commissioner Tajani wrote a letter to the relevant ministers of the member states. In Germany, this was then Economics Minister and chairman of the pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP) Philipp Rösler. Tajani proposed a "market monitoring system" to ensure that the member states took "corrective action" when cars did not satisfy the requirements for EU model approval or posed a threat to the environment, or "if there are falsifications or manipulations in such products." Everyone involved, Tajani added, was "aware of the problem."
A letter Tajani received in February 2013 from then Environment Commissioner Janez Potocnik was even more specific. He wrote that there are "widespread concerns" that engine tuning in cars "has been tailored tightly to compliance with the test cycle in disregard of the dramatic increase in emissions outside the narrow scope." He alluded to a legal condition that had been in place since 2007, under which cars were required to satisfy emissions standards in both the laboratory and in normal operation -- adding that this was apparently not being followed.
Suspicions of illegal activity went on the record again in November 2014, when the EU Directorate-General for the Environment again warned the Industry Commission about "certain current practices documented extensively by the JRC and others." It described the practices as "emissions-reducing technologies, which are switched off at low temperatures or when the vehicle needs additional power." According to the letter, it was clear that these practices were subverting exhaust-gas testing during model approval, and that this was a violation of existing laws.

Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil

But Industry Commissioner Tajani, now seen as a possible successor to European Parliament President Martin Schulz, continues to insist that he did not suspect any illegal activity in the auto industry. "I was never informed about the defeat devices or the fraudulent activities that came to light as a result of the VW scandal," Tajani told SPIEGEL ONLINE. Besides, he added, the US authorities did not discover the defeat devices in VW cars on their own, but rather, it was VW that confessed to its use of the cheating software.
This is true, but VW only acted after US authorities had threatened not to approve the company's 2016 models. This, in turn, was a result of the massive discrepancies between laboratory results and actual emissions. The EU was well informed about these discrepancies, and had been so for years. So why didn't the Europeans react as strongly as the Americans?
For one thing, there is the matter of European regionalism. The member states, and not the Commission, are responsible for car type approval, and they were apparently only too willing to look the other way when it came to emissions. Once a national registration authority has rubber-stamped a car, the manufacturer is off the hook. This is handled differently in the United States, where the automaker can be held liable if its products are retroactively shown not to be in compliance with the law.
Besides, the European Commission is not a law enforcement agency, Tajani notes. It can only take action, he explains, "if it has evidence that (a) member state has breached EU law" -- and that, Tajani implies, was not the case. This is surprising, though, because the directive on the 2007 Euro 5 and Euro 6 emissions standard explicitly states that the emissions limits apply to actual road operation. The European Commission has known since 2008 that these limits were greatly exceeded.

'Playing with Fire'

Apparently some at the Commission disagreed with Tajani. It was clear "that the massive discrepancy between test bench readings and actual emissions was hardly legally tenable," says a Commission official who was involved in the case at the time. He adds that he told the automakers "very clearly: 'You are playing with fire,'" long before the VW scandal.


But the car manufacturers remained undaunted. And why not? The 2007 EU directive required the member states to define sanctions for violations by Jan. 2, 2009. But the German government, like the other member states, still has not defined any sanctions to this date.
Instead, Transportation Minister Dobrindt cleverly played the ball back into Brussels' court. When his ministry conducted its investigation after the VW manipulations were exposed, the experts discovered the various emissions tricks within a few months. But Dobrindt told an astonished public that the manipulations had all been conducted to protect the engines. The EU, he noted, had unfortunately neglected to define, in its directives, the extent to which the exception for protecting engines was to be applied.
The winners in this fight over responsibility are the automakers, like Opel and Mercedes, who have exploited it to shirk their own responsibility. The Volkswagen Group, which will be paying billions of euros in fines in the United States, can feel secure against criminal prosecution in Europe.



In our increasingly interconnected world, people are no longer satisfied experiencing new cultures, traditions or languages the old-fashioned way, with a well-thumbed guidebook in hand. Instead we travel to Haiti to build houses, survey pink dolphins in the Amazon or work on an organic farm to learn about village culture in Romania. The traditional tourist is being replaced by a more engaged traveler: the voluntourist. 


The sector has become a big global business. In 2008, the Association for Tourism and Leisure Education Research estimated the global value of the industry at around $2 billion, with a total of around 1.6 million voluntourists a year. 
A large proportion of these voluntourists are recent or imminent graduates, eager to offer their services while simultaneously rounding out their CVs for future employers. The root of this instinct is admirable -- an altruistic urge to bridge a cultural gap beyond the summarily transactional one we are used to as tourists -- but critics warn that it merely represents the latest wave of neocolonialism, with voluntourists exoticizing other cultures in countries far from their homes.

Vacations for the Privileged

Sam Gregory, program director at the human rights organization Witness.org, emphasizes the importance of adopting a conscious approach that aligns with the host community's interests -- and an awareness of a voluntourist's privilege that "only those with the money, the access to a visa and the time to (volunteer)" have access to. 
There's a danger, he warns, that you "get close enough to feel like you've been exposed to another reality, but you're still able to step away."
Beyond these ideological dangers that come with voluntourism, there are also real dangers -- economic, physical and cultural -- that have taken root as an unintended result of these interventions. The first is a direct corollary of supply and demand: As more tourists seek authentic experiences through local organizations on the ground in far-flung countries, a sub-economy is springing up to cater to this niche.
This applies particularly to those institutions with links to orphanages, one of the key industries that targets prospective voluntourists. Rules governing the official status of NGOs are frequently opaque, and an organization often needs only a website and minimal social media presence to convince would-be volunteers of its legitimacy.

Nepal's 'Paper Orphans'

In 2014, UNICEF issued a warning about the dangers of orphanage voluntourism, flagging the often scant background checks on volunteers working with children and, more problematic, the deliberate separation of children from their families in order to attract fee-paying volunteers and donors. 
The problem is particularly widespread in Nepal. The Social Welfare Council in Kathmandu, which is responsible for NGO activities in the country, believes 30,000 foreigners volunteer in the country each year. The majority travel to Nepal on tourist visas, technically making the work they do illegal, but the government usually turns a blind eye. 
One of the most prominent cases of abuse took place at Mukti Nepal, a fraudulent orphanage established in Kathmandu by Goma Luitel. Children in the home had been wrongly separated from their parents and severely beaten and neglected. Luitel threatened them with bodily harm if they told volunteers they weren't really orphans. 
The case provided a textbook example of the darker side of voluntourism, one organizations like the NGO Next Generation Nepal (NGN) are working with UNICEF to try to prevent.
There have been numerous other instances in which children have been denied access to their families and basic human rights. But even in cases where they had been superficially well cared for in terms of food and shelter, children had still been trafficked and exploited for profit. 
Many are called "paper orphans" due to the illegal paperwork forged to declare the children parentless. In a 2008 report, UNICEF and children's aid organization Terre des Hommes estimated that 85 percent of the around 16,000 youth residing in orphanages in Nepal have at least one living parent.

Voluntourism After the Earthquake

There are also other ways in which voluntourism can go wrong. The aftermath of the April 2015 earthquake in Nepal, in which 8,000 people lost their lives, also sparked an upswing in voluntourists. 


In a report on volunteer efforts in the country after the quake, Martin Punacks, country director for NGN, outlined the downsides of foreign visitors trying to help in sometimes dangerous situations. Without the language, the necessary skills and appropriate equipment, they at times proved to be a greater burden for locals than help: 

Tips for Budding Voluntourists: 

Despite all these pitfalls, there are still myriad ways in which you can contribute your time and skills to people in need while traveling. Next Generation Nepal offers the following tips for making responsible decisions:


Avoid orphanages: Often they are home to children who have been trafficked for profit. These visits are also accompanied by the risk of attachment trauma from the inevitable separation the children feel when your time draws to a close.


Before volunteering, adopt a "learning mindset" and consider the suitability of your skills.This means readjusting your whole approach toward volunteering and recognizing that you first need to learn from those you wish to help.



Commit yourself to sustainability: Will the project continue to be useful after your time in the country ends? Focus on establishing relationships, a particularly important skill in areas with lots of bureaucracy and paperwork where it can take months or years before decisions are made.



Go beyond superficial engagement: This means acquiring prior knowledge of the language or customs, actions that will mean you don't require considerable introduction to become fully functional. Many voluntourists often don't surpass this stage and require constant help from locals.


Research ethical volunteering options thoroughly: Look at the organization's past history and impact in order to determine if it is legitimate.



Be an ethical Tourist: Ensure that you're not unconsciously undermining local capacity to become autonomous. Why fly in external helpers from abroad when it would serve communities far better in the long run to train locals (often in need of employment) to perform such tasks?

By heeding these points and seeing the service beyond the limited context of a short stay in the host country, it's possible we can help to break down the exoticized divisions between ourselves and others and ensure that the road less traveled of voluntourism is a two-way street.

The swarm of jack mackerel looks like a silver wall in front of the divers. Bright sunlight breaks through the water surface and makes the fishes' scales shimmer like an artfully forged mirror. As if following an invisible sign, the animals abruptly turn and fly up before quickly returning, as one undulating mass. 


Sylvia Earle, 80, glides slowly past the bodies, an underwater camera in her hand. The photo yield has been plentiful today, on the reef at Cabo Pulmo, a small coastal town on the southern end of Mexico's Baja California peninsula. The tiny village on the Sea of Cortez had once been a normal fishing village. The reef provided a decent income for a handful of families, but then the wealth of fish spread by word of mouth. 
First came the recreational fishermen, then the trawlers with their longlines and nets. By 1980, the reef had been fished bare. After pressure from locals, Cabo Pulmo was declared a national park. Since then, fishing has been banned here. In the last three decades, the biomass of fish has more than quadrupled. And the people are earning good money from ecotourism.
That's why Earle has selected Cabo Pulmo as a "Hope Spot." She has identified about 200 of these kinds of locations through her foundation, Mission Blue. Together with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), she is working on a global action plan for marine reserves. In an interview, she explains why the ocean is so important for life on earth. 


SPIEGEL: What is it that's so special about Cabo Pulmo?

Earle: Cabo Pulmo is a small place, but it is making a big difference in terms of inspiring hope. This village shows that if you make an investment, care for a place, it can recover. The fish had been depleted, the coral reefs were in trouble, but by taking the pressure off, by creating a safe place in the ocean for the wildlife that is here, recovery has taken place. The people took their ocean back, replaced the fishing with ecotourism, and the community is thriving. What I love about this place is the idea that you can use the ocean without using it up. People here show us that the best way to ensure continued prosperity is through sustainable use. The living ocean is their bank, their treasure, their hope.

SPIEGEL: What is the current situation in the Earth's oceans? What kind of crisis are we facing?

Earle: Since I began exploring the ocean in the 1950s, 90 percent of the big fish have been stripped away. Tuna, sharks, swordfish, cod, halibut, you name it, the numbers have just collapsed. Also, about half of the coral reefs are gone, globally, from where they were just a few decades ago. We have found ways to capture, kill and market ocean wildlife on an unprecedented scale. It's an absolute catastrophe. The ocean seemed like a sea of Eden. But now we are facing paradise lost.

SPIEGEL: Aren't you exaggerating? After all, the ocean seems to be endless.

Earle: We humans have this idea that the ocean is so big, so vast, so resilient that it doesn't matter what we do to it. That may have been true 1,000 years ago. But in the last 100, especially the last 50 years, we have destroyed the assets that make our lives possible. I am haunted by tomorrow's children asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks, bluefin tuna, squids and coral reefs -- while there was still time. We are depleting this immense diversity and abundance of life, and it matters tremendously for the future of the planet.

SPIEGEL: Why is that?

Earle: Life in the ocean makes Earth hospitable. We are sailing along in the universe and we have a blue engine that is making everything alright. The ocean governs the climate and the weather, it is taking care of the temperature and it is shaping the chemistry of our planet. The oxygen cycle, the nitrogen cycle, the carbon cycle, the water cycle -- all of these are linked to the existence of life in the sea. The Earth is a tiny blue speck in a universe of unfriendly options. And the ocean is our life support system. No blue, no green. It's really a miracle that we have got a place that works in our favor. And if you think the ocean isn't important, imagine Earth without it.

SPIEGEL: Mars comes to mind.

Earle: Indeed. There was a movie recently, "The Martian," that says it all. You can survive, but what kind of life is that? We are blessed with a place that is open to the universe and, despite this, supports this very thin envelope of air we call atmosphere, which holds just the right amount of oxygen for us to breathe. Our job is to keep what is working intact and not destroy what we have got. In the past few decades, Earth's natural systems have endured more pressure than in all preceding human history. What we put into the atmosphere in terms of burning fuel is unprecedented. We are not only warming the ocean and the planet as a whole, but we are also acidifying the ocean and changing its chemistry. The ocean is dying, and we have no place to escape to if this experiment doesn't go in our favor.

SPIEGEL: You spend 300 days a year traveling as kind of an ambassador for the ocean. What drives you?

Earle: If I seem like a radical it's because I have seen things that others have not. I am driven by what I know; that the world I love is in trouble. I've spent thousands of hours under water. And even in the deepest dive I have ever made, 2.5 miles (about 4 kilometers) down, I saw trash and other tangible evidence of our presence. When I was 12, we moved from New Jersey to Florida. The Gulf of Mexico was literally my backyard. Every day, I could see the ocean. At low tide I went out and played in seagrass meadows that used to come right up to the shore, filled with tiny seahorses, pipefish and soft corals. There was so much life! But then I witnessed the change, the loss of the shoreline, the loss of the mangrove trees, the loss of the seagrass meadows. Shallow bay areas were turned into parking lots. People call that reclamation, but it is the transformation of a healthy living system into something that is barren and dead.

SPIEGEL: What do you suggest doing to help the ocean?

Earle: When you are a child you learn your alphabet, your numbers, but increasingly, we must learn from the earliest stages that the highest priority has to be to maintain the world as a safe place for humankind. Fortunately, we know more about the problems that we have than in all preceding history. We know now the consequences of the things that we put into the air, into the water -- of the way we treat life on Earth. We understand that we must make peace with nature -- that our lives depend on it. With knowing comes caring. The next 10 years could be the most important in the next 10,000. It is not too late to turn things around. We still have 10 percent of the sharks. We still have half of the coral reefs. However, if we wait another 50 years, opportunities might well be gone.

SPIEGEL: Your foundation supports the designation and protection of so called "Hope Spots" around the world. What are you aiming for?

Earle: There are now more than 4,000 places in the sea around the world that have some kind of protection. The bad news: You have to look hard to find them. What you find instead is destructive fishing, mining, gas and oil exploration. Only two percent of the ocean is fully protected right now. We believe that this area has to increase at least tenfold by 2020. That's why we look globally for places that are in great shape, pristine areas that, if protected, can serve as a source of renewal. We have about 200 places already nominated as Hope Spots. Hope Spots encourage people to take the initiative, to take action on a community level.

SPIEGEL: Most people, however, feel powerless. What can each one of us do individually?



Earle: Everybody can make choices that will make peace with the natural world. You can choose not to eat tuna, not to eat swordfish, not even to eat the little herring. Eating wildlife is probably not the smartest thing that we can do in terms of maintaining the integrity of natural systems. Fish from all over the world, from deep in the sea, wind up in countries from Germany to Japan. That is just crazy. We are taking way more out of the ocean than the ocean can replenish. You should ask where your food is coming from. You should know what is taken out of the ecosystem in order to give you a moment's sustenance. Give the ocean a break. Give yourself a break. If you make the choice to just go with the flow, that is a choice to make a difference in a negative way.

SPIEGEL: What gives you hope?

Earle: Places like Cabo Pulmo do. Imagine taking the miracle that happened here and spreading hope around the world so people change the way they think about respecting nature, treating all creatures, including one another, with dignity and understanding. You can do that too, in your own life, in your community, in your country and internationally. With care and protection, with safe havens in the ocean, there is still a good chance that we can turn things around. We don't have to be that greedy generation that just continued to take down the underpinnings of what makes the planet work in our favor. Use your power to do whatever it takes to secure for humankind an enduring place on this little blue speck in the universe -- our only hope.

About Sylvia Earle
Kip Evans
Sylvia Earle, born in 1935, took part in one of the very first marine research expeditions in the Indian Ocean in 1964. In 1979, she set foot on the ocean floor near Hawaii, encased in a steel diving suit, the legendary Jim Suit. Soon after, she descended to a depth of 1,000 meters on board the Deep Rover, one of the world's first deep-sea submarines. Earle later became a scientist at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Today, she travels around the world 300 days a year as an ambassador for the ocean.





The faraway world exists in constant twilight. Although its nearby blood-red dwarf star only provides one tiny fraction of our sun's light, its warmth might still be enough to create a life-sustaining climate.


But is there really life on this newly detected planet? Nobody knows -- at least not yet. Only one thing is certain: Because of the darkness, animals and plants would look different from the ones we know from Earth. Trees and shrubs would have pitch-black leaves, as if they'd been burned. The alien flora would need to be darkly colored to use the dim starlight for its photosynthesis. 
And what about higher forms of life, like animals or intelligent beings? It's very possible that exotic organisms exist on the planet. Given that it is several million years older than the Earth, it would have had enough time for life to develop.
On the other hand, it would also have to repeatedly withstand hellish conditions. Its sun is a so-called flare star, a cosmic fire-breather that tends to produce apocalyptic eruptions of plasma. All of the planet's oceans, rivers and lakes may well have long since evaporated. 
The newly discovered planet doesn't yet have a name, but the red dwarf star around which it circles is famous: Proxima Centauri, our nearest fixed star, only 4.24 lightyears away -- our sun's closest neighbor.
That's what makes this finding so scientifically exciting. At this point, the discovery of planets that are illuminated by distant stars isn't much of a novelty anymore. Over 3,000 "extrasolar planets" have been discovered in the last few years. But most of them are many hundreds of lightyears away, and are nearly impossible to further investigate. Proxima's satellite is different: Never before have planet-hunters come upon another possible Earth that is so nearby, offering researchers the opportunity to actually search for traces of life.
The European Southern Observatory (ESO) plans on making the discovery, which has thus far been kept secret, public by the end of August. "It was hard work finding the tiny celestial body," an astrophysicist who was involved in the search told SPIEGEL. "We were at the limits of what is technologically possible when it comes to measurements."
The successful search project is called "Pale Red Dot." The name is a reference to the legendary "Pale Blue Dot" photo that the Voyager 1 space probe took in 1990 when it was in the process of leaving the solar system forever. Its photo shows the Earth as a tiny blue dot. The researchers wanted to find a corollary red twin Earth -- and they seem to have succeeded.

The Next Step

The search for planets was conducted using a specialized reflector telescope that the Europeans operate on a mountain called la Silla in the Atacama Desert in Chile. At the start of this year, the space researchers began to direct the instrument at Proxima Centauri, which cannot be seen with the naked eye. For months, they repeatedly recorded its dim starlight and the highly sensitive measurement instruments ultimately discovered that the dwarf star lurches suspiciously from side to side.







DER SPIEGEL
Graphic: A telltale play of color


At this point, the data-evaluation process has been completed. For the astrophysicists there is no doubt left: The dance of the dwarf star is caused by an unseen companion tugging at Proxima Centauri. The planet's calculated mass suggests that it is rocky, like the Earth.
Even more exciting: It moves so close to the small red sun that liquid water could exist on its surface, which is thought to be a decisive factor when it comes to the possibility of life.
The researchers' next big goal is logical. They want to determine whether the planet truly is an oasis in space. In order to do that, light from the planet would need to be intercepted and used to determine the chemical composition of its distant atmosphere. 
The simultaneous presence of oxygen and methane would be enough to indicate life. Both gases react with one another to create carbon dioxide and water. In a barren atmosphere, oxygen and methane only exist in small amounts. If the levels are high, then organisms like bacteria or algae that produce the two gases must be present -- it would be a kind of chemical fingerprint proving the existence of extraterrestrial life.
This kind of breakthrough discovery would make Proxima Centauri a tempting target for an interstellar research mission. Unfortunately, however, even this closest star is still unreachably distant.


Using today's rockets, the distance between the stars is almost impossible to traverse: A conventional space probe would need about 80,000 years to get there -- about as long as humans have existed on Earth thus far.
Things would go faster with the help of futuristic fusion propulsion, which German-American physicist Friedwardt Winterberg designed as early as the 1970s for the legendary Project Daedalus. His blueprint, which has been further developed since, sounds adventurous: The explosions of tiny hydrogen bombs, that release huge amounts of energy, could accelerate a space ship to over 10 percent of light speed.
But even a flight to the new planet at that rapid speed would take half a century -- for the astronauts who dare to go, it would be a one-way journey.

These US presidential elections were fun once. Particularly on the Republican side: At one point during the primaries, there were 17 candidates running around, including obscure current and former governors, a retired brain surgeon with sleepy eyes, the inevitable Rick Santorum -- and Donald Trump, who once impersonated a successful businessman on a reality show.


Now he's impersonating a presidential candidate. That, too, used to be fun. He played a wretched character who humiliated anyone who stood in his way: immigrants, women, Muslims, the disabled, veterans and his Republican rivals, who keeled over one by one -- "Little Marco," "Low-Energy Jeb," "Lyin' Ted." 
It was fantastic reality TV, generating fantastic ratings, fantastic headlines, fantastic page views. Haha, that Trump! Look what he's said this time! All that fun made us forget that we were talking about the world's most powerful office.
But now the fun is over. Trump has long since shown his true side. And behold, this wretched character wasn't an act after all. It wasn't a mask he wore for the primaries. That wretched character was Trump. It is Trump. There is no good Dr. Jekyll behind the evil Mr. Hyde. Donald Trump is Hyde, the monster minus Jekyll, devoid of compassion, contrition, self-control.
And that's not funny anymore. It's time to stop treating Trump like he is any other candidate and to stop equating him with others -- most notably Hillary Clinton, herself a damaged, flawed, dubious nominee who can't believe her luck, given the tougher time she would likely have running against anyone else. 
But unlike Trump, she would never be a threat to the political system, or world peace. The Trump spectacle -- gawked at, fomented and gratuitously publicized by the media -- has become an international disaster, to use his favorite term. 
Consider this: The US is actually considering handing over its nuclear codes to a man who suggests violence against his political rival, who toys with the idea of armed insurrection, who gleefully stokes violence at his rallies, who calls US President Barack Obama a terrorist sympathizer -- and repeatedly says, wink, wink, that his statements were misunderstood.
But Trump's supporters hardly misunderstand: Crushed by generational, technological and demographic changes and abandoned by a broken political system, they've been boiling from suppressed, not-so-secretly yearned-for violence for a while. They were just waiting for their leader.
They aren't bothered by the fact that he lies pathologically and has no clue about world politics, domestic and economic policy or the intricacies of diplomacy. For too long, they've been living in an alternate universe where reality and delusion blur, where truth and lies are inverted. Trump has legitimized them and their worldview.

An Unstoppable Catastrophe

It doesn't bother them, either, that he believes nothing of what he says. He's a fictional TV character, an empty shell, an alleged multibillionaire who plays the man of the people. His "positions" fluctuate like the heavy air in the arenas where they cheer him on as he barks like a dictator out of a B-movie.
His "program" is a hodgepodge of other people's shopworn talking points, which he reluctantly reads off a teleprompter until he can return to his favorite topic -- Trump.
Some say Trump is a new Hitler, a new Mussolini, a despot-in-waiting whose fearmongering manipulates the people for darker ends. But he's much too lazy for those ambitions: All he wants is to win. He has never shown any interest in the ensuing, arduous business of governing, and doubtlessly never will.
He also lacks an ideology, a political agenda. Trump's only agenda is himself, a Moebius strip of endless validation. "Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it," he yelled in his doom-and-gloom convention speech -- revealing the illusive nature of his construction.
Those kinds of people, however, are no less dangerous. The Moebius strip has ripped: Trump's rise was based solely on the principle of perpetual victory. But now he's not winning anymore. The gig is up.


As most members of the media have started to figure out his game, an increasing number of Republicans have as well. Both the media and the politicians initially played along out of cynical opportunism, as long as he provided them with high ratings and rising poll numbers. Now they are abandoning ship, not because of their conscience but out of fear for their own, compromised existence.
Too late. The catastrophe can't be stopped. Even if -- especially if -- Trump loses the elections or backs out before it, he will smash his toys like a sulking toddler. He's already poisoned US society and destroyed the 162-year-old party which created him, and now he has the ultimate goal of destroying America's democratic institutions. His angry disciples won't surrender in peace either.
There's nothing fun about that anymore.



Stay levelheaded. Keep calm. That was German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière's message after a mass shooting and two terrorist attacks jolted the country last month. Do not overreact. Make no rash decisions. First wait for the investigations to be completed in Würzburg, Ansbach and Munich.


Two and a half weeks later, de Maizière is back in the same place, on the ground floor of his ministry in Berlin. Behind him is the German eagle, black on a dark blue wall. De Maizière is about to present a raft of proposals that he and his colleagues consider necessary to combat terrorism. "Measures to increase security in Germany," he calls them.
He understands people's concerns, the minister says. That's why the state must do everything in its power. Deporting criminal foreigners must be made easier, he adds. The Facebook pages of refugees who come from countries neighboring Syria must be combed in an effort to trace any Islamic State sympathies. The minister wants to loosen data privacy laws in order to make increased video surveillance possible. That, and a lot more.
De Maizière also uses the word "levelheaded" again, albeit only once. This time, he speaks a lot more about determination. "Security has many aspects," de Maizière says, one of which is "toughness."
But things could be a lot tougher.

A Raft of Measures

Before de Maizière's much-heralded public statement, a so-called "Berlin Declaration," made the rounds among conservative state interior ministers belonging to de Maizière's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). It was originally supposed to be published next Thursday. The six-page paper begins with a turgid quote from Prussian philosopher Wilhelm von Humboldt: "Without security, there is no freedom." This is followed by a list of 27 proposals. More police. More powers for Germany's Bundeswehr armed forces to be deployed domestically. More data retention. A ban on burqas. Sanctions against new arrivals who refuse to integrate, "up to the point of expulsion."
The paper's authors even dusted off an old conservative rallying cry, demanding that rules surrounding dual citizenship be tightened after they were loosenedd by the governments of former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder in 2000 and his successor Angela Merkel in 2014.
Hundreds of thousands of German Turks with passports from both countries are having their loyalties openly questioned by some Christian Democrats. "We suggest that those who want to engage in the politics of foreign governments leave Germany," the paper reads.
Integration, security, the fight against terror, Turkish policy. The lines are blurring.
A year after Merkel's proclamation that "We can do it," there seems to be few traces of last summer's optimism in the conservatives' ranks. Back then, the chancellor was still confident that a "strong Germany" could absorb hundreds of thousands of immigrants and train and integrate them into the country's workforce.
The conservative interior ministers' proposals highlight to what extent fear has become a driving political force in Germany. Citizens fear terrorism and violence, while politicians fear the will of voters.

'A Declaration of Utter Fear'

The two most prominent forces behind the "Berlin Declaration" are men from two states where elections will be held in September. One is the interior minister of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lorenz Caffier, who compiled the proposals. The other is Frank Henkel, Berlin's senator of the interior, who enthusiastically supported them.
The two are reported to have spent weeks preparing their advance. Caffier and Henkel are the Christian Democrats' top candidates in those two northeastern states, and the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is close on their heels. The AfD is campaigning with slogans like, "Protect citizens better" and "Stop the asylum chaos now!" In both states, the Christian Democrats risk getting pushed out of the government.
In their panic, the two conservative interior ministers have been pandering to peoples' fears, however absurd they may be. For instance, as calls for a burqa ban grow louder, the number of Muslim women who actually wear the full-body covering, at least in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, is probably quite low.

Even experts within the security apparatus are bewildered by the smorgasbord of proposals. "The paper reads like a declaration of utter fear of the AfD," says André Schulz from the German Police Union. "Of course we'd be grateful for more personnel. But in many other aspects, it's reasonable to question whether they can really provide more security."
Even Interior Minister de Maizière feels duped. There is talk in his party of a "targeted affront" because some of his state-level counterparts are stealing the show with their haste. Contrary to initial reports, de Maizière did not sign off on the first version of the "Berlin Declaration."
De Maizière deems a veil ban unconstitutional. "You can't ban everything you don't agree with," de Maizière says. In addition, his party will not attempt to abolish dual citizenships -- that would violate the treaty the Christian Democrats have with their coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD). For the latter, a reform of Germany's citizenship laws was one of the major modernization projects of the past 20 years.
Those were the two points that the SPD had honed in on over the last week. Rolf Jäger, the interior minister of Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, spoke of a "crude pandering to rightist clientele." The floor leader for the SPD in the German parliament, Thomas Oppermann, called them a "desperate attempt to show a conservative profile," saying the paper contained "almost exclusively measures from the discard pile of domestic security. The conservative state ministers had "overshot their target," Oppermann added. The leader of the Social Democrats and Germany's vice chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, left no room for doubt that an abolishment of dual citizenship would not be possible as long as his party was in the government.

Summer of Angst

One thing is certain: The final version of the "Berlin Declaration" will contain a number of revisions by the time it's formally adopted by the conservative interior ministers on August 18. Drafts are already making the rounds in which certain passages have been completely stricken from the paper, most notably the one about abolishing double citizenship.

But postponing something is not the same as abandoning it completely. In conservative circles, some are weighing whether to keep those proposals warm for next year's election campaign. The images of supporters of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan waving flags in Cologne in recent days left many Christian Democrats fuming. Some in the party believe this could be used to score points among voters. "This issue hits a nerve," one party representative said.
Stay levelheaded? Keep calm? In this summer of angst, few are still capable of that.
The latest survey by the respected German pollster Infratest dimap for public broadcaster ARD likely provides cold comfort for Germany's top political parties, especially for Merkel's conservatives. Only one-third of Germans believe the chancellor is pursuing the right refugee policies. And three-quarters are afraid of further terrorist attacks. "We need to act now," urges CDU campaigner Caffier.







DER SPIEGEL
Graphic: Loss of Trust


Now? In recent months, German security laws have already been tightened and additional restrictions have been added to asylum laws. Even government representatives admit that the moves were "pretty tough."
Reforms that went into effect in March make it easier to deport foreigners if they are convicted of crimes. Politicians made the change in response to the sexual attacks in Cologne on New Year's Eve. And just before the summer recess, the Christian Democrat and Social Democrat-led government coalition also pushed through new anti-terror legislation enabling the country's domestic intelligence agency, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, to conduct surveillance against people as young as 14 and to share data with all EU and NATO countries. In the future, the German Federal Police and the Federal Criminal Police Office will be permitted to deploy undercover agents to respond to potential threats.
Following the mass shootings and attacks of recent weeks, Chancellor Merkel ultimately presented a "Nine-Point Plan" that offers an A to Z package of responses, ranging from deportations to increased cooperation with foreign intelligence services. None of the nine points is entirely new, but they are now to be pursued with much greater energy. They include provisions making it easier for the German armed forces to be deployed domestically -- a step that Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen is hoping to use to chalk up political points.
Meanwhile, CSU leaders are calling for electronic ankle bracelets to be placed on potential attackers. The Bavarian state interior minister, Joachim Herrmann, also said there can no longer be "any taboos" when it comes to deporting refugees to crisis regions.
It's getting difficult to keep track of all the demands being made.

Going Too Far?

This week, Interior Minister de Maizière drew criticism with a proposal that came across like a half-baked idea. Even before he presented his 16-page list, news leaked that he wanted to loosen doctor-patient secrecy laws in order to enable early detection of possible attacks.
The proposal prompted criticism not only from doctors, but also from one of his allies within his own party, German Health Minister Hermann Gröhe, who had been on a trip to the United States. De Maizière had apparently not run his ideas by the Health Ministry. Gröhe's ministry promptly reported that doctors are already permitted to contact the authorities if they have any information about a possible terror threat -- if, for example, a potential terrorist or mass shooter hints at such an attack during a therapy session. The ministry warned that any move to further tighten laws might keep a potential attacker from seeking therapy in the first place.
Frank Ulrich Montgomery, the president of the German Medical Association, intervened the same day the news got leaked. In response, the interior minister publicly stated that he had no intention of eliminating doctor-patient confidentiality rules. He said he would seek a dialogue with doctors about "reducing the threat to people to the greatest degree possible."
"There must be a response to the feelings of insecurity among the populace," says Jürgen Falter, a professor of political science at the University of Mainz. But in order "to maintain credibility, politicians need to speak with a single voice." That's not happening though, he says. Many of the latest proposals are coming from individuals within the Christian Democrats and haven't been agreed to within the party or with its coalition partner, the SPD, or even clearly thought out. That's not how you convince voters, says Falter. 

'Not How You Create More Security'



The cacophony of voices around the issue of security is also upsetting some within conservative circles. Sources within the Christian Democrats say that if the goal had been to provide a show of strength in the run-up to elections in Berlin and the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, then the party has failed. "First a packet of anti-terror laws, then a nine-point plan, now a 'Berlin Statement,' and then de Maizière on top of it all -- this is not exactly how you create more security," the source says.
Burkhard Hirsch, the former interior minister for the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, describes it as a "hapless attempt to signalize to voters that we're not inactive." The security agencies' powers have been expanded in unprecedented ways in recent years, he adds, with Germany's Constitutional Court having to step in more than a dozen different times because the government went too far. "If this kind of agitation continues, then we will jeopardize the liberal way in which we live," says Hirsch, who belongs to the libertarian-leaning Free Democratic Party.
Domestic security has always been one of the conservatives' key issues. But now it could be said: Fear eats the soul.

The artist Hieronymus Bosch probably had the most prodigious imagination of his day. He was the great surrealist of the waning Middle Ages. His paintings were both a promise and a threat, intended to convey an idea of what would happen in paradise and, even more so, in hell. He created labyrinths of atrocities and a vocabulary of the bestial. He depicted devils and monsters, but also people being tortured, naked people whose throats were being slit, almost as if they were part of a scene in the latest propaganda video from the self-proclaimed Islamic State (IS). And then there are images and motifs that seem comedic in their sheer absurdity.
Bosch, this mysterious painter whose motives were unclear, died 500 years ago, in August 1516. One thing is certain: The Dutchman from the Duchy of Brabant did not spare his audience. He painted what no one had painted before him. And he must have had his own dark humor. In one painting, he depicts a dwarflike being with an upper body that resembles an egg, while the lower body is reminiscent of a lizard. But the gaunt face is that of a human being, with glasses perched on his nose. It is often speculated that this may have been the face of Bosch himself.
He painted this curious being in the corner of a plate, next to Saint Mark the Evangelist foreseeing the End of Time. Did Bosch also perceive himself as a visionary? As someone who wanted to make mankind squirm as it learned of its future? Are his paintings a painted version of gallows humor?

A Unique Universe

This visionary is being celebrated in 2016, eulogistically, of course, with exhibitions, books and films. Almost all museums in his native Brabant are honoring him this year, including the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, which is billing him as a role model for modern artists, and the Brabant Museum of Nature in Tilburg, which is devoting an exhibition to the animals and astonishing mythical creatures in Bosch's art. His paintings can be seen at the Prado in Madrid, and he is also the main event at the Bucerius Art Forum in Hamburg. Franco-German public broadcaster ARTE will broadcast a documentary on August 21, and a longer version titled "Hieronymus Bosch, Touched by the Devil" will open in cinemas in September. The filmmakers spent years accompanying a Dutch team of experts that had set out to painstakingly study the life and works of Bosch, and it became a witness to the tension in the international community of near-obsessive Bosch specialists.
There are only 25 oil paintings, some in multiple parts, that art historians more or less agree came from Bosch himself. These works hang in European and American museums. There are also a similar number of drawings. Institutions that own one of these rare pieces possess an invaluable treasure. The Prado in Madrid long believed it had six originals, until art historians from the Netherlands attributed three of them to Bosch's employees or successors. In the film, the experts barely manage to maintain a polite tone when interacting with one another.
In fact, it is not easy to determine what Bosch painted himself. Because business was good, he had employees who tried to paint in his style as best they could. Many others simply copied him, both during his lifetime and long afterward. Panels were even treated with smoke in chimneys to make them seem older and more original.
But the few works that are clearly attributable to Bosch form a unique, exciting universe. He created science fiction that was inspired by the afterlife, and to this day, no one can explain how he came up with his ideas. Of course, people in the Middle Ages had notions of what demons could look like. They appeared (as a deterrent) as decorations in church architecture, but they lacked the imaginative, abstruse and narrative qualities of Bosch's works.
Take, for instance, the bird-like figure in the painting "The Garden of Earthly Delights" that has pitchers for feet instead of claws, eats people while sitting on a toilet chair, then excretes them out in undigested form into a blue, balloon-like bubble, which opens into a hole in the earth filled with brownish water into which the damned souls are deposited as two others vomit and defecate into it. 
His studio produced many other images as well. In one painting, an arrow penetrates two giant ears, which appear to be going somewhere. A man is impaled by the strings of a harp. Demons keep pouring wine into the mouth of a man who is already bloated. There is a female head without a body, but with shod feet. There are heads with feet, fish with feet, beings that are part animal and part human, monster-like humans, machine-like humans and tree-like humans with strange things happening in their open trunks. There are curious flying objects and flying fish. Some fantasy animals appear to be wearing diving bells instead of shells, and some buildings look like breathing, organic creatures.

Modern Parallels

There are also many details that hardly seem comic and feel horrifically contemporary. Images of people falling from burning ruins into an abyss are reminiscent of images of the attacks of Sept. 11. There are impaled bodies and severed heads hanging from sticks, with blood dripping from them, as if in anticipation of the images that IS terrorists would one day disseminate. And a figure seen beating Christ with a rope uses the same hand motion as the angry man in Istanbul who was photographed whipping arrested coup plotters with a belt.

There are bodies lying on red-hot stones and burning in open furnaces, and there are human beings drowning in cesspools, being hanged or impaled, their stomachs seeming to explode. The figures that are still alive appear to have given up hope. Amid images of raging fires, it seems as if the entire world had been split open.
A few years ago, there was a debate over whether it was appropriate to show images that documented US soldiers torturing inmates at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The scenes Bosch painted centuries ago are no less gruesome. But he wasn't painting the future. He had found images depicting an archaic sadism, and he could have only guessed that, half a millennium later, people would still be behaving as they had done thousands of years before his time. His painted oak panels show how far the present has fallen back into brutish patterns.
He repeatedly inserted ordinary elements into his scenes, such as familiar landscapes, churches, windmills, everyday faces and everyday clothing. But this harmlessness, this generic reality, which he treats like the Promised Land, can topple at any time. Hell is never far away. This was how he conveyed his sense of the uncertainty of life.

Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq: Bosch could only have guessed 500 years ago that, half a milleinnium later, eople would still be behaving as they had done thousands of years before his time.



But mankind remains ignorant. Bosch also illustrated this in his allegories. People, whether rich or poor, chase pleasure and, to an even greater extent, money (symbolized by a haywain in Bosch's works), and they continue to cling to their earthly possessions even after death, to the delight of the demons under their deathbeds. In one image, nuns and monks are celebrating on a ship, making fools of themselves like everyone else, but they too are unknowingly heading for the realm of the devil. The source of inspiration for this composition was likely the popular morally satirical book, "Ship of Fools," by the Basel-based legal scholar Sebastian Brant, who also believed that man was "only three finger-widths away from death."
Bosch translated this attitude, and he did so with great virtuosity, and with brisk, confident brush strokes. He knew how to create loud and quiet dramatic art. He placed the small shadows of people in front of the light of a blazing fire, and added a touch of red paint to the eyes of an exhausted Jesus, essentially painted in close-up.
Where did he learn to do this? Painting was the craft with which he had grown up and that his family had mastered. His great-grandfather and his grandfather were painters. So were his father, his uncle, his two older brothers and his nephews.

Demanding Innovation

He was born Jheronimus van Aken in 1450, but he was called Joen. His place of birth was the commercial city of 's-Hertogenbosch, or The Bosch. As a painter, he later took the name Hieronymus Bosch, in reference to the city, and that was how he signed his paintings -- in large, unmistakable letters. The little surviving information about his works includes written mentions of the fact that he had taken on the name, even though it was not his real name.
Bosch's parents purchased a house in 1462, on the eastern side of the market square, in an area where many other craftsmen lived (painting was a trade like any other). Bosch was still a boy when the family moved into the house. A fire destroyed large portions of the city a year later. Such fires, life-threatening and yet breathtaking, later appeared in his paintings.
Around 1480, he married a well-situated merchant's daughter named Aleid van de Meervenne, a woman he may have known since childhood. They moved into a house that Aleid had inherited. It too was on the market square, but in a more upscale location. Apparently the couple had no children. He advanced in local society and became a "sworn" member of a religious brotherhood. Swans were served the three times he hosted the group's annual meeting.
His customers ranged from dignified to high-ranking. They included important church congregations, the upper class and even the high aristocracy, most notably the Hapsburgs. The son of Emperor Maximilian I ordered a "Last Judgment," and he gave his powerful father another work, a "Temptation of St. Anthony." The most famous Bosch work today, the "Garden of Earthly Delights," was apparently created for the Counts of Nassau, who were also influential people in the Habsburg realm.
Bosch must have been aware of his uniqueness. He wrote on one of his drawings: "Poor is the mind that always uses the inventions of others and invents nothing itself." The demand for innovation revealed an attitude that already reflected the thinking of the Renaissance. Perhaps he did view painting as more than simply a craft, but as a higher art.

The painter was about 65 when he died, or possibly somewhat younger. He died in an epidemic, not of the plague, but apparently of a similarly sinister disease. His funeral on August 9, 1516 was celebrated with singers.
Bosch remained an admired figure. A year after his death, the secretary of a Roman cardinal praised his paintings for being "enchanting and fantastic." Bosch's works also reached Spain and court of the Spanish king early on. In 1605, a book was published by a Spanish abbot, who described Bosch's paintings as the "most ingenious" and "artful" thing "one could imagine."
But this scholarly monk, José de Sigüenza, also had to protect the works from those who berated the painter as a heretic after his death. Without his paintings, Sigüenza said, man would be "so blind that he is not aware of the passions and vices that keep him transformed into a beast, or rather so many beasts." Sigüenza described the Bosch works he knew as a "satire in paint on the sins and ravings of mankind," saying that this painter had drew his absurdities from "the reality and actuality of the world."

We Can Only Speculate over Meaning

His allusions and his excessive symbolism were probably better understood at the time, but much of the knowledge of the day has been lost. Today we can only speculate over what Bosch meant, and how it was understood in his time. In the documentary film, an American art historian says that his profession is about predicting the past.
Bosch spent his first 40 years living in an era when there were no certainties, not in his immediate environment and not in the portion of the world that was known at the time. Wars and high taxes triggered unrest. The economy was in decline, and this only changed in his city in the late 15th century, when prosperity began to increase again. But the feeling of being at the intersection between two eras, of literally lurching between two periods and not knowing what was next must have been a formative influence on Bosch and many others around 1500. Anything could happen at any time, violent escalations were a constant threat, and the all-important church was also faltering. The desire for a renewal of the faith existed before Martin Luther. The period would later be characterized as an emergence into the modern era, which sounds lighter and more optimistic than it actually was for the people of the day.
A movement called "Devotio moderna" gained momentum early on in the Netherlands. Human beings were viewed as individuals, not as part of a devout mass of people, and this included their relationship with God. Experts suspect that Bosch wanted to show his audience that man was a traveler "on the path through life." According to Bosch, this traveler, and not a higher power, was responsible for his own decisions. That too is a surprisingly modern concept.



Larry Vance, 67, a Canadian flight accident investigator, has worked on more than 200 airplane crashes, including that of Swissair Flight 111, an MD-11 aircraft that crashed off the Canadian coast in 1998, killing all 229 people on board. Vance concluded the four-year-investigation with a report detailing how a fire had started inside a cockpit panel, probably due to some faulty wiring. Since retiring from Canada's Transport Safety Board in 2009, he started a career as an independent investigation consultant, and also teaches accident investigator courses worldwide. Now Vance has focused his attention on the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which had been en route to Beijing on March 8, 2014 when it vanished from radar screens.



SPIEGEL: The search for the missing Malaysian airliner will soon be abandoned and no trace of the wreck has been found. Although you weren't part of the investigation team, you claim to know exactly what happened to MH370. Isn't that a bit presumptuous?

Vance: In over 30 years on the job, I have learned how to read evidence from the parts that are available. The evidence here is pretty definitive.

SPIEGEL: Only a handful of pieces of MH370 has been found. How can that be enough to reconstruct what happened?

Vance: A flaperon, found last year, has been confirmed as coming from MH370. And a piece of flap that showed up in June will doubtless be confirmed as coming from MH370. Those two pieces are wreckage -- and wreckage can be studied for clues.

SPIEGEL: What do they tell you?

Vance: Flaperons and flaps are high-lift devices. Pilots deploy them when they need to fly at lower speeds during the final stage of the flight. The photos clearly show that the trailing edges of these devices are severely damaged whereas the leading edges are virtually unharmed. This is an extremely significant piece of information.

SPIEGEL: Why?

Vance: There is simply no other conclusion you can make: The flaps were extended when the aircraft hit the water. The trailing edge was dragged over water for some time -- some seconds -- to erode the trailing edges of those pieces. This evidence is easy to read. The pressure from being dragged through the water exceeded the structural strength of the attachment points of those pieces. They flew off, fell back in the water and presented themselves in the state they are in.

SPIEGEL: Assuming the flaps were extended -- what exactly would that prove?

Vance: A lot. Hydraulics and electrics must have been available. One engine at least must have been running. The airplane did not run out of fuel as is often said. And most importantly: The flaps were selected that way. Somebody in the cockpit did that.

SPIEGEL: Couldn't they have been deployed automatically?

Vance: No. Somebody pushed the lever, there is no other way to move the flaps. Somebody wanted that airplane to land on the surface of the ocean in such a way that the fuselage stayed intact, so that everything would go to the bottom, never to be found or seen again. All this talk of this being aviation's biggest mystery makes me angry. There is absolutely no mystery to what happened. It's a mystery why somebody would do this.

SPIEGEL: Could this somebody be a hijacker who took over the cockpit?

Vance: Impossible. In order to land a Boeing 777 on a choppy ocean you need to be a seasoned pilot.

SPIEGEL: Australian investigators have confirmed that Zaharie Shah, the captain of Flight MH370, had plotted a very similar course into the southern Indian Ocean on his home simulator. He did this weeks before that flight. Is this conclusive proof?

Vance: It fits the story.

SPIEGEL: Would that make MH370 a precursor incident to Germanwings Flight 9525 which was deliberately crashed into the French Alps by a suicidal co-pilot barely a year later?

Vance: I can't comment on that. I do flaps and stuff. I don't do criminal investigations or psychiatric evaluations.

SPIEGEL: The Australian investigators have been working under the assumption that the plane was pilotless, at least at the end. Have they been wrong?

Vance: They started off with the little information they initially had, for example data from the satellite that was sporadically in touch with MH370. They did the very best they could. I wouldn't know what I would have done differently. I have great respect for them.

SPIEGEL: But the satellite data tells a very different story than yours, and suggests that the plane's fuel tanks were empty.

Vance: The physical evidence is much more demonstrative than satellite data, which always leave room for interpretation. In accident investigation, you take the hard evidence and ask yourself: How does this other stuff fit in? In the end, it will fit, even if you struggle for a while with contradictory information from different sources. When the flaperon pictures became available, my colleagues and I knew within seconds what happened. I'd even say everybody in the business knows.

SPIEGEL: Were the passengers alive when the airplane touched down?

Vance: There is no way to know that. But my educated guess would be: No, the people died very early in the sequence, soon after the transponder was turned off. They were probably killed by apoxia which was induced by someone from within the cockpit.

SPIEGEL: Here's a different scenario: A fire starts. The plane turns back towards the airport. Pilots and passengers lose consciousness. The airplane flies automatically until fuel runs out.

Vance: Believe me, I went across all possible scenarios. If you have a fire on board, you have basically 20 minutes or less before the aircraft is on the ground one way or the other. MH370 flew for seven hours or longer. I have seen the evidence from Swissair Flight 111 and I can tell you that MH370 simply did not strip the water in an uncontrolled state at high speed. The Swissair's debris field was 2 million pieces. I looked at most of them. You wouldn't find a single piece that has the same damage pattern as the MH370 flaperon.

SPIEGEL: Should the search for the wreckage continue?



Vance: Do I think they should have tried it? Absolutely. I would have done exactly the same thing. But it is extremely difficult to pinpoint a location if all you have is a theory. If you have no reasonable explanation for where you are looking, what's the point of just looking?

SPIEGEL: Do you expect further wreckage to be found?

Vance: I would not be surprised if a piece of a passenger or cargo door would make it to shore one day. Or maybe parts of the tail. I would not be surprised to see a minimal number of pieces from inside the fuselage. But in my opinion, that fuselage is in one piece on the bottom of the ocean. And everything that was inside the pressure vessel is still right there.

Things have grown quiet in the largest city of the "caliphate," the man from Mosul says. He had spent some time on the outskirts of the city, at times traveling only by foot, in order to pass along details from inside the Islamic State (IS), as he had often done. "When the fighting in Fallujah was still going on, there were calls from the mosque loudspeakers at least five times a day for people to join the battle. The state would triumph, the men claimed. They said they had thousands of fighters there, tons of munitions and weapons and that Fallujah couldn't possibly fall. Ever since Fallujah did fall, there have been no more appeals."


At the end of June, the Iraqi army, together with Sunni tribal fighters and Shiite militia members, liberated the city near Baghdad from the Islamists. It was the greatest defeat yet for IS, which has been losing on all fronts for months.
In recent weeks, people have been attacked in Istanbul, Dhaka, Baghdad, Beirut, Nice, Ansbach and even in a regional train near Würzburg by perpetrators using bombs, automatic rifles and an ax. Indeed, this has made Islamic State appear to be stronger and more dangerous than ever before to people in the West, but the wave of terror has simply overlapped with events in the IS' core terrain.

Mounting Pressure

The truth is that the pressure is mounting for the "caliphate," both in Syria and Iraq. An offensive against Mosul is imminent as Kurdish-led forces approach the IS' second stronghold, Raqqa. And in Libya, government troops are advancing in the direction of IS-held Sirte with air support from the United States. These could all be contributing factors behind the dramatic surge in the number of IS attacks recently.
The image that emerges from sources, who risk their lives to provide information from these regions, is one of a force in decline, wavering between retreat and delusion. People in various IS-held areas in Syria and Iraq uniformly report that the terror group still has a hold on the people living there. But given that control and fear are really the only instruments of dominance it has at its disposal, each subsequent military defeat represents an even tougher blow.







DER SPIEGEL
Graphic: Losing on all fronts


"The fighters appear frustrated and for the first time they look afraid," reports one man located in an area near the city of Hawija, which is located south of Kirkuk, Iraq. "Some are already sending their families to Mosul. Among locals who joined IS earlier, many are now saying they regret it, that they were deceived or forced to join. If only the government in Baghdad would promise them amnesty, they could find a way to the army's positions and avoid falling into the clutches of the murderous Shiite militias."
The very people who used their power as IS members during the time of the advance in 2014 to plunder the refrigerators and microwaves from the homes of neighbors who had fled have now become refugees themselves. "In Hawija, a Daeshi" -- as IS supporters are called in Arabic -- "offered a whole set of furniture on the market for $20, but it was surely worth $700," the local man explains. Some are trying to leave the "caliphate" entirely, he says, making their way north to the Kurdish regions. No one, though, is heading south. According to the man, the Shiite troops there will kill anyone who was with the Islamic State.

Increasingly Delusional

As the motley assortment of alliances between Kurdish and Shiite militias, the Iraqi army and the US Air Force recaptures one IS-held area after another, Islamic State's omnipresent Hisba religious police are growing increasingly delusional in their efforts to maintain control. Smoking and music had long been forbidden, and woman had only been able to leave home wearing a niqab, or full face veil, and accompanied by their husband or a male relative. Now the Islamists have even prohibited people from wearing red clothing.
"Red is a celebratory color, they say, and thus forbidden," the Mosul resident says. "And in math class at schools, the plus sign is no longer allowed to be used. It's the Christian cross, they say. Now they have to write: '1 added to 1, God willing, equals 2.' Those using the old character risk punishment. T-shirts or flags that bear a cross anywhere -- the FC Barcelona emblem, for example -- are now strictly prohibited."
These measures appear to be bizarre attempts to maintain control within IS-ruled territory, even as that control dwindles due to military pressure from without. The fact is, Islamic State's power is waning and overzealous regulations won't help -- at most they can give the impression that the group remains strong.
Blanket, uninterrupted surveillance has long been a central source of IS' power, helping it to conquer and maintain control of vast territory. In the beginning, its fighters would extensively surveil every area that IS wanted to capture. Then they would deceive the people there about their identity and true intentions. Finally, they would crush any resistance with demonstrative, merciless cruelty.
Religion has always served the Islamic State as a propagandistic means to an end. IS leaders used Islam to attract jihadists from Chechnya or Tunisia as well as to justify its tyranny inside the areas it controls. But the system, largely copied from Saddam Hussein, only works if those with power are able to continue exercising it.
But the Islamists' power is eroding at the moment, and it's plain for anyone to see. As soon as IS loses control of an area, residents no longer have to remain loyal to the group. If they were truly convinced, if they actually believed in the "caliphate," then the Islamic State could continue to exist there as a kind of phantom power.
In Afghanistan, for example, the Taliban's resurgence is attributable to the fact that its ideology outlasted its period of rule. Once conditions became favorable for the Taliban again -- in this case through a corrupt government that was defended by foreign troops -- they were able to return. For the same reason, al-Qaida in Yemen has always made sure not to turn the local population against it. This may have hindered swift conquests, but it also prevented the conquered from being disappointed later on.

Fighters with the Islamic State in Deir al-Zor, Syria: The terrorist organization has few supporters remaining of their own volition.


Islamic State, on the other hand, has never waited for the approval of locals. If it had tried to win hearts and minds rather than just overrun villages, it wouldn't have grown as rapidly as it did in the early stages until fall 2014. But that brutal strategy is now coming back to roost.
There is no city or village in Syria or Iraq where a majority of the population is enthusiastic about the Islamic State, according to some who have fled as well as informants on the ground. Blood donations for injured fighters, for example, had to be collected by force.
Most normal residents are simply trying to stay out of the way and survive. They are afraid, plus they assume IS will disappear in the long run anyway. Local leaders and presumably many foreign jihadists remain loyal to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, but there are otherwise few who continue to support the Islamic State of their own volition. Winning over local populations was never part of IS' plan.
Against that backdrop, liberated areas in northern Syria have seen women in particular celebrate their newly won freedom in more radical ways than one might expect in their conservative surroundings. The image of 19-year-old Souad Hamidi, who beamed as she tore off her niqab, went around the world. "Look at what we're wearing," one woman shouts in a video. "Thank you for liberating us. Thank you that I can wear red! I will always wear red!"
Hairdressers with nothing to do for the past year or two were euphoric about the sudden flood of customers. The men wished to shave off their beards. They wanted trendy haircuts, cropped short and gelled; away with the obligatory shag of IS times. Men could be seen playing cards and backgammon on the streets again, demonstratively smoking.

A Persistent Threat

Still, Islamic State has by no means disappeared. As long as the murderous air strikes by Syrian and Russian jets continue, and Sunnis continue to live in mortal fear of Shiites, IS could still return even after a total loss of its "caliphate."
The terrorist organization had been almost entirely defeated in Iraq once already. It went underground in 2008 and had been forgotten almost entirely by the time it suddenly resurrected itself in 2012, more dangerous than ever before. For the IS propaganda apparatus, this now serves as proof of its own invincibility. "Were we defeated when we lost the cities in Iraq and were in the desert without any city or land?" Islamic State spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani recently asked in an incendiary speech. "And would we be defeated, and you victorious, if you took Mosul or Sirte or Raqqa? Certainly not!"
The Islamic State was able to regain its strength four years ago because Saddam Hussein's former intelligence officers had joined forces with the Islamists -- war professionals who rose quickly, developed a long-term strategy and shaped its tactics. IS also exploited the circumstances, including a war in Syria and politics of sectarian discrimination in Iraq that excluded Sunnis from power and public offices.
The tragedy of the Washington-led battle against IS now is the fact that it is so shortsighted in its focus on military strikes. The coalition is ignoring the underlying conditions that could make a return of the Islamic State possible later.
Only days before diplomats from dozens of countries pledged to intensify the fight against IS at a meeting in Washington in early July, US Secretary of State John Kerry flew to Moscow. His suitcase was full of concessions the US was prepared to make to Russia that would allow the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad to remain in power, at least for now.


The problem is that as long as Assad continues to rule, the rebellion against him will not end. Assad's presence will hinder any true agreement with the various opposition factions in the country -- and that's the kind of unity necessary to banish the Islamic State.
Instead, the US allows itself to be taken advantage of, time and again, by groups that are also using the fight against the Islamists for their own purposes. On July 19, American bombs killed more than 50 civilians in the northern Syrian city of Manbij, which is under IS control. The Americans had obtained the target coordinates from the Kurdish-led SDF militia, which in addition to fighting IS, is trying to drive Arabs out of the areas located between its Kurdish strongholds.
Even today, Washington's anti-terror strategists still haven't come to understand the inner-workings of the Islamic State. Indeed, many still consider it to be strong even at its weakest points. "Where al-Qaida was hierarchical and somewhat controlled, these guys are not," former CIA chief Michael Hayden recently told the Washington Post. "They have all the energy and unpredictability of a populist movement." That, however, is precisely what they do not have.



When Nils D. turned his back on the Islamic State (IS), he thought about sex. He had spent a year serving the terrorist militia, performing guard duty and working as a cook. He had discovered severed heads on the street and watched beheadings. He had listened to the screams of people being tortured and looked on as they were hung from metal poles with their hands tied behind their backs. These are the kinds of atrocities he had exposed people to as a member of a special unit that was tasked to arrest alleged spies, traitors or other opponents of IS.


But by the beginning of November 2014, he wanted out. He came up with a false pretense to travel to Turkey. He wanted to meet his mother and sister in Istanbul and then journey onward to his home in Dinslaken, Germany, a town in the country's Ruhr region.
Nils D. has never said what was going through his mind that day, but his mobile phone's browser history provides some answers. He perused a list of the most wanted criminals on the German Federal Criminal Office's website because he feared he might get arrested in Germany. He also looked up ferry connections from Turkey and long-distance buses to his home state of North Rhine-Westphalia, because he feared getting checked at the airport. He also looked on the website of a popular retailer for new plus-size clothes because he needed an inconspicuous outfit and was too corpulent for normal attire. In addition, he searched for hotels in Istanbul and for sightseeing tips in the city for the days he would be spending with his mom and sister, Annika.
Most of all, though, Nils D. thought about sex. He searched for terms like "Red Light Istanbul" online. One query result contained the heading, "Bordello in Istanbul." His phone also saved the names of dozens of relevant porn clips he had played.
Before he boarded a bus from Istanbul back home, he deleted the data stored on his mobile phone. The images of him with his buddies in battle gear, the photo of him standing behind a masked, bound man holding a pistol to his head -- all of it was supposed to disappear before his return.
Today, Nils D. is being held in a German prison as a convicted terrorist. The Higher Regional Court in Düsseldorf sentenced him to four years and six months behind bars.

High-Value Sources

D. got away with a fairly light sentence because he is one of the few former jihadists who have cooperated extensively with the German authorities. For investigators, men like D. are highly valuable because in most cases the authorities have no idea what the Islamists from Germany have done in the service of IS. Often they are unable to even verify that the accused had actually been a part of IS, which is essential in order to secure a conviction on charges of being a member of a terrorist organization. 
German security agencies are tasked with investigating terrorist networks and preventing attacks. But with the exception of wiretapped telecommunications, they often have too little evidence at their disposal, because most of the more than 200 people who have returned from the combat zone are keeping silent -- or lying. 
In order to obtain more lenient sentences, a few jihadists are now confessing in court that they traveled to Syria. But their statements seldom go beyond the evidence that has been presented against them, and they don't turn in other accomplices.
However, three men have proven to be exceptions and have been cooperating extensively with the authorities. They include Nils D. of Dinslaken, Harry S. of Bremen and Harun P. of Munich, who fought in Syria for the terrorist group Jund al-Sham.
The three are taking a considerable risk. Other Islamists consider providing testimony to be treason -- and it's possible they will seek to retaliate.
Having gone from being terrorists to key witnesses, the three appear to have undergone an astonishing transformation. If their statements are to be believed, neither Nils D., 26, Harry S., 27, nor Harun P., 28, knew exactly what they were signing up for in Syria. They were radical Muslims, but they weren't leaders or fighters -- they were more hangers-on. "It's usually those who were at the periphery of a group, whose ideologies haven't yet hardened, who work with judicial authorities later," says one expert who often works with such key witnesses.

From Cards and Cafés to the Caliphate

Prior to his field trip into the realm of the murderous IS band, Nils D. had been a good-for-nothing. He would sleep until mid-day, then surf the Internet and meet up with his buddies in a café, where they took drugs, drank booze and played cards. They didn't have any hobbies and they lacked any enthusiasm. The company that had provided him with vocational training fired him because he wasn't attending the vocational school courses that were part of the program. Afterward, the most he found were temporary jobs. "I was a pothead," Nils D. says. "I didn't feel like doing anything."
This continued for years. Then D. discovered Islam through his cousin Philip B. and became a Salafist. He was still serving a sentence for grand theft when his cousin and the other guys went to Syria to fight. Then, during the autumn of 2013, D. also traveled to the "caliphate."
During his trial in the dock of the Higher Regional Court in Düsseldorf, Nils D. said "he wanted to see things for himself." He then quickly became part of the murderous system. In Manbij, he joined a special IS unit. The force's task was to capture suspected traitors, spies or deserters. D. is believed to have taken part in up to 15 missions.
He also knew what happened to the men he had helped to capture. The former pothead from Dinslaken knew about the wooden crates they would be placed in. There were large ones in which they could stand, sandwiched. And there were small ones in which the prisoners could only crouch -- sometimes for days at a time. 
Nils D. sported a typical Islamist beard. Whenever he went out, it was always dressed in black and with his face covered. He attended five executions as a spectator. "I had goosebumps all over," D. would later tell investigators with the State Office of Criminal Investigation in Düsseldorf. "But after a while it bounces off you." 
One time, he held a pistol to the back of the head of a bound prisoner and allowed himself to be photographed. Why? "It was incredibly stupid," he says today. "I'm sorry. The man probably didn't even notice." He claims that he never committed physical violence. Nils D. also denies reports that he abused or killed prisoners.
He told investigators there were several times when he wanted to leave the caliphate. One time a rebel offensive got in his way, and on another occasion a leader didn't want to send him to Germany on a mission. Nils D. claimed he would have used an attack order like that to escape and said he was not interested in acting on IS' behalf in Germany. At least by his own account.

'The Best Thing in the World Is Martyrdom'

But D. still hasn't made any statements about having broken with IS' ideology. He says he wanted to leave because the organization has built up a "total surveillance state."
He managed to get out in November 2014 under another false pretense. He told his superiors he wanted to bring his daughter to IS and traveled to Turkey with their permission. He didn't come back.
Once he had returned to his mother's place in Dinslaken, he only partly sought to resume normal life. "He wanted to go party, but that wasn't his thing," one of his friends told investigators. "He wanted to go to the brothel, but he couldn't work up the courage."
At the same time, he remained an open Islamist. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was "our president," and, "What he says, we have to do," he told one acquaintance. "The best, the very best thing in the world is martyrdom," he instructed his new girlfriend. When he found out that a close friend had died fighting, he took it as good news. "Of course I am pleased when my friend doesn't burn in hell," he would later say.
One day he began talking with an acquaintance about his time with IS in his car, which had been bugged. He spoke of the ID he had been given as a member of a special unit. That was enough for investigators. They arrested him in January 2015, three days after the attack on the French satire magazine Charlie Hebdo.
Initially, Nils D. had been far from willing to talk. He told one experienced anti-terror investigator that they had nothing concrete against him and they would "embarrass themselves in court." He even threatened to retaliate "once I'm out." 
Investigators then left and didn't return for months. After a while, however, they were able to reconstruct the data on his mobile phone. By that point, they were aware not only of the browser history with the porn, but also of the photo with the hooded prisoner and the images of his fellow fighters from Dinslaken. 
"That's when he changed his mind," the investigator who questioned Nils D. at the time told the court. When he spoke, he did so soberly, almost without emotion. But the exchange of glances between the investigator and Nils D. during his testimony indicated a certain amount of sympathy. The official had been sympathetic toward the terrorist because he had already testified over 40 times; and Nils D. toward the investigator because he had been fair to him. 

Connections Between Germany and Paris Attacks

D. has since let himself be interrogated even more. He disclosed the connections between the Paris attackers surrounding Abdelhamid Abaaoud and his accomplices in Dinslaken. He made it possible to initiate numerous investigative proceedings and trials. He described the structures of his special IS unit in greater detail than anyone before him.
He also provided new details about the leadership roles of Germans in IS. Among other things, he provided information about a previously unknown German who allegedly worked in the IS security apparatus under the nom de guerre "Abu Hager" -- a man who still has not been positively identified to this day. 
Nils D. has already completed more than one and a half years of his prison sentence, and it's possible he'll get released early for good behavior. He is also participating in a reintegration program organized by the State Office for the Protection of the Constitution in North Rhine-Westphalia, the agency responsible for monitoring extremist behavior in Germany. Intelligence officials and investigators describe him alternately as a "goldmine" of information or a "stroke of luck." Some even believe he could have made a good police officer. "He's got a gift for observation, a feel for hierarchies and an excellent memory," says one person.
But there's one aspect of policing he doesn't appear to be very skilled at: prevention. Despite his extensive testimony, Nils D. so far hasn't distanced himself from radical Islam. Or from the fact that Islamic State murders and terrorizes. That it has nothing to do with Islam. That the tales of heroism in the "caliphate" are nothing but propaganda. There hasn't been a single word about any of this from Nils D. So what is it that's driving him to come clean with officials?
"It can be assumed that one of the main reasons is the hope of a shorter prison sentence," says one high-ranking security official. "There's no such thing as instant de-radicalization. When someone has been in that deep, it takes months or even years."


Nils D. apparently hasn't made it that far. 
Harry S., on the other hand, has.
 


Complete dependence on someone makes you vulnerable to extortion. Back when the European Union sealed its refugee deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier this year, some were concerned he would use the agreement as leverage. Now Turkey's government has done just that. The Turkish foreign minister has warned Ankara will terminate the deal if the European Union doesn't grant visa-free travel for Turkish citizens within months.


To be sure, there are good reasons to grant Turks a visa waiver. But right now, it's especially important that Europe insist Ankara first meet the criteria the EU has determined necessary for that waiver to happen. That includes a reform of Turkey's anti-terror laws, which the government has been using to imprison political opponents without due process. The EU must not let itself be blackmailed by Erdogan, whose autocratic tendencies became visible once again during the last few weeks.
Turkey is in a dangerous state of crisis after last month's failed coup. Europe -- correctly -- condemned the attempted takeover by parts of the army, and now it must work to ensure that Erdogan returns to the rule of law. Turkish democracy is endangered by the post-coup purge, which included the dismissals and arrests of tens of thousands of lawyers, judges, journalists and members of the military. At the same time, an anti-Western sentiment has taken root in Turkish politics and society. The government in Ankara wrongly accuses Europe and the United States of not condemning the coup strongly enough or of secretly having supported it. This type of thinking is what spawned the threat to scuttle the refugee deal.
It's uncertain whether Turkey will ultimately make good on its ultimatum. That wouldn't be a very wise move, even from a Turkish perspective. For one, Erdogan would lose his most important piece of supposed leverage. Turkey also depends on Europe for its economic development; the newly rediscovered friendship between Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin offers no real alternative to the EU. But the Turkish president is an unpredictable actor and he doesn't always seem to act rationally.

Consequences Less Dramatic than Fears

If Turkey were to actually scrap the refugee deal, the consequences would likely be much less dramatic than many people fear. Sure, the flow of migrants to Europe would probably increase, but it's rather unlikely that tens of thousands of people would immediately start making their way to Europe. After all, it was the closure of the Balkan route -- not the deal with Turkey -- that was primarily responsible for staunching the flow of migrants heading north. Both measures together sent the message that the EU was no longer willing to accept uncontrolled migration to central Europe. More than anything, the refugee deal had symbolic power. To this day, Greece has not rejected a single Syrian who has applied for asylum. As of late July, only 468 people had been deported to Turkey. The announcement of the deal was sufficient -- it never had to truly come into force.
But no one can say what would happen if the agreement with Turkey were really terminated. For that reason, the EU must find its own alternative solution for dealing with refugees. Europe needs a Plan B without Erdogan, but two things must be considered: The kind of migration that we saw last year is not politically feasible in any European country, not even in Germany. Secondly, an equitable distribution of asylum-seekers across the entire EU in the future unfortunately seems unrealistic.


As long as things remain this way, there's only one option: The EU must use European funds to build refugee camps in Greece and Italy, where asylum applications can then be processed. This would, however, be a massive burden for the affected countries. At the same time, leaders of the EU member states need to create more opportunities for legal entry for asylum-seekers and compel at least some EU countries to accept refugees.
The worst-case scenario would be Greece turning into a bottleneck for refugees again. But it's more likely that many people will be deterred by the unattractiveness of crossing into Europe in the first place.
These are indeed depressing prospects, but the truth is that morally, it's not better to keep sending Ankara billions of euros in order to keep migrants in Turkey rather than accommodating them on European soil -- especially not when doing so puts you at the mercy of a man whose country could itself soon be the source of the next wave of political refugees.

The chancellor prefers her usual role, as the one calling for calm and levelheadedness. After a phone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Angela Merkel said there had been "worrisome developments" in Turkey in the wake of the military coup and that the opposition had been treated harshly.


But, she said, it was understandable that the government take action against the rebels and mentioned that Turkey had "been exemplary in its treatment of refugees." She argued that the priority should be "to keep the discussion going." As usual, Merkel adopted a let's wait and see approach.
The problem is that the chancellor's words didn't find much of an audience. Hardly had they appeared on the news ticker, did German and Turkish politicians set off an angry spiral of insults, threats and accusations. It almost seemed like coup supporters and opponents were now marching in protest in Ankara, Berlin and Brussels. 
Erdogan's foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, said the refugee agreement between Turkey and the European Union would be abandoned if Brussels didn't ease travel rules for Turkish people before October. In Germany, many politicians were also on a confrontation course. Arm in arm, Bavarian Governor Horst Seehofer of the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) and Baden-Württemberg Governor Winfried Kretschmann of the Green Party demanded the suspension of EU accession talks with Turkey. The head of the national Green Party, Cem Özdemir, argued for economic sanctions. And the human rights commissioner of the German government, Bärbel Kofler, a member of the center-left Social Democrats, also put the refugee agreement in question. She said the EU cannot "overlook" the fact that the processing of asylum applications in Turkey "does not follow the democratic rule of law."
Amid the bluster of ultimatums and counterultimatums, people overlooked the fact that the more levelheaded forces in Ankara and in the capitals of the EU were singing a very different tune. There may be no reason to fulfill Erdogan's wishes for the extradition of supposed coup supporters or to excuse his brutal measures against members of the opposition. And there are good arguments for admonishing Erdogan to return to the rule of law. 

Unlikely Defenders

But among the member states of the EU, there is an aversion to sharpening the conflict. According to experts, Ankara has thus far abided by the refugee agreement, which significantly aids the interests of both sides. The German security services believe that they can't do without their Turkish partners in the fight against Islamic terrorism. And more significantly, even many members of the Turkish opposition and opponents of the regime have warned the West that it shouldn't be too shrill in its criticism of Erdogan. 
Istanbul political scientist Nuray Mert, for example, is not someone you would expect to support autocratic Erdogan. She has repeatedly criticized the government in essays and interviews. In 2011, she lost her TV show on Turkish TV after Erdogan complained about her. 
Yet now, after the failed coup in July, she is defending the president against those who have been overzealous in vilifying him: "I support his government not only against any coup, but I also reject the Western coverage that depicts him as a monster." 
Politicians in Europe and the United States, she argues, have made too little of the fact that the majority of Turkish citizens and even the opposition was united in standing up against the military rebellion. "If our Western friends want to support democracy in Turkey, then they should have supported this broad anti-coup spirit."
That's how many supporters of the opposition see it. They oppose Erdogan's attempts to abolish democracy. They denounce the witch hunts against supposed followers of Islamist cleric Fethullah Gülen, whom the government sees as being behind the coup. But they also wish the West would offer more constructive criticism these days, along with greater encouragement.
"What we need now is unity and reconciliation, not more hatred," says the head of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), Selahattin Demirtas. Observers fear that overly curt opinions from Europe and the United States could drive the country further from the West. An atmosphere of opposition to the EU and the US is already spreading, even among liberal, pro-democratic Turks.
Erdogan has deliberately seized on these disappointments. "The West supports terrorism and sides with the people behind the coup," he told international investors in Ankara on Tuesday. Sinan Ülgen, a former Turkish diplomat and the head of Istanbul's Edam think tank, also accuses Western politicians of failing to clearly condemn the uprising. "If they had, their criticisms of anti-democratic developments would be much more credible," he says. The EU now needs to show "that it hasn't given up on Turkey yet."

Refugee Deal in Peril?

But in Europe, not many people are currently listening to the Turkish opposition. Lots of politicians are paying attention to Erdogan's worked-up tirades without noticing that his bluster is a bigger sign of weakness than strength.
This also isn't the first time the Turkish government has threatened to end the refugee deal if Brussels doesn't finally move to lift visa requirements for Turks entering the EU. Similar warnings had been uttered in the spring, but Ankara never followed through on them. In response, the EU acted in an unconventionally cohesive manner on the issue. As long as all of the criteria are not fulfilled, Brussels argued, there would be no freedom of travel.







AFP
Increased patrols by the Turkish coast guard has ensured a dramatic reduction in the number of refugees making their way to European shores.


Under the terms of the deal, Ankara is supposed to commit itself to bringing Turkish anti-terror laws in line with European law by mid-October. In the wake of the coup attempt, however, it is difficult to imagine that happening. Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn argues that more patience is needed with Turkey. He anticipates the talks will stretch on until "at least the end of the year."
The politician thinks it's unlikely Ankara will cancel the refugee deal. Erdogan has too big an interest in having a functioning relationship with Europe. Besides, the Turkish economy is at risk of crashing following the military coup. Ankara needs European capital and tourists in order to fill up the giant resorts on the Aegean once again. Asselborn is convinced that "the government could really use the  6 billion it has been pledged by 2018 as part of the refugee agreement."
Erdogan had also largely held to the terms of the agreement. In July, 60 refugees arrived in Greece every day. This past weekend, it was six. Before the EU-Turkey deal, over 1,000 refugees reached the Greek coast every day.
This decrease in numbers is not least due to the fact that countries like Slovenia and Macedonia closed the so-called Balkan Route. But neither Berlin nor Brussels has interest in a new experiment in which the Turkish coast guard shuts their eyes when boats take off toward the West. 
The fact that the EU is persistently pursuing its course of negotiation is also due to its lack of alternatives. Neither Berlin nor Brussels has a detailed Plan B. 
The European institutions -- the European Commission, European Parliament and European Council -- want to make a final decision on expanding the EU agency Frontex into a European border and coast guard in September, but it remains questionable whether that step would go far enough if Turkey were to once again open its borders and permit an exodus of migrants. There are currently 632 officials from other EU countries deployed in Greece on behalf of Frontex -- they control passports, take fingerprints and carry out repatriations. They work under the leadership of the Greeks, who have difficulties organizing their own people. If it came to a Plan B, the Greeks would require lots of help from Brussels and the other member states.

Crucial Cooperation

There's another reason the relationship with Turkey shouldn't be jeopardized lightly. In many cases, the authorities on both sides are frequently, silently working together. When it comes to the fight against the Islamic State (IS), authorities in Ankara play a key role.
Over 800 Islamists from Germany are believed to have traveled to Syria and Iraq in order to join IS or other terror groups. Most chose the land route via Turkey to get there. While the authorities there at first treated the jihad tourism nonchalantly, their collaboration with European intelligence services is now working at least selectively better.
In security circles, people are saying that "Turkey is an important and necessary partner" while wondering "in every specific case just how far the cooperation can go." The building of a joint terrorism database, recently made possible by a new law, wasn't in the cards before the coup and now it's even less of a possibility, especially given that Berlin and Ankara have very different definitions of what constitutes a terrorist.
But Erdogan doesn't shy away from any attempt to get the German government's support in his fight against the PKK, the militant pro-Kurdish party. In an apparent attempt to put pressure on Berlin, he claimed that his authorities had transferred "over 4,000" files about wanted terrorists to Germany, but that they were ignored by the Germans.


The responsible authorities have been trying to figure out what Erdogan meant ever since. In any case, a list with such a large number of suspects doesn't seem to exist. Furthermore, the number of extradition requests by Turkey has been manageable. According to the Federal Office of Justice, only 33 applicable requests have been received so far this year. Last year, there were a total of 65 requests. In 14 of the 33 cases, the Germans did move to extradite the suspect. The majority, the office says, were accused of assault, theft, drug crimes or murder. 
Despite irritations, contacts between the two countries are being maintained, as the example shows, but the mood is dark. As a result, many Turkey experts argue that the relationship between Berlin and Ankara should be rebalanced. They argue that the democratic powers in the country should be supported, that one should hold firm on joint projects and that Erdogan's impositions should be refuted where necessary. But to alienate the Turks, they argue, would be the wrong reaction.
Niels Annen, the foreign policy expert for the center-left Social Democrats, believes that a critical realignment is necessary. At the same time, he suggests that the government should "stay in dialogue" with the Turkish leadership so that Europe doesn't lose another partner and ally. "First Brexit, then Turkey -- that would be a catastrophe."

About Petra Thomas

Forum Anders Reisen



SPIEGEL ONLINE: Ms. Thomas, if I'm looking to take a sustainable vacation, I'm probably best advised to stay at home on my balcony, right?

Thomas: Pretty much. You don't produce many CO2 emissions on your balcony. But we don't want to discourage anyone from traveling -- we just want to sharpen their awareness of what responsible vacations are.

SPIEGEL ONLINE: Most Germans prefer to spend their time off in Germany.

Thomas: That doesn't necessarily mean they're adhering to a certain way of life, but nearby travel destinations that can be reached quickly are generally fairly sustainable. Much of that has to do with the fact that they are accessible by public transportation, such as trains.

SPIEGEL ONLINE: What is important to consider when planning a sustainable holiday?

Thomas: First of all, everyone should ask themselves: Why am I traveling? Am I looking for a cultural experience or to go to a spa? Then think about which places meet those criteria. You don't need to travel halfway around the world to find a spa -- it's enough to just go up to the Baltic Sea. And when you're packing, it's good to keep in mind that not all countries recycle their trash, so it's best to leave any packaging at home.

SPIEGEL ONLINE: And what about once you've reached your destination?

Thomas: It's best to frequent locally owned or family-run lodgings rather than international hotel chains. Additionally, you can eat at small restaurants, shop at markets and take three-wheeled rickshaw taxis whenever possible. That way you're supporting the local economy.

SPIEGEL ONLINE: Your website offers long-distance travel bookings. When is it OK to fly places?

Thomas: Taking ground transportation from Germany to India, for instance, is unrealistic. If there's no way to avoid flying, you should always try to book a direct flight. Every takeoff and landing causes additional emissions. Also, one long trip beats three short ones. The ratio of travel distance to holiday duration is an important factor. When it comes to CO2 emissions, a weekend trip to New York doesn't make a lot of sense. After such a long-haul flight, you should plan to stay at your destination for at least two weeks.

SPIEGEL ONLINE: But I could buy green airline miles for my New York trip at Atmosfair. Wouldn't that be enough of an indulgence?

Thomas: I don't like the word "indulgence." In its original Catholic meaning, that was how sinners bought their salvation, and that's not at all what Atmosfair is about. The money is invested in regional climate protection projects that use new technology to improve people's lives. The principle is comparable to a customary tourist tax, thanks to which beaches are kept clean, for instance. It's remarkable that such a thing hasn't been implemented yet for air travel.

SPIEGEL ONLINE: You run Forum Anders Reisen, which bundles together 130 tour operators and travel agents that have committed themselves to sustainability. Your list of criteria is 12 pages long. What does an operator have to fulfill in order to become a member?

Thomas: Is the journey to get there eco-friendly? Are room and board in the destination country provided by locals, so that the money supports the local economy? Are the local culture and nature respected? And most importantly, we're part of the service industry, so there are many people involved who should be able to live from the work they do and, ideally, also have a say in decisions.

SPIEGEL ONLINE: A number of countries that rely on tourism, such as states in the Maghreb region or Egypt, have become politically unstable. What do you recommend: Should people avoid these countries or support them?

Thomas: There's no general answer to that. First of all, no one should travel to any country where their safety is at risk. But the question of whether your money is going to support dictators is one that we should all be asking ourselves. North Korea, for instance, wouldn't be an option because there's no private infrastructure. It's worth looking into whether human rights, protection of endangered species or child labor are issues in a certain country. And not being able to move around freely is a problem, too. However, boycotting a country tends to adversely affect the wrong people. Burma is a good counter-example: Tourism contributed massively to the country opening itself to the outside world.

SPIEGEL ONLINE: Vacations where people can work on social or environmental projects -- so-called voluntourism -- are becoming increasingly trendy. It sounds sustainable, but in fact it's controversial. How do you deal with that?

Thomas: We had to expand our criteria to encompass this new kind of travel. We're very critical of stays at orphanages, where children are briefly looked after by people who lack any educational training and then left again. On the other hand, there's nothing wrong with voluntourism projects in the Black Forest, where you can help collect dead wood after severe storms.

SPIEGEL ONLINE: How cheap is too cheap for a vacation if you want to be sustainable?

Thomas: When you look at the price of a trip, it's easy to calculate whether the cost is realistic. Take, for instance, 1,000 euros ($1,119) for an all-inclusive vacation in the Dominican Republic in a four-star hotel. You can safely assume that the hotel personnel are not being fairly compensated. At a price like that, a company is probably skimping on working conditions.



SPIEGEL ONLINE: According to the tourism research association FUR, at least two out of three Germans say that sustainability is important to them while on vacation -- but their bookings suggest otherwise. How can this be?

Thomas: We're very conscientious in our daily lives when it comes to using renewable energy or buying organic food, but sustainable vacations are going to take some time to catch on. One reason for this could be that the package tour market in Germany is dominated by seven corporations that account for 70 percent of sales. It's tough to find sustainable offers.

SPIEGEL ONLINE: Have you taken a vacation yet this year?

Thomas: No, but I'm leaving soon. I'm going hiking in South Tyrol -- and I'm taking the train to get there.



Transcripts of chats obtained by German authorities indicate that the two men involved in attacks in the German cities of Ansbach and Würzburg had repeated contact with suspected members of Islamic State via telephone numbers registered in Saudi Arabia, among other places, SPIEGEL has learned. Würzburg perpetrator Riaz Khan Ahmadzai, who is believed to have originated from Afghanistan and seriously injured several people on a regional train with an axe and knife on July 18, also left a goodbye message before engaging in the attack. "We'll see each other in paradise," he wrote.


In chats conducted prior to the attack, an IS contact man suggested to the 17-year-old that he drive a car into a mass of people. The perpetrator rejected the suggestion, justifying himself by saying he didn't have a driver's license. Instead, Ahmadzai announced, he would board a train and attack the first passengers that are convenient. 
In the case of the other attack in Ansbach, committed by Mohammed Daleel of Syria, the authorities believe the perpetrator's death on July 24 was likely an accident. They think his intention had been to deposit a backpack carrying homemade explosives within a crowd at a music festival in the city before detonating it remotely. 
Shortly before the attack, his chat contact had called on him to film the detonation and the ensuing inferno and to send the video to IS. But it appears the explosive detonated prematurely, killing Daleel and injuring 15 others. There is discussion in the chats of Daleel perpetrating further attacks. Daleel's face is concealed behind a veil in the video in which he claims responsibility for the attacks, which investigators view as a sign that he may have been planning further ones. Investigators also found further bomb-making materials in the apartment where he was staying.

A short ride from Manila -- depending on traffic -- the jail isn't an imposing building, or even a particularly large one. Its total floor area is a shade over 30,000 square feet. More than 4,000 inmates -- and counting -- live cheek by jowl in what has to be one of the most densely populated corners of the Philippines. It's always been packed, guards say, but recently the number of inmates has spiked. Critics say this overcrowding is a predictable effect of President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs -- a crackdown the pugnacious new leader promised in the campaign that propelled him into office.Conditions inside are astounding. Every available space is crammed with yellow T-shirted humanity. The men here -- and almost 60% are in for drug offenses -- spend the days sitting, squatting and standing in the unrelenting, suffocating Manila heat.Their numbers are climbing relentlessly. At the beginning of the year, a little under 3,600 were incarcerated. In the seven weeks since Duterte took office and charged his No. 1 cop, Ronald Dela Rosa, with cleaning up the country, that number has risen to 4,053.The Quezon City Jail was built in 1953, originally to house 800 people, according to the country's Bureau of Jail Management and Penology standards. The United Nations says it should house no more than 278.There are only 20 guards assigned to the mass of incarcerated men, some of whom have been living behind these walls for years without ever seeing the inside of a courtroom. Dela Rosa earlier told CNN that the criminals in the jails and prisons would just have to squeeze in, gesturing by pulling in his shoulders and arms.Inmates are woken at 5 a.m. before undergoing a head count -- no easy task when you have 4,000-plus men crammed into crumbling, ramshackle cells.'Safer in here than out on the streets'Alex Beltran, a 29-year-old temp worker, has been here for a month and blames Duterte's crackdown for his imprisonment. "The food is terrible," he says. "And it's hard to find a space to sleep, especially when it rains."Life inside is "harder for the new guys," he says. Fellow inmate Romeo Payhoi, 38, is another newcomer, and while he says he was scared coming in, it hasn't been as bad as he anticipated, just cramped and lacking any privacy. At any rate, he adds, he feels "safer in here than out on the streets," where "the cops could kill you."Many who come into the system are already affiliated with gangs, like Sique-sique Sputnik (935 members incarcerated in the jail), Commando (386), Bahala Na gang (874) and Batang City Jail (740). Around a quarter of those inside the jail have no affiliation.These gangs hold considerable sway inside, and each run sections to which their members naturally gravitate. Colorful murals on the walls proclaim territory, although guards say that out of sheer necessity there is a de facto truce between the groups. Many inmates could go home but can't afford the bail, which can be as low as 4,000 to 6,000 pesos ($86 to $129), according to Joey Doguiles, the jail's senior inspector and chief of operations. A top police chief, when asked what officials did to prepare for the crackdown, said the threat from drugs was so great that there was no time to expand the facility. That would have to come later.Outside the jail as many as 700 relatives of inmates wait patiently in the still morning air to go in to see their brothers, husbands and sons. They'll be waiting for hours before adding to the crush inside -- one guard says that there isn't a specific visiting room; visitors mingle with prisoners, marked with ink stamp to denote their freedom. A rigorous search of those coming from the outside keeps the amount of contraband to a minimum, Doguiles says. But it's still a jail, he shrugs, suggesting that drugs and other illegal goods do find their way in. The main drug here -- as it is across the Philippines -- is shabu, the local name for meth. Bunks stacked at least three highInside the dormitories -- affectionately called barangays, a Filipino name for neighborhoods -- the men are left to their own devices to find somewhere to sleep. Towels, threadbare curtains and even chipped plywood boards are put up to maintain some semblance of privacy, but it's impossible in such a cramped space. In one room there are 85 inmates in a 200-square foot space. Another one, bigger but not by much, holds 131. It's designed for 30. Bunks are stacked at least three high, and inmates have even crawled under these rickety structures to find a sleeping spot. One sleeps, cocooned, in a hammock suspended from the ceiling.And they don't even have the comfort of knowing that this is a temporary situation. The court system here works at a snail's pace. An endless waitAmeena-Tara Jance visits six days a week to see her husband, who's been here for six years and counting. He's recovering from a mild stroke, and she says that in the heat some have been known to keel over and die. Her husband is due for another hearing in October, but they both feel there's no end in sight. "There's no justice," she says. The "mayor" of the second-floor dorms, Ramon Go -- an inmate responsible for marshaling and supervising around 900 of his fellow prisoners -- has been there for 16 years. He's one of the few who's had his trial -- on murder charges -- after a police raid led to a cop's shooting death. He was tried 2½ years ago -- after almost a decade and a half of waiting -- and is still stuck inside the walls of the jail in Quezon City, waiting for the verdict to come in. With thousands of arrests made since the beginning of June in the war on drugs, the population of inmates keeps growing. It's an endless wait, made keener by the fact that the inmates can't know when they might regain their freedom. So they wait, watching daily as more caught up in the crackdown are processed and attempt to eke out a space, and a life, in a jail already breaking at the seams.CNN's Ivan Watson and Kathy Quiano and journalist Charie Villa contributed to this report.
"We are certainly not leaving the U.N.," Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay said. "As I've said, the statement of the president is a statement expressing profound disappointment and frustration, and it is not any statement that should indicate a threat to leave the United Nations."President Rodrigo Duterte threatened to leave the U.N. in a speech Sunday after receiving criticism of his approach to drug crime since taking office. The pugnacious new leader made the comments in Davao City, the southern Filipino city where he served as mayor for over two decades. "Maybe we'll just have to decide to separate from the United Nations," he said in English during the address. "If you are that insulting, son of a bitch, we should just leave," he said then in Tagalog, according to a translation by CNN affiliate CNN Philippines. "Take us out of your organization. You have done nothing anyway."He accused the U.N. of ignoring the plight of the country. "When were you here last time? Nothing. Never. Except to criticize."The comments come days after the U.N. urged Duterte's administration to step back from its violent approach to drug crime.The crackdown since Duterte took office in late June has seen over 650 police killings -- deaths Duterte and his top police officer, Roland Dela Rosa, say are justified self-defense killings -- alongside as many as 900 unexplained murders perpetrated by suspected vigilantes. Duterte has also publicly accused dozens of officials and politicians of being involved in the drug trade.U.N. urges end to extrajudicial killingsThe U.N. has condemned the approach. "Allegations of drug-trafficking offenses should be judged in a court of law, not by gunmen on the streets," a report released Thursday quotes human rights experts as saying. "We call on the Philippines authorities to adopt with immediate effect the necessary measures to protect all persons from targeted killings and extrajudicial executions," the new U.N. Special Rapporteur on summary executions, Agnes Callamard, said in the report."Claims to fight illicit drug trade do not absolve the government from its international legal obligations and do not shield state actors or others from responsibility for illegal killings."Duterte's undiplomatic style has landed him in hot water before. He recently insulted the US Ambassador to the Philippines, calling him a "gay son of a bitch," and prior to taking office used similarly colorful language to complain that Pope Francis' visit to the country had resulted in traffic jams. Popular leaderDuterte enjoys high levels of support among Filipinos, who he says are tired of the scourge of drugs. However,  the new president's approach to drug crime is facing scrutiny within the country, with one of Duterte's most vocal opponents, Senator Leila de Lima, conducting an inquiry into the high numbers of drug-related deaths since he took office.The senator has called Dela Rosa to a senate hearing on the issue.Last week, in a speech to police officials, Duterte launched a deeply personal attack on de Lima, shocking many Filipinos. Duterte stands by his tactics, which he says are justified in ridding the country of drugs."My orders are for the police to go out and hunt for criminals," he said. 'I tell them to arrest these criminals if they surrender peacefully, but kill them if they put up a violent struggle. I assume full responsibility for what happens."
Now imagine that candidate wins.Welcome to the Philippines, where Rodrigo Duterte, also known as "The Punisher" assumed the presidency on June 30. The experience should prove informative for people considering the election of another "tell-it-like-it-is" politician, America's very own Donald J. Trump.Duterte just caused an international incident when he called the US ambassador a "gay son of a bitch," during a recent speech to a military group. He claimed he used those words in a conversation with Secretary of State John Kerry when Kerry was visiting the Philippines. Duterte recounted for his audience how he complained to Kerry about Ambassador Philip Goldberg, one of America's most senior diplomats, because he interfered with the election by "giving statements here and there."The State Department immediately called in the Philippines' representative in Washington to seek "a better understanding of why the statement was made," according to spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau. What's to understand? The candidate who campaigned with insults and threats is now governing with insults and threats. Much worse, it turns out his campaign threats, even the most outrageous, were not empty.Damage to the Philippines' international relations and diplomatic crises are the least of it.Duterte's brand new administration already has the worst traits of an emerging fascist dictatorship. Cross the thin-skinned strongman at your own risk.Like Trump, Duterte came across as a plainspoken strongman. He attracted voters with promises to tackle the country's problems without regard for the niceties of human rights or the trivial objections of the elites. He vowed to clean the streets of criminals and drug dealers. He said he would fill Manila Bay with the corpses of criminals.His previous pronouncements were just as shocking, and he refused to apologize for anything he had said or done. The US ambassador apparently "pissed off" the President when he criticized an astonishing joke by Duterte at a campaign rally about the rape and murder of an Australian missionary in the city of Davao when Duterte was mayor there. Duterte said, "I was angry she was raped, yes, that was one thing. But she was so beautiful, I think the mayor should have been first. What a waste." The comment sparked criticism not only from the American envoy but also many others. Duterte refused to apologize, and when his party expressed regrets on his behalf he disavowed the apology. Apologizing is anathema to would-be strongmen, who portray themselves as infallible and all-powerful.To those who could not conceive of Dutarte's scandalous, lawbreaking promises becoming reality, his 5-week-old administration is coming as a shock. Those who feared it would be bad are watching in astonishment as the reality surpasses their fears.On June 25, several days before taking office, he addressed a crowd gathered in Davao to celebrate his victory. In the speech, broadcast nationwide, he announced a crackdown on drug dealers, telling people to turn them in or just kill them. "Shoot him," he said, "and I'll give you a medal."In the five weeks since he took office, hundreds have been murdered, killed without facing a judge, a jury or a trial. A local newspaper has a regularly updated "Kill List," to track "the casualties of Duterte's war on crime." Their count is 611 since the election. Other tallies top 1,000.The stunning provocation alarmed many Filipinos, including Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Maria Lourdes Sereno, who issued a letter politely urging the President to respect the "constitutional order." The President warned the Supreme Court that if it gets in his way he would order the executive branch not to obey the court. And he said he might declare martial law. That, in effect, would make him a dictator.In less than two months, the President is threatening to dismantle democracy and set supposedly co-equal branches of government at war with each other. One member of Congress implored the President and the justice to "work together for the good of the country."The President is not content to attack judges, criminals, and others in government who might interfere with his plans. If Duterte doesn't like you, whatever the reason, the future looks bleak. He has already declared that some journalists should be killed. And refused to apologize.If the business community thought they'd have a champion in the executive mansion they're thinking again.On August 3, the President started to unveil his war on powerful business figures. "I am fighting a monster," he said, "... believe me, I will destroy their clutches in our country." Then he went on to name some of the "monsters" he planned to destroy, wealthy individuals in a number of industries.Among those he listed was Roberto Ongpin, chairman of of PhilWeb, a major publicly traded gaming technology firm. PhilWeb stock nosedived and Ongpin resigned.In this new world, Duterte decides who stays and who goes. If you want to stay, Duterte has to like you. Not all billionaires are monsters in his eyes. Gina Lopez, for example, a wealthy member of his Cabinet, doesn't have to be destroyed because, "She's a billionaire. But she's a crusader," the President explained. "She loves the country and she hates oligarchs."Can the Philippines' hard-won democracy survive the Duterte autocracy? We will see. But for voters in others countries, enticed by this global wave of alluring autocrats -- including the United States and Donald Trump -- the disturbing news from the Philippines is a cautionary tale. Sometimes the hyperbole of the campaign trail is not hyperbole. Sometimes what you hear on the trail is just a preview of worse to come.Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent.

On Monday, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, speaking to reporters in the capital of Ankara, said Turkey does not know who was behind the attack. He said it's unclear at the present time whether the attacker was "a child or an adult."It is rumored that the attacker was a child, Yildirim said."The security forces are focusing on it and trying to find clues related to it," the prime minister said.Many of those killed were young teensTwenty-two of the 54 killed in a devastating bomb attack that struck the wedding were under 14, a Turkish official said Monday.The revelation added a fresh layer of horror to the bombing, which also wounded dozens of others. It was the deadliest in a string of blasts across Turkey this year.The bomb struck in crowded streets of the Beybahce neighborhood of Gaziantep's Sahinbey district during celebrations for the wedding of a Kurdish couple. The blast disproportionately killed women and children, as it had been timed to detonate during a part of the festivities when those groups painted themselves with henna, authorities said.As the dead were swiftly laid to rest, in accordance with Islamic tradition, their loved ones spoke of their anguish.Emine Ayhan, who lost four of her five children and whose husband was seriously injured, told Turkish television: "If my remaining child was not alive, I would commit suicide." Hakki Okur, 14, was among the young victims. His cousin, Mesut Bozkurt, recounted searching for the teen throughout the night following the blast before his family was summoned to the hospital to identify his body."No injuries on his head, but burns on his chest," Bozkurt said. "We think he may have been trapped in the panic since he was a skinny boy."Erdogan: Bomber also a young teenAuthorities found remnants of an explosive vest at the scene, and officials said they are not clear whether it was detonated remotely or by the bomber. ISIS, which has struck before in Gaziantep and reportedly has a strong presence in the city, traditionally hasn't claimed responsibility for attacks on Turkish soil.Gaziantep is about 95 kilometers (60 miles) north of the war-torn Syrian city of Aleppo.Child bomber thwarted in IraqOn Sunday, a would-be child bomber was captured by security guards in Kirkuk -- a city in northern Iraq with a large Kurdish population. Broadcaster Kurdistan 24 aired footage of guards apprehending the teen and stripping him of his suicide vest before he could strike.Najmaldin Karim, the governor of Kirkuk province, told CNN that the thwarted bomber was a 15-year-old who arrived from Mosul -- the largest city under ISIS control --  a week earlier. Following an earlier suicide attack in the city Sunday, the guards noticed something odd about the teen and stopped him before he struck his target, a Shia mosque."He is trained and brainwashed," Karim told CNN."They tell them if they do this, they will go to heaven and have a good time and get everything that they ever wanted."Mia Bloom, a Georgia State University professor who is an expert on child soldiers and terrorism, said ISIS made wide use of children in conflict, typically employing them as bombers or snipers, either attached to adult fighting units or operating on their own.The organization has eulogized more than 250 child attackers on its channels on Telegram, an encrypted messaging app the terror group widely uses.ISIS has lured children "through a variety of tricks and treats, the way pedophiles lure in young kids," she said.But often -- if child soldiers are internally displaced persons, as the thwarted Kirkuk bomber was reported to be, or otherwise vulnerable -- they may feel "that they had no choice but to join ... perhaps in exchange for food or protection or not upsetting the authorities in Raqqa or in Mosul."Child bombers who are coerced often deliberately fail to launch their attacks, as the teen in Kirkuk may have done, she said.Pro-Kurdish party struckTurkish news agency DHA broadcast footage showing the bride and groom overcome by emotion as they returned to the blast site at an apartment building that was home to the groom's parents and where the newlyweds were to live after their wedding. Distraught to revisit the scene of so much bloodshed, the couple were rushed back to the hospital for treatment, with the overwhelmed bride carried into the ward by her husband and a relative.The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party said in a statement condemning the blast that the wedding was for one of its members. It added that the bombing, which it said had killed many children and women, resembled other suspected ISIS attacks on the party in Turkey, such as in Suruc in July 2015 and in Ankara in October. The latter attack, targeting a peace rally near the capital's central railway station, claimed more than 100 lives, making it the deadliest terror attack in modern Turkish history."Over the years, Gaziantep has gradually become a nest for ISIS," said the statement from the party's Central Executive Board. "The people of Gaziantep have been living in an environment with ISIS members who amass weapons and organize mass meetings."The statement criticized Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party for failing to prevent such attacks and said its "hate speech, discriminating and dividing attitude in democratic political arenas furnishes the conditions" for such acts.Relations between the government and Turkey's Kurdish minority have been strained as a result of a decades-long Kurdish insurgency.Kurds targeted by ISISThe Kurds have become key American allies in the battle against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, placing Kurdish targets squarely in the Sunni terror group's cross hairs. Kurdish militia played a central role in driving the group from the Syrian city of Manbij this month, cutting a main supply route from the Turkish border to its heartland in Raqqa.ISIS operatives have struck before in the bustling southern Turkish city of about 1.5 million people, with the group claiming responsibility for the shootings of anti-ISIS activists there in December and April.The terror group has been blamed for a series of bomb attacks throughout Turkey, which allows planes from the US-led anti-ISIS coalition to operate from its air base at Incirlik.ISIS is believed to have extensive cells throughout Turkey. Citing Turkish security sources, Anadolu reported last month that 5,300 suspected ISIS members had been detained in Turkey.Ongoing turmoilEven before the attempted July 15 coup, Turkey had experienced a year of bloodshed and political turmoil, weathering a string of deadly bomb blasts, blamed variously on ISIS and the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or the PKK.In attacks last week, 11 people were killed and hundreds injured in three bombings targeting security forces in eastern Turkey. The Turkish government blamed the PKK, which has typically targeted police and the military, whereas ISIS tends to launch mass casualty attacks on soft, civilian targets.Clashes between the PKK and Turkish forces have flared up again since a peace process crumbled in 2015, bringing an end to a two-year ceasefire.CNN's Tim Hume wrote and reported from London, and Isil Sariyuce and Ben Wedeman reported from Gaziantep. CNN's Joe Sterling, Ghazi Balkiz, Robyn Curnow, Karen Smith, Carol Jordan and Joel Williams also contributed to this report.
The footage appears to show security personnel restrain a visibly upset boy while they carefully cut the belt from the youth's torso in Kirkuk. Once the belt has been removed, the boy is scooped up and taken away. Kurdistan 24, a broadcast news station based out of Irbil, Iraq, aired Sunday's capture.Authorities said they believe the 15-year-old came to Kirkuk a week ago from Mosul, ISIS' most significant stronghold outside Syria."He was captured before he reached his destination, which was a Shia mosque," Najmaldin Karim, the governor of Kirkuk Governorate, told CNN. "The security guards noticed there was something wrong, especially that there was another suicide attack a bit earlier, and they captured him." Karim said the terrorist organization "trained and brainwashed" the boy. "They tell them if they do this, they will go to heaven and have a good time and get everything that they ever wanted," he said.The arrest in Kirkuk comes a day after a child bomber is believed to have targeted a Kurdish wedding in Turkey, killing at least 54 people. More than 20 of the victims were children under 14, a Turkish official said Monday. 'Cubs of the caliphate'ISIS has a history of exploiting children through propaganda, but more recently it has used them as weapons on the front lines and to target civilians. The terrorist group maintains an army of child soldiers -- stolen from their families and indoctrinated to their cause. These so-called cubs of the caliphate are inducted into ISIS' campaign of violence through a myriad of grim training practices, with children as young as 8 reconditioned to follow the terror group's ideology, according to UN reports. "We have had reports of children, especially children that are mentally challenged, who have been used as suicide bombers, most probably without them even understanding what has happened or what they have to expect," Renate Winter, an expert with the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, told CNN in 2015. The group is believed to use threats, intimidation and an unrelenting endurance training to break down the children. In some instances, young boys are forced to witness ISIS militants shoot fellow recruits if they stop participating in drills. ISIS' deadly recruiting campaignThe jihadi movement is also believed to have seized schools to re-educate and radicalize children to follow the group's extreme interpretation of Islam. Human Rights Watch has said that ISIS and other extremist groups "have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks, including suicide bombing missions."These terror tactics involving children have remained a top concern among lawmakers and human rights organizations. The first open source database documenting ISIS child propaganda was launched this year after 13 months of study. Researchers estimated around 1,500 child soldiers are training and fighting in the terror group's ranks. "They are not just being used to shock people in execution videos. They are being used for their operational value as well," Charlie Winter, the study's co-author, told CNN in February. "This is something that sadly we have to expect to increase and accelerate as the situation becomes more precarious for ISIS in the years to come."ISIS is not the only terror group known to use child soldiers. Reports have emerged of children exploited by Boko Haram in Nigeria and Al-Shabaab in Somalia.  
Story highlightsConservative politician Nicolas Sarkozy was France's leader from 2007 to 2012"I felt I had the strength to lead this battle during this troubled time of our history," he wroteThe 61-year-old broke the news on his official Twitter account Monday, as he tweeted an excerpt from his forthcoming book, "Tout pour la France" ( All for France)."I decided to run for the 2017 presidential election. France demands that we give her everything. I felt I had the strength to lead this battle during this troubled time of our history," the excerpt reads.France has been under a state of emergency since the Paris terror attacks in November, when an ISIS cell killed 130 in the French capital. Last month, another ISIS attacker drove his lorry through crowds of people celebrating Bastille Day in Nice, killing more than 80.Sarkozy, leader of the center-right Republicans party, was president from 2007 to 2012, when he was defeated by France's current president Francois Hollande, of the center-left Socialist Party.
Singer Charlotte Campbell dances on the spot around a microphone stand decorated with fairy lights, as a passer-by throws a handful of coins into her guitar case. It looks like being a long and profitable night.Campbell, 26, grew up on the far reaches of the Central Line, in the northwestern outskirts of London. Now she spends several days a week busking below ground.She's one of thousands of people enjoying the festive atmosphere on a historic night for London -- after more than 150 years the Tube will run 24 hours a day on Friday and Saturdays. CNN took to the trains on Friday, riding around the capital, talking to people traveling and working below the streets on the night when London truly became a 24-hour city.Buzz of excitementIt's 11.20pm, the bars and restaurants of the West End are still packed, people are spilling out onto the streets, weaving their way around neatly-stacked pyramids of trash from the stores nearby.Tourists dance as a percussionist bashes out a tune on plastic pots and metal pans, and a queue forms at a noodle bar.At Oxford Circus, the city's busy shopping street, tattered copies of the Evening Standard newspaper litter the steps as people stream down into the station."There's a real buzz tonight," says Steve Griffiths, London Underground's CEO, who is excited to see the long-awaited Night Tube finally become a reality, following numerous false starts along the way."London is a 24/7 city, and it needs a transport system that enables that — not just for the social scene, but for people working in London," Griffiths says. He expects 100,000 additional passengers every Friday and Saturday night, and thinks the numbers could go higher.Whoops of joy"It's a relief to be up and running," says station worker Latoya, who has been doing night shifts since April to prepare.As incomers whoop with joy to discover that the trains really are still running, Latoya grins."There's so much excitement, I've seen people screaming when they come down the stairs," she says. "Thanks for working so late guys, this is awesome," one thrilled customer tells station staff working on the ticket gate.Just after midnight, Marcus Edwards, from Wimbledon, says he is "not heading home just yet," because he's off into town to meet some friends to go dancing in Piccadilly. "Usually people are rushing to get the last train, but that won't happen now — it means they'll be able to spend more time with friends."At 12.30am, when Oxford Circus station would normally be shutting, one of its three departures boards goes blank: there will be no more Bakerloo Line trains tonight, but the Central and Victoria lines will keep running: One train each way every 10 minutes, right through until the morning.Drunken argumentsAn hour later on the Central Line, it's hot, sticky and almost as busy as rush hour.A girl sits on the westbound platform cradling her phone, tears staining her cheeks, as wobbly drunks prop themselves up against the wall and stare, unfocused, into the distance, awaiting the next train.Heading east out of London, a tipsy trio of girlfriends are clutching greasy brown paper bags from McDonald's and arguing good-naturedly about their respective routes home."I'm definitely more drunk than I've ever been on the normal Tube," says a twenty-something guy, swinging from the overhead hand rail.Next to me, two women debate whether 2.30am is too early to arrive wherever it is they are heading; their night is just getting started. For others, the fun is well and truly over, they doze fitfully, green around the gills and swaying along with the movement of the train.Missed stopsThe carriage gradually empties as we head further east. By the time we reach the end of the line at 2.42am, there are just four others in the carriage, two of them asleep.It turns out they've missed their stop after a heavy night out in town, and — like me — have to turn around and head back the way we just came; a few stops later they're almost home, after briefly getting stuck in the doors.At Leytonstone, I meet three teenagers tripping barefoot along the platform, vertiginous heels in hand, with friends Meg Abery and Emily Smith; they've been to Faces, a nightclub famous for its appearances in reality TV show "The Only Way is Essex," to celebrate their A-level results."... normally we'd have had to get a £30 ($39.40) or £40 ($52.54) cab, and this is much cheaper, plus it's peace of mind for my parents."The train west is delayed while cleaners are called in to deal with what the driver calls a "situation" (translation: a large puddle of vomit) in one of the carriages, but we're kept entertained by a girl wearing a bright yellow "Caution: Wet Floor" cone on her head on the opposite platform.Heading homeAt Liverpool Street Station, groups sprawl on the floor outside the station eating junk food. Tracey Harknett, her partner and three children have just arrived back in London after a holiday in Turkey -- thanks to the Night Tube, they're looking forward to being home in time for breakfast."We'd have no other way of getting home at this time. If only the Jubilee line was open, we'd be there much sooner. We're dying to get home for a bacon sarnie!"Early starts, late finishesBy 5am, the escalators and passageways at Oxford Circus are quieter than they were a couple of hours ago, and the mood has shifted: there are still pockets of people heading home, but most passengers are just beginning their day: bleary-eyed and yawning.Sebastian Cringaci, originally from Romania, is on a southbound Victoria line train, heading to work in East Croydon. He's already a big fan of the new service."It makes a major difference to me," he explains. "This morning I got the 4.38am train, instead of getting up at 3.50am to start my shift at 6am! It will make my life much easier — on weekends at least. It means I get half an hour or three quarters of an hour extra sleep."At the taxi rank near the station in Vauxhall, cabs are lined up waiting for their fares. Richard Amoah says business is slow, but he and his fellow drivers blame Uber, rather than the Night Tube."It's been a very quiet night," he says. "But I don't think that's because of the Tube being open — that's not impacting us, yet. It might do at a later stage."Back across the river at Warren Street, station cleaner Hristina Duzoda is celebrating the end of her overnight shift with a breakfast of sushi, eaten in the street."We weren't too busy here, compared to some of the other stations, but there were lots of young people, and everyone was really happy," she says before going back inside to grab her bag. London may officially now be a city that never sleeps, but she needs to: she's due back at work by 11pm.
Story highlightsS R Nathan's presidency was the longest in Singapore's history"He was a true son of Singapore," Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong saysThree weeks ago, Nathan had suffered a stroke, Lee said. According to Reuters, the stroke was his second in recent years, with the latest having placed him in critical condition. Nathan, who held office from 1999 to 2011, was the longest-serving president of Singapore, according to Lee. The Prime Minister described Nathan as a "warm and approachable" leader who "impressed visitors with his knowledge of world affairs, and served with dignity and distinction.""He was a true son of Singapore," Lee added.Born in 1924, Nathan was raised in Muar, Malaysia, before moving with his family to Singapore. He worked for the Japanese during World War II as a translator and later a civilian police official. After the war ended, he climbed through Singapore's bureaucratic ranks, holding a number of roles in security and foreign affairs, and was an ambassador to the United States.  In a statement, current Singaporean President Tony Tan praised Nathan for establishing the Institute for Defence and Strategic Studies, an influential think tank in Southeast Asia, and the President's Challenge, an annual philanthropic campaign.In 2009, Nathan signed off on the unprecedented use of $4.9 billion from Singapore's national reserves to curb the effects of the Great Recession. As the economy recovered, he decided not to seek a third presidential term.After his presidency, Nathan went on to hold several academic appointments, launched an educational fund to assist disadvantaged students and published two memoirs as well as a children's book. Three years ago, Nathan was the recipient of the Order of Temasek, one of Singapore's most prestigious awards.A state funeral service will be held Friday at the University Cultural Centre, according to Lee's office. CNN's Andreena Narayan contributed to this report. 
On Monday, Iranian news agency IRNA quoted Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi, who called Moscow's use of the bases a "temporary mission, that ended.""Russia has no base in Iran nor has it deployed (its fighter jets) in our country," Qassemi said, according to IRNA.In Moscow, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov confirmed in an email statement that Russian military units that were using Iran's Hamadan Air Base have "successfully completed all the tasks."However, Konashevkov suggested Russian warplanes might return in the future "on the basis of mutual agreements on combating terrorism," the statement said.Moscow's announcement of the new arrangement last week is being described by Iran's Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan as showing off and a "betrayal of trust," Reuters reported, citing Iran's Fars news agency.The arrangement had raised eyebrows in Washington, triggering a spat with Moscow over a UN resolution, because it was the first such operation by a major power since Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979.Though Russia insists its pilots have been targeting ISIS forces, Washington says the majority of its airstrikes have been against US-backed rebels battling forces loyal to Syrian President Bashir Assad. The airstrikes have helped Assad retake territory lost to ISIS and other rebel groups.Iran allowing Russia to house its bombers represents "a major strategic shift in the Middle East" that's likely to frustrate US efforts to contain Iran's influence in the region, said analyst Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Cordesman predicted that Washington would consider pushing back by taking the issue to the UN.In fact, US State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters Tuesday that Russia's use of the Iranian airfield "could very well be a violation of [UN] Resolution 2231," which prohibits the transfer of combat aircraft to Iran.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov rejected that suggestion."There are no reasons to suspect Russia of violating resolution 2231," Lavrov said during a news conference Wednesday. "Neither supply nor transfer or sale of military aircraft to Iran took place."As Iran's Secretary of Supreme National Security Council Ali Shamkhani put it Tuesday in an interview with IRNA: Tehran and Moscow "enjoy strategic cooperation in the fight against terrorism in Syria and share their facilities and capacities to this end."The spat raised questions about the prospect of proposed US-Russia cooperation on fighting ISIS and Jabhat Fateh Al-Sham, formerly known al Qaeda's Syria affiliate, the Nusra front.The US expects the deal will include a grounding of Assad's air force in exchange for providing more information to the Russians about US missions.Toner said Tuesday that Russia's actions did "not preclude the fact that we will reach some kind of cooperative arrangement with Russia. We continue to pursue that."Moscow had deployed Tu-22M3 long-range bombers and Su-34 tactical bombers to Hamedan, which is located in western Iran.Airstrikes launched from there hit targets belonging to ISIS and the Jabhat al-Nusra militant group in the Syrian provinces of Aleppo, Deir Ezzor and Idlib, Russia's defense ministry said.A "significant number of militants" were also thought to be killed, the ministry said.All Russian aircraft returned to their home airfields safely after a successful "combat mission," the statement added.US Secretary of State John Kerry recently threatened a "Plan B" to increase arms to Syrian rebels if Russia and Assad did not change tactics and stop targeting moderate opposition groups supported by the US and its European and Arab partners.And airstrikes have been taking the toll on war-torn cities like Aleppo -- creating what CNN's Clarissa Ward described as an "apocalyptic wasteland." Hundreds of thousands of civilians were recently caught up in a siege of parts of Aleppo, preventing vital aid supplies from getting through.In response, Moscow announced the creation of a "humanitarian corridor" in the city for three hours a day.Meanwhile, the new commander of US forces in Iraq and Syria, Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, warned Russia and Syria that he will defend US special operations forces in northern Syria if the Assad regime strikes areas where his troops are located. "We've informed the Russians where we're at ... (they) tell us they've informed the Syrians, and I'd just say that we will defend ourselves if we feel threatened," Townsend told CNN's Barbara Starr in a telephone interview Saturday from his Baghdad headquarters.

Story highlightsIn a first, International Criminal Court lists destroying cultural artifacts as a war crime The city of Timbuktu in Mali is a UNESCO World Heritage site founded in fifth centuryIt follows the trial of jihadist Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi, who pleaded guilty Monday to destroying religious monuments in the ancient city of Timbuktu in Mali."I'm willing to accept the judgment of the chamber, but I will do so with pain and a broken heart," Mahdi told the court Monday. Mahdi, also known as "Abou Tourab," was charged in March in the attacks between June and July 2012. He is believed to be a member of the al Qaeda-affiliated Ansar Dine in Mali, which oversaw the ransacking of the city, a UNESCO World Heritage site."Such attacks affect humanity as a whole. We must stand up to the destruction and defacing of our common heritage," prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said in September. "It is also my hope that the years I will spend in prison will be source to purge the evil spirit that took me and I will keep my hopes high that the people will be able to forgive me," Mahdi said at his trial. "I would like to give a piece of advice to the Muslims in the world not to get involved in the kind of acts that I did because it will give no good to humanity."Islamist attacks on historic sitesLike ISIS, which has laid waste to the ancient cities of Nimrud and Palmyra in the Middle East, Ansar Dine declared it would establish an Islamist state and enforce strict Sharia law with little room for cultural or religious tolerance. As a result, the terrorist groups have attacked ancient historic monuments and religious shrines.Timbuktu's treasure troveUsing pickaxes and iron bars, Ansar Dine destroyed tombs of historic religious figures as well as institutions housing documents from the Middle Ages in Timbuktu.Seven mausoleums on the UNESCO World Heritage site were targeted in the attack.Founded in the fifth century, Timbuktu rose to prominence in the 15th and 16th centuries as a center of Islamic learning and helped the spread of Islam across Africa. CNN's Margot Haddad, Sheena McKenzie and Radina Gigova contributed to this report. 
But if a child like Omran were to survive the trip and reach Europe's shores, their ordeal would be far from over.On a visit to the Greek island of Lesvos, I saw first-hand what awaits them. In a detention center on Lesvos I met Ahmed, a one-year-old baby who has been sick for almost all of his short life from what his mother described as a chemical attack. She told me that a bomb destroyed their home soon after Ahmed was born, lodging shrapnel in his neck. Soon after, he developed severe asthma and other symptoms consistent with chlorine gas inhalation. When I met him almost a year after the bombing, I could see his scars and his little body struggled to breathe.His family are Palestinians from Syria, who first fled the horrors of siege and starvation in Yarmouk camp, outside Damascus. But the war followed them as they fled to Idlib in the north of the country. After a bomb hit their home, Ahmed's mother took them across the border into Turkey where they paid smugglers to take them across perilous waters in an overcrowded boat to the Greek islands. Inside Greece's detention centers Once on land, Ahmed's family did not receive a warm welcome. They arrived after the EU-Turkey deal came into effect on March 20 this year, effectively transforming the islands into mass detention facilities.  Ahmed's family were locked up with more than 3,000 other people in Moria detention center, closed off from the outside world by barbed wire fences. When I saw them, they had no privacy and no idea what would happen to them next. Instead of quickly providing Ahmed with the urgent medical care he needed, a doctor first gave the family a box of paracetamol. Journey isn't over yet The family were later removed from detention but remain stranded in Greece, like nearly 60,000 other refugees and migrants. Onward routes to Europe are mostly shut off. If it was up to some European leaders, most would simply be deported back to Turkey. This desperate situation is being played out across Europe -- in Hungary, Serbia, Greece, Calais and elsewhere.Children forget how to readAhmed reminds me of so many children we have seen around the continent, and the ordeals they face. Almost a third of refugees and migrants crossing the Mediterranean to Europe are children. Many of them traveling alone, vulnerable to exploitation, or separated from their families along the way, sometimes by the authorities themselves. Some of the children we've met have spent so long out of school that they have forgotten how to read and write. One 16-year-old boy from Syria who has been in a camp on the Greek mainland told us: "We have been here for 423 days with no hope, no education, no schools. I need the chance to complete my studies." These children need safety, special care, education, and a roof over their head. They need governments to allow and facilitate family reunification. They need countries to follow through on their promises to relocate and resettle families like Ahmed's. EU governments must act In Europe, governments are shamefully behind on both fronts. European Union leaders have relocated a fraction of the refugees they promised to take last September.While Omran, as Aylan Kurdi before him, captured the attention of the world, heartbreak and outrage are not enough. The images have moved the world, but not leaders. Until they act, thousands of children will suffer the same fates as Omran, Aylan and Ahmed.
But to Japanese architect Yasuhiro Yamashita of Atelier Tekuto, there's nothing more beautiful.All starkly different, the only thing these homes have in common is their size -- Yamashita's projects start at just 182 square feet.Demand for small homes in Japan results partly from land scarcity, property prices and taxes, as well as the impending danger posed by the country's regular earthquakes and typhoons.But some residents simply prefer a smaller home, seeking a minimalist lifestyle. "In Japan, there's a saying ('tatte hanjo nete ichijo') that you don't need more than half a tatami mat to stand and a full mat to sleep," says Yamashita. "The idea comes from Zen -- and a belief that we don't need more than the fundamentals."Of course, the beauty of a well-designed micro home is that it doesn't appear 'fundamental' at all. Below, Yamashita divulges 10 strategies to make petite properties feel more spacious.Embrace the awkward"Asymmetrical pieces of land can often be obtained cheaper than others. And it is an architect's job to work with the land and fulfill the client's request," says Yamashita. "'Lucky Drops' -- a house in downtown Tokyo -- is a good example. It was a leftover scrap of land that was less expensive because of its irregular trapezoid shape. We had to be creative, but the result is beautiful. There's a saying in Japanese, that the last drop of wine is considered to be lucky. That's the inspiration."Build towards the sky"When you look at an area in 2D, it might seem very small -- perhaps the plot is just a few meters wide. But thinking in terms of volume, you can build the home higher and create more space. I try to make the house feel like it's extending upwards into the sky, so it's almost like the sky is part of the house. I also build high ceilings, so you don't feel cramped."Incorporate nature"In Japan, about 70% is mountains and forest and 30% of the land is rather flat, making it more suitable for residences and rice farms. Even so, we are not trying to fight against nature -- we're trying to live along with it. You can see this in the homes we design. Most of our homes incorporate natural materials and large windows to let in lots of natural light."Think outside the box"Instead of traditional square corners, I often cut the edges of the house into triangular shapes. This creates more surface area and more room for windows. There's always a corner open to the sky. That way, as the sun moves, the home is always filled with natural light."Go monochrome"What you see informs 60% of your perception of a space. Imagine that you're inside an eggshell, with the same color and texture all over. There's no real start or finish, no real corners. It is a visual effect that will make the space expand. I think that the color white makes spaces look larger, but I prefer to use the natural colors of materials rather than painting."Use reflective materials"To trick the eye, I use polished stainless steel features. They reflect light and make an area seem larger. In 'Reflection of Mineral,' for example, I used stainless steel in the kitchen and in the bathroom to make the space feel more expansive." Hide Storage"People tend to accumulate a lot of things over time. I want it all to be hidden away, out of sight, so I build a lot of invisible storage inside the house. If you keep the area wide open and uncluttered, then it's hard for people to really comprehend the size of the space."Stay close to home"In the 20th century, architecture was meant for the masses, for the general public. Designs and buildings were constructed quickly and economically -- all with the same materials and same appearance. We were in an era of globalization and everyone wanted the same thing. But now, people are looking to their own regions, their own local traditions for inspiration. That's where design is moving -- closer to home."Invent new solutions"I spend a lot of time developing new materials from what other people consider to be 'waste.' I'm like a garbage man. If I find materials that are not commonly used or have been discarded, then I get really excited. If I can't find the materials that go along with the structure, then I invent a new one. For example, I was unhappy with the cement used for homes in Japan, so I worked with Tokyo University to develop a new type. Our recyclable Shirasu Cement is made from volcanic ash deposits."Personalize your home"A few factors affect my designs -- the specificities of the land, the way the light hits the property, the neighborhood, and the client's personal requests. A home is very personal. In 'Reflection of Mineral,' the clients wanted a strong, sharp-looking design. From there, I choose materials based on the design, depending on what would be best for the space."
No, the last part isn't a typo -- Adonis is a tree. The millennium-old Bosnian pine was discovered by a group of scientists from Stockholm University, the University of Mainz and the University of Arizona, who announced their findings Friday. It is one of more than a dozen trees over 1,000 years old located in a forest high in the Pindos mountains near to the Greek border with Albania. The team took a core of its wood, which measured one meter in diameter, and counted the annual rings, determining it is the oldest known living tree in Europe. It still lags a few thousand years behind the world's oldest living tree. That distinction belongs to a bristlecone pine in the White Mountains of California over 5,000 years old.But Adonis would have witnessed its fair share of history, including the Byzantine Empire at its peak as well as the subsequent rise and fall of the Ottoman empire. The tree was 100 years old when Macbeth was crowned King of Scotland and was 750 years old when Isaac Newton formulated his laws of motion. "It is quite remarkable that this large, complex and impressive organism has survived so long in such an inhospitable environment, in a land that has been civilized for over 3,000 years" said dendrochronologist Paul J. Krusic, who led the expedition. The scientists hope to use variations in the rings to glean important historic details about climatic and environmental conditions going back hundreds of years. 
The convicts were executed Sunday at Al-Hoot prison in Nasiriyah, said Yahya Al-Nasiri, governor of Dhiqar province.  The killings have come to be known as the "Speicher Massacre" because it took place at Camp Speicher -- a former US base near Tikrit -- after ISIS forces took control of the area. ISIS released videos after the massacre that showed what seemed to be an endless line of Iraqi military recruits being marched at gunpoint. Later, ISIS posted images showing mass murders.Human Rights Watch described the massacre as the "largest reported incident" where "ISIS captured more than 1,000 soldiers fleeing Camp Speicher ... then summarily executed at least 800 of them."Nasiri was present at the executions. He told CNN that the men were hanged "in the presence of some family members of the Speicher massacre victims, a legal committee, the minister of Justice and other security departments representatives." More executions will follow, Nasiri said.Before Iraqi forces retook the base in 2015, so-called "Speicher families" waited nearly a year to find out what happened to their missing sons, brothers and husbands.Family members gave DNA samples to the Ministry of Health to help authorities identify the bodies.US commander wants to defeat ISIS within a yearIn June, CIA Director John Brennan testified before Congress that ISIS still has about 18,000-22,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria. He said ISIS has lost "large stretches" of territory in both of those countries, has experienced a reduction of finances and has struggled to replenish its ranks as fewer foreign fighters have been traveling to those countries.The top commander of US troops in Iraq and Syria, Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, told CNN from his Baghdad headquarters Saturday that he plans to keep up the pressure on ISIS.He laid out an ambitious military goal: for the US-led coalition to "defeat ISIL in Iraq and Syria in this next year."Related story: US commander warns Syria and RussiaTownsend emphasized he is aware that may be ambitious, but he added, "That's my goal. I am intent to do that."When asked how he would define the defeat of ISIS, the general said it would be when the so-called caliphate no longer exists and does not control significant population centers.CNN's Arwa Damon and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.
But the Rio Games were far from an unqualified success, either. Its legacy is only beginning to form with the Olympic flame now extinguished. And, as with any athletic competition, there are winners and losers on and off the field. Great Britain. The sun had long set on the Empire by 1996, when Team GB collected a desultory 15 medals (with just one gold), good for 36th place in the standings. But thanks to a renewed emphasis on sports -- funded by the country's national lottery -- and buoyed by the success of the 2012 London Games, the British are once again an Olympic superpower.Team GB left Rio with 67 medals -- two more than it earned on home soil four years ago -- and bested China for second place with 27 golds. And its haul came from 19 different sports, most notably Mo Farah's second consecutive double-gold in the 5,000- and 10,000-meter races, six golds in cycling and wins by Andy Murray and Justin Rose in men's tennis and golf, respectively. Britain has displaced Russia and Germany as the top Olympic nation in Europe and seems poised to stay on the top of that perch for a while.Loser: Ryan Lochte. Once best known as Michael Phelps' foil with a bit of an eccentric streak, Lochte had a disappointing Olympics, failing to win an individual medal when he fizzled late in his duel against Phelps in the 200-meter individual medley. Then things really went south for him.Lochte became possibly the biggest Olympics story when his tale of being the victim of a robbery mushroomed into an international incident and a diplomatic embarrassment. With his image now badly tarnished, he squandered potentially millions in endorsement money. Worse yet, his "Ugly American" shenanigans could hurt the US as it bids to host the 2024 Olympics in Los Angeles.Winner:Neymar. If there was one medal all Brazilians craved before the Games, it would surely have been the gold in men's soccer. Two years ago, as the FIFA World Cup host, the Selecao were humiliated in front of their home fans in an epic 7-1 drubbing by eventual champion Germany. Though Olympic soccer is only a glorified under-23 tournament (with three over-age exemptions), Brazil was looking for redemption in its national sport any way it could get it.And it was Neymar -- the Brazilian superstar who missed the Germany debacle in 2014 -- who delivered in front of a delirious crowd at the historic Maracana in the gold medal match against the same German nemesis (forget the fact that none of the German players appeared in the 2014 game). Neymar scored Brazil's lone goal in regulation on a spectacular free-kick, and then finished it off with the winning kick in the penalty shootout. It is inarguable that Neymar is now the most beloved Brazilian since Pele was in his heyday.Winner:Usain Bolt / Michael Phelps. It's hard to mention one without the other, as they both laid legitimate claims to be the greatest Olympian of all time in (most likely) their final Games. Both lived up to the considerable pre-Olympics hype and delivered under the hottest of global spotlights with class and aplomb.Phelps swam in his fifth Olympics and finished with 28 medals overall, including 23 golds, extending his record totals with five golds and a silver in Rio. Bolt retained his title as the World's Fastest Man for the third straight Olympiad, winning triple golds in the 100- and 200-meter races and the 4 x 100 relay just as he did in Beijing 2008 and London 2012. If both truly ended their respective careers in Rio, we may never see the likes of them again.Loser:The people of Rio. While the nightmarish scenarios envisioned before the Games didn't occur, Rio likely did not come off as a future tourist destination for many viewers as other previous Olympics host cities did. What's worse is that once the closing ceremony ended Sunday night, the residents of Rio will be left holding the bag.Because of cost overruns, Rio needed the Brazilian government to provide nearly $1 billion in bailout funds on the eve of the Games. Most of the venues built for the Olympics will have no future uses except as white elephants. The much-publicized new subway line actually will not serve the majority of the city, but one affluent neighborhood. Some estimate that the cost of hosting the Games may top $20 billion, a sum that an almost bankrupt city in a country deep in recession can ill afford.Winner:Golf. In its first Olympics appearance in more than a century, the sport's re-inclusion was highly questioned just before the Games. Many top players used security and health issues to bail out, and there was serious concern that golf could be booted out of the Games again after Tokyo 2020.But as it turned out, Jordan Spieth, Jason Day and Rory McIlroy missed Olympic golf more than the other way around. The Gil Hanse-designed course proved to be a fair test and produced worthy champions. Major winners Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson dueled to the final hole to decide the men's event, while future Hall of Famer Inbee Park romped to the women's gold, holding off World No. 1 Lydia Ko. It didn't hurt that golf's six medals were won by six different countries -- Great Britain, Sweden, United States, South Korea, New Zealand and China, spanning much of the globe.Loser:NBC. Despite the network's crowing about its record online streaming viewership numbers, the stark reality is that its television coverage -- which accounted for an estimated 98% of its audience -- completely flopped. Even though Rio's time-zone proximity (only one hour ahead of the US Eastern Time Zone) made it ideal for the Games to be carried live to the American viewers, NBC stuck to its tired and outdated tape-delayed and packaged coverage during prime time.The result has been massive TV viewer defection, as the Peacock Network saw its ratings plunge, especially among the 18-49 key demographic. All of NBC's prime-time coverage on the West Coast was tape-delayed, including both opening and closing ceremonies, and it's of little surprise that's where the network had its most massive viewer defection.Loser:Olympic Movement. There was no doubt that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) was already under siege before the Rio Games. Few cities wanted to host the Olympics anymore -- only Beijing and Kazakhstan's Almaty ended up bidding on the 2022 Winter Games after Oslo dropped out, citing the staggering cost.Things didn't get better in Rio. There were swaths of empty seats in many venues as interest in the Games seemed generally down. A prominent IOC executive was arrested by Brazilian authorities over allegations of scalping tickets. But the worst blemish might have been the IOC's cowardly decision not to issue a blanket ban on Russia after its rampant doping regime was exposed by the World Anti-Doping Agency. To save his tottering organization, IOC boss Thomas Bach should really consider serious reform instead of paying it mere lip service.
The games in Rio shattered several records and introduced a new generation of Olympic stars like Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky and Fu Yuanhi. Here's a look back at some of those triumphant moments as well as the bizarre ones. The opening ceremony introduced us to Tonga's flag bearer, Pita Taufatofua who made quite the entry with his well-lacquered torso.  In case you missed him in the opening, he made it back for the closing ceremony in shiny fashion. Ticked offMichael Phelps stared down South African rival Chad le Clos, whom he ended up defeating. The steely glare gave birth to meme #Phelpsface. DominantSimone Biles proved unstoppable in Rio. She led her US teammates to a gold for team and took home five medals including the women's individual all-around. Her accomplishments and her fun-filled social media adventures won her tons of accolade. Just green The Olympic diving pool turned a mysterious shade of green, sending puzzled Twitter users into a frenzy. What was going on in that pool?Team GB's diving star Tom Daley wondered, "what happened?"Officials said that algae was to blame, and that there was no need to worry as the water quality "was tested and there were no risks for the athletes." Alrighty then.ExpressiveChinese swimmer Fu Yuanhi, delighted the Internet by pulling a series of funny face to express how happy she was at securing a bronze medal in the women's 100m backstroke.Fu became an overnight sensation in China after her exuberant -- and at times hilarious -- answers in post-competition interviews on state television. She also broke a taboo by talking about her period. PumpedLeslie Jones scored an invite to the Olympics after delighting Twitter with her very quotable commentary. NBC brought the actress and comedian to join their broadcast efforts.Undefeated As Usain Bolt breezed past his competition, he had time to flash a giant, winning smile. Empty Empty seats could be seen at many Olympic venues, most notably at the track and field stadium. Although organizers offered some explanations, the #emptyseats issue persisted throughout the Games. HelpfulWhen New Zealand runner Nikki Hamblin competed in the 5,000 meters race, she stumbled and fell, accidentally tripping Abbey D'Agostino of the US. They helped each other up and the American was later taken away in a wheelchair. But the sportsmanship displayed by the two runners proved memorable. MatureKids who grew up idolizing Michael Phelps ended up becoming their own stars. Katie Ledecky, 19, broke a few records and took home five medals. She got a photo taken with Phelps when she was 10 years old. This time around, it was Phelps getting her autograph. Singapore's Joseph Schooling beat his childhood idol, Phelps, in the 100-meter butterfly, becoming the first Singaporean athlete to win a gold in the Games. Flashback to the time he was just a kid lining up to get Phelps' autograph. ImmatureThe strange saga of Ryan Lochte continued long after he flew back to the US. Two of his teammates were pulled off a plane bound for the United States for further questioning as Brazilian authorities found several inconsistencies in Lochte's story. Later, Lochte attributed his fabrication about a robbery to "immature behavior" and said he was "110% sorry." Social media was not so forgiving. DefiantFeyisa Lilesa of Ethiopia finished the Olympic marathon in second place with his arms crossed over his head, as a sign of solidarity for the Oromo people, his native group and the largest ethnic group in the country. By speaking out, he may not be able to go home.Reviled Another Olympics, another flurry of criticism for NBC. Blasted for being sexist, archaic and reliant on tape delay and packages, viewers tuned out of NBC's primetime coverage of the Olympics. The Olympics are still clearly must-see TV for a wide swath of the United States, but NBC saw weaker ratings as the Olympic winded down. DelightfulBefore we say goodbye to Rio, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wanted to remind you where the next summer games will be. Abe made an epic entry popping out of a Super Mario green pipe dressed as the video game character to tell you to tune in for Tokyo 2020. CNN's Emily Smith and Alison Daye contributed to this report. 
"We knew it was going to be crazy but not this crazy,"  Fiji's rugby sevens captain Captain Osea Kolinisau  told journalists as the country's heroes returned home from Rio Sunday with a Bank Holiday having been declared in their honor for the following day.Thousands lined the streets as Fiji's gold medalists -- the first time the Pacific Islanders had won an Olympic medal of any color -- touched down after their heroics.Fiji's men's team was one of the stories of Rio 2016, living up to its tag as favorite while producing a brand of thrilling rugby which entertained a whole new audience.As the team coach negotiated roads filled with well wishers in Nadi and then capital city Suva, the enormity of the team's achievement became clear.Speaking to CNN before heading home, Kolinisau said the team's victory at the first ever rugby sevens event to be held at the Olympics was something which would stay with him for the rest of his life."The nation is going nuts -- it's crazy," he told CNN."The way we played was the way we wanted to show the world -- for me it's highest achievement personally in rugby and a sporting arena."I never dreamed of being in an Olympics and being an Olympian let alone winning a gold medal. "It's an achievement which will stay with me for the rest of my life. It means a lot to the nation, it's our first medal -- a gold medal"We have been coming to the Olympics since 1956 and hadn't won a medal so to get a medal is unbelievable."Fiji's rugby players arrived in Rio with fans expecting them to win a medal -- and show the kind of rugby which has made them such a joy to watch over the years.After winning the 2015/16 world series, the pressure was on Fiji and it's English coach Ben Ryan, whose success led to him being awarded the Order of Fiji, the highest honorary title that can be awarded under the Order as well as a nice bonus of $14,700.Speaking to CNN before leaving for Rio, Ryan had described the Olympics as his team's "Everest."That they scaled it so easily, particularly in winning the final match 43-7 against Great Britain, was a testament to all involved."We were a good news story for world rugby," Ryan told CNN."We're a small country who hadn't won a medal with small resources and we knocked over the bigger opponents and played in an amazing style."I think we engaged so many people who had not watched rugby before."Free buses were laid on for fans to attend the welcome home ceremony with players being made made officers of the Order of Fiji and rewarded with $14,700 each.Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama told reporters that "the win has inspired people from around the world."
 
Mexico's economy took a turn for the worse at a time when the entire country is closely watching the U.S. elections.  The economy shrank for the first time in three years in the second quarter. Even though Mexico's economy only contracted 0.2% from the previous quarter, any drop is a shock for a country that many experts consider a success in a troubled region.  
  Latin America has hit hard times in recent years. Brazil is in the midst of a historic recession. Argentina has stagnated. And Venezuela is struggling with an extreme economic and humanitarian crisis, where it's citizens don't have enough food.   But Mexico was a bright spot and its economy was growing.   However, the drop in oil prices has slowed the country down because Mexico is a major oil exporter. The oil sector in Mexico has contracted nearly 3% this year compared to a year ago. Its government has had to cut back spending at the state-run oil company, Pemex.   Related: America's NAFTA nemesis: Canada, not Mexico   Compared to Brazil and Venezuela though, Mexico is still standing its ground, experts say.   On an annual basis, Mexico's economy grew 2.5%. That's also well ahead of the United States, which grew about 1% in the first half of the year.   "Mexico will continue to weather low oil prices better than the region's other energy producers," says Edward Glossop, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, a research firm.   Mexico, which relies heavily on trade with the United States, is seeing exports slow down with its northern neighbor as Republican nominee Donald Trump talks tough.   Trump promises to build a wall on the border, potentially slap tariffs on goods from Mexico and pull out of NAFTA, the free trade agreement between Mexico, Canada and the U.S.   Related: Without NAFTA we'd be out of business   Mexican officials have fired back at Trump's intention to make Mexico pay for the wall.   "There is no way Mexico can pay [for] a wall like that," Mexico's president, Enrique Pena Nieto, told CNN's Fareed Zakaria in July.   Trade experts say ending NAFTA would be bad for both nations. It could be especially painful for Mexico, which ships lots of cars, clothes and food to the United States.   Imports from Mexico to the U.S. have declined slightly in the last three quarters after growing for years. Mexico shipped $81 billion worth of goods and services to America at the beginning of this year. That's down a bit from 2015 but well above the figure In the same period in 2010 when it only sent $58 billion.   A Trump tariff on Mexico would likely cause trade between the two countries to shrink dramatically, experts say.   "This would dramatically disrupt trade flows and the jobs that depend on them on both sides of the border." says Eric Farnsworth, vice president at the Council of the Americas.

Spain, Portugal, Italy and other sunny European nations have seen a big boost in tourist numbers this year as nervous travelers avoid places targeted by terrorists.  The head of the World Travel & Tourism Council, David Scowsill, told CNNMoney that the number of tourists arriving in these countries has risen by about 20% to 30% compared to last year.     "People are choosing different destinations based on the perception of security," he said.   Deadly terrorist attacks over the past year or so have forced millions of travelers to nix their dreams of visiting places like the pyramids in Egypt, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Tunisian coast and Istanbul's Hagia Sophia.   Egypt is one of the worst hit places, with tourist arrivals down nearly 50% so far this year, according to United Nations data cited by the WTTC.   France is the world's top destination for international tourists, but its reputation has been hurt badly by a recent spate of terrorist attacks. Spending by travelers in France has been falling for over a year, and forecasts for visitor arrivals have been downgraded by the WTTC.   On the flip side, places like Spain and Italy have been unwitting beneficiaries.   Spain is the third most popular tourist destination in the world, while Italy comes in fifth spot, according to the UN World Tourism Organization.   Sean Tipton, a representative at the Association of British Travel Agents told CNNMoney that Spain is "going to set an all-time record for visitors from all around the world, including the U.K."   Boost for Bulgaria   British travelers are extremely important for the tourism industry in southern Europe and many tour operators have shifted their service away from places like Egypt in favor of European destinations, said Tipton.   But the Brits aren't alone.   "The Germans, the Scandinavians and the Dutch [have done the same] and that's put a massive amount of pressure on hotels and other accommodation," he said.   Related: Unruly France is riskier for businesses than Haiti   Even Bulgaria has gotten a big boost. The country is right next door to Greece and Turkey and has a gorgeous coast along the Black Sea.   "Bulgaria is coming from a low base but it's becoming a big travel and tourism destination," Scowsill told CNNMoney.      CNNMoney (London)  First published August 22, 2016: 9:25 AM ET

WASHINGTON (AP) — With suspicions on both sides mounting, the United States is struggling to preserve its wobbly partnership with Turkey as it entertains a closer relationship with Russia and fumes over a U.S.-based cleric it blames for orchestrating last month's failed coup attempt.


Vice President Joe Biden faces a difficult mission when he travels to Ankara on Wednesday to try to smooth over recent strains: He comes bearing no assurances that the U.S. will agree to Turkey's demand that it extradite that cleric — Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania. Instead, he'll try to convey that the U.S. still needs and values Turkey as a key NATO ally, even amid worrying signs that the U.S. and Turkish approaches to the region's conflicts may be diverging — especially on Syria.


Tensions between the two countries were already bubbling under the surface before the attempted overthrow on July 15, but have since burst into the open. U.S. leaders were incensed when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan alleged the U.S. either supported or was involved in the coup attempt. As the U.S. issued denials, Turkish officials complained loudly that Washington was slow to show support for Turkey's government at its time of greatest need, even though the U.S. expressed support for Erdogan as the coup attempt was underway.


At the same time, the U.S. has been rattled by Turkey's recent diplomatic flirtations with traditional U.S. foes Russia and Iran, concerned they may indicate that a frustrated Turkey is rethinking its allegiance with the West in promoting regional stability. This month Erdogan traveled to Moscow to try to boost ties and possibly even collaboration on ending Syria's civil war, something Moscow has sought unsuccessfully with Washington. And following the Turkish foreign minister's surprise trip to Iran last week, Turkish media reported that Erdogan planned to visit Tehran on Wednesday — the same day he's also slated to meet with Biden.


"Clearly President Erdogan is sending a message by getting closer to Russia and Iran that he's unhappy with the attitude of the West," said Bulent Aliriza, a Turkey analyst at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. "Turkey's still going to remain a NATO member and aspire for EU membership, but the atmosphere is worse than it was on July 14," the day before the coup attempt.


A breakdown of ties to Turkey would be problematic for the U.S., which is counting on Turkey to pursue the same approach to fighting the Islamic State group and addressing extremism across the Middle East. Straddling Europe and Asia, Turkey shares borders with Iraq, Iran and Syria, where the porous border has allowed Islamic State fighters in to Turkey, and would-be recruits into Syria.


But the U.S. and Turkey are unlikely to resolve their dispute over Gulen, who has lived in the U.S. for years in self-imposed exile. Gulen has denied any involvement in the coup attempt, in which more than 270 died, but Turkey's government has insisted the U.S. return him to Turkey immediately.


The Obama administration wants more proof before considering extradition. Although Turkey has submitted extradition requests for Gulen, those requests have been based on previous alleged crimes by Gulen and not evidence of involvement in the coup attempt, senior Obama administration officials said.


The U.S. is sending a Justice Department team to Turkey to help sort out the technical requirements of the request, said the officials, who briefed reporters ahead of Biden's trip on condition of anonymity. They added that Biden planned to tell Turkey's leaders that their public allegations of U.S. complicity won't help their cause.


"People have an expectation that Gulen should be returned to Turkey immediately," said Gulnur Aybet, who teaches international relations at Turkey's Bahcesehir University. "If the extradition request is refused or delayed I'm afraid that's going to have serious repercussions."


The U.S. once looked optimistically at Erdogan as a Muslim leader interested in working with the U.S. and pursuing democratic governance. That optimism has been dampened as Erdogan has cracked down on press and other freedoms and his government has put a premium on opposing outlawed Kurdish rebels — sometimes at the expense, in the Obama administration's view — of focusing on IS.


Washington's concerns about human rights and democracy in Turkey intensified after the failed coup, which led the government to detain or fire tens of thousands of police, soldiers, teachers and journalists. Yet the U.S. has been careful not to hammer Turkey over those concerns in public out of concern it would undercut the U.S. message of support for Turkey's government.


The fragile situation in Turkey was compounded over the weekend when a suicide bomber killed at least 54 people at a Kurdish wedding celebration in Gaziantep, near the Syria border. It was the deadliest attack this year in Turkey, joining other deadly attacks by IS or by the Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the PKK.


In another worrying sign for the U.S., Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim appeared to warm to the possibility of Syrian President Bashar Assad maintaining a role in a transitional government. Turkey and the U.S. have both called for Assad's ouster for years, insisting he can't be part of Syria's future government.


This story has been corrected in the 5th paragraph to say the day 'before' the coup attempt, not the day 'of' the coup attempt.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The disclosure that some pills found at Prince's Paisley Park home and studio were counterfeit and contained the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl strongly suggests they came to the superstar illegally.


Exactly how Prince obtained the drugs is still unknown.


Prince died April 21 of an accidental fentanyl overdose.


An official close to the investigation told The Associated Press Sunday that some pills were falsely labeled as a common generic painkiller similar to Vicodin, but actually contained fentanyl. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation.


Minnesota defense attorney Joe Tamburino isn't connected to the case, but says the pills were likely obtained illegally. Tamburino said investigators probably will talk to Prince's closest associates and search computers and phones to track how Prince got the drugs.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — "Star Wars" actor Mark Hamill is among those lending his support to a terminally ill fan who wants to see "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" before he dies.


Hamill backed a social media campaign launched last week by hospice worker Amy Duncan asking for the "Star Wars" spin-off to be screened for illustrator Neil Hanvey from Oldham, England.


Duncan says the 36-year-old cancer patient was informed by doctors in April that he has six to eight months to live. "Rogue One" is set for release Dec. 16.


The film stars Felicity Jones and is set between the third and fourth "Star Wars" installments.


"Star Wars: The Force Awakens" was screened for terminally ill fan Daniel Fleetwood on Nov. 5. He died days after seeing the movie.

Donald Trump has reportedly postponed a planned speech on immigration this week amid questions over whether he no longer stands by one of the core proposals of his candidacy.


The Republican nominee was due in Colorado to deliver a speech in Denver on Thursday as part of a weeklong focus on immigration as well as to attend a $25,000-per-couple fundraiser in Aspen the same day.


Lydia Blaha, a spokeswoman for the campaign in Colorado, confirmed Monday to The Denver Post that the event would not take place as scheduled, and the campaign emailed supporters explaining that "the speech he was planning to give is still being modified."


He also reportedly cancelled a rally scheduled for Friday in Las Vegas. 




Confirmed: @alivitali reports that Trump's planned Denver immigration speech is now postponed. Will not be this week. No reason given.— Mark Murray (@mmurraypolitics) August 22, 2016




The cancellations come as the Trump campaign pushes back on reports he was "flip-flopping" on his plan to deport the more than 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Trump first announced his support of mass deportation last August, and along with his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border it became the centerpiece of his campaign and a major source of his support.


At a meeting with Hispanic leaders over the weekend, Trump reportedly suggested his plan for a deportation force was potentially up for reconsideration, raising their hopes he planned to find a solution "that respects border security but deals with this in a humane and efficient manner," immigration lawyer Jacob Monty told Buzzfeed News after the Saturday meeting. And Univision reported the planned Thursday speech would introduce a new immigration proposal that would include a path to legalization for immigrants without proper documentation. 


Newly installed campaign manager Kellyanne Conway on Sunday suggested some wiggle room in Trump's plan, saying it was "to be determined" if he would still support the creation of a "deportation force."


"What he supports is to make sure that we enforce the law, that we are respectful of those Americans who are looking for well-paying jobs, and that we are fair and humane for those who live among us in this country," Conway said.


Conway's comments set off a firestorm of speculation that Trump was shifting to a more general election-friendly message. But on Monday, Trump insisted he had no intention of changing his stance.


"I'm not flip-flopping," Trump told Fox News. "We want to come up with a really fair but firm answer."


But as the campaign confirmed the postponement of Thursday's event, other campaign representatives who attended Saturday's meeting were less clear.


Helen Aguirre Ferre, the Republican National Committee's director of Hispanic communications, on Monday afternoon declined to answer whether Trump was changing his tune.

"He never said the word 'deportation' and he never said the word 'legalization,'" Ferre told MSNBC on Monday. "He was there to listen and learn. He didn't give any indication one way or another as to what he would be doing."


"They're working on their policy at this point in time, it has to be very strong and very firm, and has to be fair or humane," she added.


And on Monday, Conway said the plan to deport 11 million people was never set in stone.


"Even Sen. Jeff Sessions [R-Ala.], who was one of the first to endorse Donald Trump and is known for the immigration issue, he doesn't deport 11 million people in his plan," Conway said on CNBC on Monday. "In other words, what Donald Trump says is we need a fair and effective way to deal with the 11 million here who are here who live among us, at the same time protecting American jobs and American workers and also securing our borders obviously. But what he's saying is immigration is a very complex issue with a very complex solution."


But even as Trump has evolved on his other headline immigration plan – at first calling for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S. to now saying he supports barring travel from terrorism-stricken countries – he has remained consistent about his support for mass deportation since last August.

CHINA CAMP STATE PARK, Calif. (AP) — The last remaining resident of a shrimping village established by Chinese immigrants on the northern shore of San Francisco Bay has died.


The Marin Independent Journal reports (http://bayareane.ws/2bqCCsV) Frank Quan died of natural causes on August 15. He would have been 91 this week.


Quan was born in and lived most of his life in China Camp Village, which once thrived near San Rafael in Marin County in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.


He played a key role in transforming China Camp into a state park in the 1970s after a developer donated the 36-acre village to be preserved as a living memorial to the Bay Area's Chinese-American history.


Until his death, he fished in the waters, maintained historic buildings and equipment and ran a small diner his family had operated for generations. Most of his catch was sold as bait, but on weekends he would cook and serve clam chowder to park visitors.


"Frank was such a rare character, really the true living history of China Camp," said John Muir, a longtime friend and board member of Friends of China Camp. "When you visit the village, it feels like you have stepped back in time, and a lot of that feeling is there thanks to Frank."


At its height in the 1880s, the village was home to 500 Chinese people, many of whom moved from cities to the remote camp to escape anti-Chinese sentiments sweeping across California. They made their living catching shrimp on San Pablo Bay before drying, sorting and shipping them back to their ancestral homeland. The village's economy suffered a severe blow in the early 1900s when the export of shrimp was outlawed and the use of bag nets, then the most efficient way of catching shrimp, was prohibited.


Quan said shrimp in the bay were depleted in the 1960s when river water that normally would have poured into the bay was diverted, making the bay too salty for shrimp to thrive.


"We used to pull out 3 million pounds of shrimp a year around here. One boat could bring in two tons a day," Quan told The Associated Press in a 2011 interview. "It's hard to see this all go to hell in a lifetime."


A public memorial and celebration of Quan's life is being planned.

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Storm victims spill out of the waiting rooms, some clutching water-stained documents, others with the long stare of those stricken by disaster, each with a story of personal tragedy about the Louisiana flood's devastation to their homes and their lives.


The line for the makeshift Federal Emergency Management Agency recovery center started to gather before the facility opened Monday at a substance abuse treatment site run by a local Baptist church. The stream of traffic has been steady ever since.


Edward Shaw, 62, has been staying at a local Motel 6 since last week's flooding inundated the house he was renting, the water rising to the top of the front door. He lost his furniture and his car, and hasn't heard from his landlord about when the house might be repaired.


FEMA started covering his motel costs Sunday, though he's not sure for how long.


"I hope to God FEMA give me enough so I can start all over again," Shaw said.


And if that doesn't happen? "You just keep on praying," he said.


The long, hard slog of recovery is underway across south Louisiana, after a storm that began Aug. 12 dumped as much as 2 feet of rain in some areas over 48 hours, causing catastrophic flooding.


At least 13 deaths have been attributed to the flooding, and more than 60,000 homes were damaged by the storm, which has been described as the worst disaster since Superstorm Sandy in 2012.


President Barack Obama planned to visit the area Tuesday.


In hard-hit neighborhoods, people spent their weekend gutting homes in brutal heat, ripping out water-logged carpet and flooring, stripping out walls and insulation and sifting through personal belongings to determine if anything was salvageable. Piles of water-damaged furniture, clothes, photographs and toys filled curbs, as shell-shocked residents discarded nearly everything they owned.


At least $110 million in agriculture was damaged by the storm, a figure likely to grow, according to the an estimate released Monday by the LSU AgCenter.


In Ascension Parish, residents in some areas were still dealing with high water. Officials said they are waiting for water levels to drop so they can make a cut in the levee that would allow the water to drain. About 19,000 homes had water in them — about 40 percent of the parish's total housing stock.


The risk of further flooding has finally lessened, and the focus has shifted fully to recovery.


Disaster food stamp aid was being distributed in eight parishes, and the number of people staying in shelters had dwindled to about 2,800. Schools in some damaged parishes begin reopening this week. Debris removal started this weekend in heavily-damaged Baton Rouge neighborhoods.


Flood insurance adjusters were on the ground, assessing property damage.


Roy Wright, FEMA's deputy associate administrator for insurance, said more than 25,000 claims already have been filed with the National Flood Insurance Program and $15 million in advance payments had been distributed to homeowners to help people begin repairs.


"We want to make sure they have the resources they need immediately to muck out their homes, even as we go through the rest of the adjustment process," Wright said.


Large numbers of flood-damaged homes weren't covered with flood insurance.


Ariana Galindo, a Spanish teacher from Baton Rouge, is one of the many residents who didn't live in a designated flood zone that required flood insurance coverage, so she never bought it. Galindo's home was hit with 2 feet of water, and she and her husband were staying temporarily at her aunt's house.


"I lost everything, and I just called my homeowners' insurance and they told me that they don't cover anything because the insurance that I'm paying for doesn't cover flood," Galindo said Monday, waiting with dozens of others in the FEMA assistance center. "I need some help to repair my house."


Five such recovery centers had opened so far — and more were planned — operating seven days a week. About 110,000 people across south Louisiana already had registered for federal disaster assistance, most signing up online.


FEMA aid, however, isn't expected to be enough.


"This is really the first step in your recovery process. We can't get you back to where you were before the storm, but we can help you get to a safe, secure and sanitary environment," said FEMA spokeswoman Renee Bafalis.


Burnell Williams Sr. and his wife, Lois, lost their entire house in St. Bernard Parish to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. After that monster storm, they moved to Baton Rouge — and that home was hit with 4 feet of water in last week's flooding.


"We lost everything in the house," Burnell Williams said. "This is the second time for us."

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the U.S. presidential campaign. (all times EDT):


Donald Trump is postponing a speech in which he was to lay out his immigration policy.


The Republican presidential nominee had been slated to unveil the proposal Thursday in Denver. A campaign official not authorized to publicly discuss Trump's plans said it was being postponed, likely until next week, but did not say why.


Trump promised in an interview Monday that he would deliver a "fair but firm" policy toward the 11 million immigrants living in the United States illegally.


That has raised questions about whether Trump is backtracking from previous pledges to push for mass deportations.


Trump has insisted he is not "flip-flopping" But he told immigration activists he may consider allowing those who have not committed crimes, beyond their immigration offenses, to obtain some sort of legal status.


Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence is doubling down on running mate Donald Trump's call for Hillary Clinton to shut down her family's long-time charitable foundation.


Pence said Monday at a manufacturing facility in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, that Clinton must close the Clinton Foundation immediately. Trump issued the same call earlier in the day through social media.


Clinton's campaign announced recently the foundation will stop accepting foreign donations if she is elected president. Pence says that pledge isn't enough and the Democratic presidential nominee needs to "come clean" about the foundation.


The Indiana governor has made several stops in Iowa since securing the GOP vice presidential nomination. They include speeches in Sioux City and Council Bluffs and a stop at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines.


Donald Trump is suggesting he would resume the practice of giving surplus military equipment to local police departments.


The Obama administration banned police agencies from receiving military-grade equipment after 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the death of Michael Brown, a black man, in a confrontation with police.


Answering a question Monday in Akron, Ohio, Trump said, "I think it's ridiculous that they're not" given the equipment.


The Republican presidential nominee also said he believed that some rising crime is partly due to a decline in police manpower and vowed to change that.


Trump met with two dozen active and retired police officers at Lodge 7 of the Fraternal Order of Police. The union's national organization is expected to announce an endorsement next month.


Is a 12-year-old really running Republican Donald Trump's presidential campaign in Jefferson County, Colorado?


Broadcast reports describe Weston Imer (EYE'-mer) as running the field operation in the state's fourth most populous county. The boy's mother, Laurel Imer, is technically in charge but says she's ceded responsibility to her son until school starts.


Trump's Colorado co-chair, Robert Blaha, says while the campaign likes to have Weston speak at rallies and knock on doors, he's not the campaign office boss.


Says Blaha in an interview: "There's not the possibility a 12-year-old can run an office."


Colorado is traditionally a swing state, but polls show Democrat Hillary Clinton opening a lead over Trump. Clinton and her allies have stopped advertising in Colorado and shifted money to more competitive states.


Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine says GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump owes it to the public to release more details about his income and debts.


Kaine says Trump should release his tax returns and provide more information about his companies' debts, particularly those held by foreign banks.


Kaine says, "We've got to know who Donald Trump is beholden to."


Kaine spoke Monday in Las Vegas at the ironworkers' union annual convention.


He is also criticizing Trump's resistance to efforts by employees to unionize at his hotel off the Las Vegas strip.


Kaine is also attacking Trump's policies on immigration. He says conflicting statements the Republican's campaign has issued on the subject show Trump can't be trusted.


Former President Bill Clinton is defending the work of his charitable foundation, saying it has "improved millions of lives around the world."


The former president is listing the accomplishments of the Clinton Foundation in an email to supporters. He says more than 11.5 million people in over 70 countries have access to HIV/AIDS drugs at a much lower cost and millions of American students have healthier food because of the foundation.


Bill Clinton said last week the foundation won't accept contributions from foreign governments and corporations if Democrat Hillary Clinton is elected president.


Republican Donald Trump says the foundation should be shut down immediately.


Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid has launched an online petition demanding that Donald Trump take the U.S. citizenship test.


The Nevada Democrat is an outspoken Trump antagonist. He argues that Trump would likely fail the citizenship test and that he should be forced to prove otherwise before setting rules for new immigrants to the country. Trump has called for "extreme vetting" of immigrants seeking admission to the United States.


"Donald Trump is nothing more than a spoiled, unpatriotic drain on society who has earned nothing and helped no one," Reid says in an email sent from his fundraising committee. "And before he degrades immigrant families who work hard and give up everything they knew to come to this country, he should put up — or shut up."


Hillary Clinton says she will visit flood-damaged Louisiana when "the presence of a political campaign will not disrupt the response."


In a statement Monday, the Democratic presidential nominee called the floods a crisis in need of a national response. She noted that she had asked supporters to contribute to the Red Cross to help recovery efforts for the more than 100,000 people affected by the floods.


Clinton added that she wants to make sure there is a focus on Zika prevention, so that the mosquitoes that carry the virus don't spread to Louisiana.


Republican nominee Donald Trump visited Louisiana Friday and President Barack Obama is expected Tuesday. Heavy flooding this month killed at least 13 people and displaced thousands more after water engulfed their homes.


Donald Trump is resuming his Twitter wars.


The Republican nominee is going after MSNBC's Morning Joe, tweeting that the show is "unwatchable!"


He says its host, Mika Brzezinski, "is off the wall, a neurotic and not very bright mess!"


Trump's tweets come after he spent a rare week reading from teleprompters and sticking to message following a campaign shake-up.


Trump's new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, insisted on Sunday that Trump "doesn't hurl personal insults."


Trump also suggested that he has damaging information on Brzezinski and co-host Joe Scarborough, whom he called "two clowns." Trump has targeted other people in similar style, claiming he has damaging information without ever releasing it.


Donald Trump says he is not flip-flopping on a plan to deport the 11 million people living in the United States illegally.


The Republican presidential candidate said Monday he wants to come up with a "fair but firm answer" on immigration.


He told "Fox and Friends" that he is working with Hispanic leaders to address illegal immigration. He said: "It has to be very firm, but we want to come up with something fair.'


Trump met over the weekend with Hispanic supporters, representatives of a community that has been wary of the billionaire businessman's proposals to build a border wall and deport people living in the United States illegally. Trump's new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, Sunday that Trump's policy on deploying a "deportation force" was "to be determined."


Donald Trump is calling on the Clintons to shut down their charitable foundation "immediately."


Trump says in a statement Monday morning that "the Clinton Foundation is the most corrupt enterprise in political history."


He says, "It must be shut down immediately."


The foundation announced recently that it would not accept donations from foreign contributors if Hillary Clinton were elected president.


The Clinton campaign has defended the foundation's work, insisting it is saving lives around the globe through vaccine work.


Trump donated to the foundation himself in the past.


Donald Trump's son says his father isn't flip-flopping on immigration policy.


The Republican presidential candidate plans to speak about his immigration plans this week. That has raised questions about whether he will continue to call for forcibly deporting the 11 million people living in the United States illegally. Questioned on whether Trump still intends to deploy a "deportation force" to carry that out, his campaign manager said Sunday: "To be determined."


Eric Trump, one of Trump's sons, was asked on "Fox and Friends" Monday whether this was a flip-flop. He replied: "My father hasn't flip-flopped on anything."


He declined to provide details of his father's plans, but said they will be "humane and ethical and treats everybody well, but we have to solve a problem," referring to illegal immigration.


Hillary Clinton's campaign is reserving an additional $80 million for fall campaign ads in eight battleground states. That brings the campaign's spending on television spots to $150 million, according to a campaign aide.


Clinton's team is also releasing a new ad that questions the judgment of GOP rival Donald Trump.


"All it takes is one wrong move," says a narrator, over the sound of a flying missile.


The ad is running in Florida, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada, Ohio, North Carolina and Omaha, Neb. Clinton has paused ads in Colorado and Virginia, underscoring her confidence in those states.


Trump only began airing ads in recent days and has reserved just $5 million in battleground state spots over the coming week in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania.


Secretary of State Colin Powell is pushing back against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's assertion that he suggested she use her private email account for non-classified information.


People magazine reported in a Twitter message that Powell said that Clinton's "people have been trying to pin" her email scandal on him.


Clinton has said that she and Powell were in agreement on the use of private email by secretaries of state. Clinton, though, had a private email server at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y.


Questions about Clinton's handling of government email have dogged her throughout her presidential campaign. The Justice Department investigated her practices and concluded there was no basis to recommend charges be brought against her, although FBI Director James Comey called her handling of the emails "extremely careless."


GOP officials insist presidential nominee Donald Trump is finally hitting his stride and will catch up with Democrat Hillary Clinton by around Labor Day.


Clinton campaign officials dismissed the idea of a changed Trump as nonsense.


Republican Party chairman Reince Priebus (ryns PREE'-bus) said Sunday that "Donald Trump has been disciplined and mature. And I think he's going to get this thing back on track."


Polls now mostly show Trump lagging Clinton by 5 percentage points or more nationally, but Priebus predicted they will tighten up and Trump will be "ahead as we move through September."


Trump's new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, echoed Priebus' optimism, contending that the candidate just had the best week of his campaign, "mostly because he's able to be himself, the authentic Donald Trump."

CINCINNATI (AP) — Adrian Gonzalez got the most pleasure out of watching his teammates circle the bases. Nobody made as many trips as he did.


Gonzalez hit three of the Dodgers' seven homers — driving in a career-high eight runs — and rookie Corey Seager had a noteworthy homer as well on Monday, leading Los Angeles to an 18-9 victory and a split of its four-game series with the Cincinnati Reds.


The NL West leaders enjoyed their biggest home run splurge in 10 years. They've won 10 of their last 12 games against Cincinnati.


Four of Gonzalez's teammates also homered in the Dodgers' biggest power performance since they hit seven during an 11-10 win over San Diego on Sept. 18, 2006.


Gonzalez started it with a three-run shot in the first inning off Homer Bailey (2-2), who had his worst showing since returning from Tommy John surgery. Gonzalez also had a solo shot in the fifth, when the Dodgers connected four times overall.


His three-run shot in the seventh tied his career high for homers. He drove in another run with a groundout as the Dodgers scored 18 runs for the first time in 10 years.


The first baseman attributed it to Great American Ball Park's dimensions.


"It's tiny and the ball flies," Gonzalez said. "Right field is short. I hit two fly balls that went out. I could have been 1 for 6 with a homer."


Dodgers manager Dave Roberts played left field for the Padres in that game 10 years ago when Los Angeles also hit seven.


"It feels much better from this side," Roberts said. "Yeah, I saw 'em. I remember."


The Dodgers needed the big game offensively. Left-hander Scott Kazmir lasted a season-low 2 2/3 innings, giving up six hits and four runs. Joey Votto singled home a run off reliever Jesse Chavez (1-0), one of his four RBIs.


Kazmir said he's been bothered lately by a stiff right side of his neck. He doesn't want to go on the disabled list. He'll be examined in Los Angeles.


"I'm pretty stubborn," Kazmir said. "I can feel like this and get it done. But when you're putting up numbers like that, it's tough to swallow."


There were homer notes galore:


— Seager's two-run shot gave him 22 homers, trying Glenn Wright's club record for a shortstop from 1930. He tied his career high with four hits and extended his hitting streak to 13 games.


— The seven homers allowed by Reds pitchers tied the club record.


— Andrew Toles and Rob Segedin hit their first career homers back-to-back in the fifth, becoming the first Dodger duo to accomplish that one.


— The last time the Dodgers hit four homers in an inning was Sept. 28, 2006, against San Diego.


Bailey gave up a season-high six runs and nine hits, leaving after 59 pitches. Chase Utley singled on Bailey's first pitch of the game, and Seager singled on the second pitch. Gonzalez homered on the first pitch, leaving him 11 for 25 career against the right-hander with six homers. The homer extended his hitting streak to a season-high 15 games.


"We're seeing what we expected to see," Reds manager Bryan Price said of Bailey, who has made five starts. "Some days, he's electric and sharp. Some days, there's fatigue and achiness and you're not going to have your grade-A stuff."


Bud Norris, who started on Friday and lasted 3 2/3 innings, pitched the eighth to help LA's depleted bullpen. He threw 18 pitches, retired two batters, gave up two hits and a walk, and felt some tightness in his back. Reds outfielder Tyler Holt pitched the ninth and retired the three batters he faced.


It was Gonzalez's 21st career multi-homer game. He's the third Dodger to hit three in a game this season, joining Yasmani Grandal and Seager. ... It was the Dodgers' biggest game offensively since a 19-11 win at Colorado in 2006. ... The Reds also gave up seven homers at Colorado on May 31.


Dodgers: RF Josh Reddick was scratched from the lineup because of a jammed middle finger on his right hand that bothered his throwing. He pinch hit and flied out.


Reds: SS Zack Cozart missed a fifth straight game with a sore left Achilles tendon. Price said he'll miss at least one more game.


Dodgers: Ken Maeda (12-7) opens a home series against the Giants. He has won his last four decisions — in five starts — with a 3.45 ERA.


Reds: Dan Straily (9-6) starts the opener of a two-game series against Texas at Great American Ball Park. He's 3-3 career against the Rangers in 10 games.

Global travel spending is still growing, although at a slower pace, despite weakening economies and fears over terrorism, according to a report Monday, Aug. 22, 2016, by the World Travel and Tourism Council.

By SCOTT MAYEROWITZ, AP Business Writer


NEW YORK (AP) — Global travel spending is still growing, although at a slower pace, despite weakening economies and fears over terrorism.


The World Travel and Tourism Council, a group backed by travel providers with the mission to promote tourism, said in a report Monday that global travel spending for 2016 is expected to grow by 3.1 percent. That is down from a March forecast of 3.3 percent but still outpacing global economic growth, which the group expects to be 2.3 percent.


Macroeconomic problems have a much bigger impact on travel than terrorist attacks, the group's president, David Scowsill, said.


"Travelers aren't going to allow isolated terrorist attacks to put them off traveling," he said. Tourists worried about safety in France have chosen Spain or Italy instead, for example.


Scowsill said destinations with tourist-specific attacks usually take two years to recover, while other types of attacks lead to a faster resumption of travel.


Other travel groups are also seeing the slowdown in travel spending.


The International Air Transport Association recently noted that while more people are flying, the upward trend "has moderated since January" and the percent of seats occupied has actually slipped slightly.


"The fragile and uncertain economic backdrop, political shocks and a wave of terrorist attacks are all contributing to a softer demand environment," said the group's head, Tony Tyler, in a statement.


And back in April, the Global Business Travel Association warned of slowing volume from U.S.- originating business travelers.


Of course, not each part of the world is facing the same growth or problems. The World Travel and Tourism Council breaks down expected 2016 travel spending this way:


— South Asia leads growth at 5.9 percent, driven by strong economic prospects in India.


— Latin America is expected to be the worst performer, with an anticipated decline of 0.9 percent, driven by weakness in Brazil.


— Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia are seen growing at 4.7 percent and 4 percent respectively, stimulated by China growing at 6.3 percent.


— North America matches the global growth rate of 3.1 percent.


— Europe is expected to face challenges and only grow by 2.2 percent.


It's a different story in the United Kingdom, which recently voted to leave the European Union. Growth there is actually expected to exceed the rest of Europe at 3.6 percent. The travel group expects weaker domestic spending and a 3 percent drop in outbound U.K. trips. However, it expects all of that to be offset by higher spending in the U.K. by international visitors benefiting from greater spending power as a result of the weaker British pound.

 This undated photo provided by Scholastic Inc., shows Oscar-nominated filmmaker Morton Schindel. Schindel developed a technique to transform illustrations from children's books into moving images and produced more than 300 movies and 450 recordings. He died Saturday, Aug. 20, 2016, at age 98. (Chichi Ubina/Scholastic Inc. via AP)  The Associated Press 


WESTON, Conn. (AP) — An Oscar-nominated filmmaker who developed a technique to transform illustrations from children's books into moving images for films has died at his Connecticut home. Morton Schindel was 98.


Scholastic Inc. senior vice president Kyle Good says Schindel died of natural causes Saturday in Weston. Scholastic bought Schindel's company, Weston Woods Studios, in 1996.


Schindel's filmmaking technique involved using cameras to make original artwork from books move across the screen. It was used in the 1973 film "Where the Wild Things Are," based on Maurice Sendak's children's book of the same name.


The Orange, New Jersey, native and former New York resident produced more than 300 movies and 450 recordings.


In 1986, he received an Academy Award nomination for "Doctor De Soto," based on the children's book by William Steig.


This story has been corrected to show the "Where the Wild Things Are" film that used Schindel's technique was released in 1973, not 2009.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google is ready to start sending out the latest version of its Android operating system to a handful of devices.


The release announced Monday means many Nexus-branded devices should receive a free upgrade to Android 7.0, nicknamed "Nougat," during the next few weeks.


The first models in line include the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C and General Mobile 4G.


Other smartphones coming out this fall will be sold with Nougat already installed.


The new version of Android has been in a testing phase since March as Google polished the system that will feature 72 new emojis and the ability to reply to notifications without opening an app.


Rival Apple is scheduled to release the latest operating system for the iPhone next month.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Expressing "deep regret" for his actions, an Islamic extremist pleaded guilty Monday to orchestrating the destruction of historic mausoleums in the Malian desert city of Timbuktu.


Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi, wearing a dark suit and striped tie, stood and calmly told judges he was entering the guilty plea "with deep regret and great pain" and advised Muslims around the world not to commit similar acts, saying "they are not going to lead to any good for humanity."


The guilty plea was a landmark for the court, which has struggled to bring suspects to justice since its establishment in 2002. It was the first guilty plea and the first time prosecutors have launched a trial for the crime of deliberately attacking buildings of religious or cultural significance.


"Our cultural heritage is not a luxury good," Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda told the three-judge panel. She said Al Mahdi's guilty plea "will set a clear precedent, sending an important and positive message to the entire world."


She compared the case to the destruction last year of historic ruins in the Syrian city of Palmyra by Islamic State extremists.


The court can't bring charges in that case because Syria is not a member of the court and the U.N. Security Council hasn't called for an ICC investigation, court spokesman Fadi El Abdallah said.


Al Mahdi led a group of radicals that destroyed 14 of Timbuktu's 16 mausoleums in 2012 because they considered them totems of idolatry. The one-room structures that house the tombs of the city's great thinkers were on the World Heritage list.


Al Mahdi faces a maximum sentence of 30 years imprisonment, but prosecutors say they will seek a sentence of nine to 11 years. Judges will issue a verdict and pass sentence at a later hearing.


Prosecutors showed judges photos and videos of rebels wielding pick axes, sticks and axes to attack a mosque's door and small, brick-built mausoleums in the city. Among them were images of Al Mahdi, at times with a Kalashnikov rifle slung over his shoulder, directing the attacks, which reduced the historic structures to piles of rubble.


Prosecutors say Al Mahdi was a member of Ansar Dine, an Islamic extremist group with links to al-Qaida that held power in northern Mali in 2012. The militants were driven out after nearly a year by French forces, which arrested Al Mahdi in 2014 in neighboring Niger.


U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commended the court for bringing the case against Al Mahdi, saying it "draws our attention to an increasingly worrying trend of deliberate destruction of cultural heritage in situations of armed conflict," according to a statement released by his spokesman.


Human rights activists have also welcomed the case, but criticized prosecutors for failing to file more charges against Al Mahdi.


The International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) said its member organizations have documented a litany of crimes and filed a criminal complaint on behalf of 33 victims in Malian courts accusing Al Mahdi and 14 others of crimes including rape and sexual slavery.


"We ... deeply regret that the charges against Al Mahdi were not widened to include crimes against the civilian population, including sexual and gender-based crimes, whose victims are far too often ignored during accountability processes," FIDH member organizations said in a statement ahead of the trial.


Speaking after Monday's hearing, Bensouda said further charges could follow in her Mali probe.


"We are also investigating other crimes," she said. "So this is the first case we've brought and we will see with respect to other crimes that have been committed within the context in Mali."


On the eve of the hearing, Timbuktu's mayor, Halle Ousmane, welcomed the prosecution.


"Justice has been done," Ousmane said. "We thank almighty God and all our partners, all those who have helped with his arrest so that today justice can be done."


Baba Ahmed in Timbuktu contributed to this report.

LONG POND, Pa. (AP) — Will Power chalked up his latest milestone to experience. There's nothing like it with a championship on the line.


Power continued his stirring late-season run on Monday, holding pole-sitter Mikhail Aleshin at bay after a final restart, and won the rain-delayed IndyCar race at Pocono Raceway.


It was the fourth win in six races for Power, the 29th of his career, and cut 38 points off the lead in the standings held by Team Penske teammate Simon Pagenaud. Pagenaud finished 18th after a late crash and Power trails by 20 with three races remaining in the season.


"It feels normal. It's not like I'm doing anything special. That's the funny thing," said Power, who missed the first race of the season with concussion symptoms and watched Pagenaud mount a commanding lead in the points with a similar early season surge. "I'm very seasoned on how races play out, when to take risks and when not to. That's how I've been doing it. Now, I'm feeling good."


Power's surge has moved him into a tie in all-time wins with Rick Mears and Scott Dixon, and also includes second-place finishes at Iowa and Mid-Ohio.


On this day, unlike his early years, the 35-year-old Australian was methodical, slowly working his way forward as the crew made change after change in the pits. He led 55 of 200 laps.


"It's another example of just hanging out all day, adjusting on the car and getting the car right, and then booming at the end," said Power, who started eighth. "The older you get, the more you let the race happen."


Defending race winner Ryan Hunter-Reay finished third, Josef Newgarden was fourth and Sebastien Bourdais fifth thanks to late-race pit strategy.


A year ago, Hunter-Reay won a crash-filled race at Pocono that took the life of 37-year-old Englishman Justin Wilson. Pocono Raceway painted "JW" on the track at the finish line and Union Jacks flew at half-staff in his honor. Both Wilson and open-wheel driver Bryan Clauson, who was killed two weeks ago in a crash in Kansas, were remembered in the pre-race prayer and with a moment of silence.


Hunter-Reay and Aleshin took turns in the lead for the first two-thirds of the race. The complexion of the race and the points race changed after Pagenaud crashed to bring out a caution.


Hunter-Reay took the lead on the restart, and after zooming through the first turn began to slow with electrical problems and fell a lap down.


Power then regained the lead, and after a debris caution on lap 176, he exited the pits in first place as Hunter-Reay got back on the lead lap with one last chance. He ran out of laps after weaving his way back to third.


Aleshin tried to challenge one final time, but Power pulled away over the final 20 laps.


Other things to know about the IndyCar race at Pocono on Monday:


ALESHIN SHINES: Aleshin was fastest in first practice on Saturday, fastest with the pole on the line and very fast on Monday. Just not quite fast enough.


Still, that his career-best IndyCar finish came on an oval served notice that his No. 7 Schmidt Peterson Motorsports Honda is becoming a force to be reckoned with.


"It could be greater if I could be standing on the top of the podium," said Aleshin, who led a race-high 87 laps and has led 130 circuits the last two races. "I just wanted this win so bad."


HUNTER-REAY'S BAD LUCK: Hunter-Reay, who started last because of a crash in practice that prevented him from qualifying, was poised to win at Pocono for the second straight year and get the chance to celebrate that he didn't last year because of the crash that killed Wilson.


Leading on a late restart, his engine stalled going into the first turn with an electrical problem, and before he could refire, the engine fell a lap down. A debris caution allowed him to regain the lost lap and he surged to a podium finish.


"I had the car under me to do it," Hunter-Reay said. "Leading the race and the engine shuts off. What more could happen? Just have to smile and keep pushing. It's been that way. This one's going to be a hard one to put behind me."


PAGENAUD PLUMMETS: Pagenaud hit the wall on lap 158 after his No. 22 Chevy bottomed out. He lost the steering, hit the wall hard and was still puzzled after exiting the care center.


ROSSI RUINED: Indy 500 winner Alexander Rossi was in the top five early in the race, but the rookie's promising day was spoiled by a scary crash on pit road nearly a third of the way through the race. He exited his pit and was clipped by Charlie Kimball, which sent Rossi's No. 98 Honda over the top of the No. 3 Penske Chevrolet driven by Helio Castroneves.


The crash relegated Castroneves to a 19th-place finish and dropped him from third to fifth in points, 113 behind Pagenaud.

As calls grow louder across the political spectrum for an update to the Federal Reserve's duties and structural framework, a former high-ranking central bank adviser on Monday joined with a group of reform-minded activists in laying out plans for a newly formatted Fed.


Andrew Levin, who spent two decades at the central bank and was at one point a special adviser to former Chairman Ben Bernanke and then-Vice Chair Janet Yellen, teamed up with officials at the Economic Policy Institute and the Center for Popular Democracy, detailing tweaks and adjustments that they feel would make the Fed more accountable, more efficient and more inclusive.


The report, first profiled by The Wall Street Journal, details a host of grievances that boil down to two primary categories – accountability and diversity. The details of these complaints are broken down below:


1. According to the report, the Fed is "literally owned and controlled by commercial and Wall Street banks."




RELATED CONTENT







Much ado has been raised in recent years over transparency within the Fed. This is partly because each of the Fed's 12 regional banks functions – in the Board of Governors' own words – "similarly to private institutions." The Fed as a whole is not subjected to the same level of scrutiny as other government institutions, so Freedom of Information Act requests, for example, are not always a viable option for accessing what some argue should be public information.


Although the Board of Governors generally takes issue with the thought of any entity or group effectively "owning" regional banks, it is true that the Fed first issued regional bank stocks to commercial banks decades ago to help fund the system itself – in the process giving the private bank stockholders a voice in electing senior officials in the bank. Levin and his colleagues argue that this structure gives commercial banks and private-sector institutions "tremendous control over America's monetary policy."


2. Fed officials' election process, according to the report, is "broken, opaque and filled with conflicts of interest" and predominantly skewed toward white men.


Regional Fed officials are typically appointed either internally or through a voting process that includes stockholders in the private sector. Levin and his colleagues take issue with this process and especially with newly appointed officials' ties to Goldman Sachs. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari and Dallas President Robert Kaplan all took office within the last year, and all three have played significant roles at Goldman over the course of their respective careers.




RELATED CONTENT







But Levin and his colleagues also point out the general lack of diversity and sense of homogeneity at the Fed – a critique that's been leveled against the Fed for years. Between 1996 and 2015, 80 percent of confirmed nominees to the Board of Governors hailed from the East Coast. Only two of the 12 current regional bank presidents are women, and Yellen is the first female chair of the central bank in its history. There's also never been an African-American nor a Hispanic president of a regional Fed bank since the central bank was first greenlighted by President Woodrow Wilson more than 100 years ago.


Criticisms of the Fed have been hurled from Republican and Democratic circles alike of late. Prominent Republicans like Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas have vowed to support legislation that would dismantle the Fed, open it up to congressionally enforced auditing and chain it to automatic rules that would provide a more straightforward – though debatably more effective – monetary policy stance.


Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, at the other end of the spectrum, has grilled Yellen in recent months over what's been perceived as a general lack of diversity and inclusiveness within the Fed's governing body. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has supported Warren's efforts, and progressives have increasingly called for the central bank to take a more active role in reining in Wall Street profits.


Levin's solution weds Republican requests for transparency with Democratic demands for diversity. Under Levin and his colleagues' idealized system, the 12 regional banks would be made fully public, which would allow the Fed to "increase its net income, bringing in an estimated $3 billion in additional federal revenue over 10 years."


The authors of the report would also bar "representatives and employees of financial institutions" from serving as regional bank directors, instead allowing the Board of Governors to appoint such positions "after consulting elected officials; community, consumer and labor organizations; academics and other representatives of the public within the region."




RELATED CONTENT







Finally, the group would strike some of the exemptions that regional Fed banks have hidden behind in recent years to bypass FOIA requests.


"The entire Federal Reserve system should be subject to external reviews and disclosure requirements just like every other key public agency," the report said. "Such reviews will identify key shortcomings, risks, and opportunities for improvement and will facilitate appropriate congressional oversight."


Congress immediately oversees the responsibilities of the Fed, so congressional elections will likely mean more for the future of the central bank than the results of the presidential election – barring executive order. But Republican nominee Donald Trump has suggested he would not renew Yellen's term as Fed chair. And should Hensarling get his way, the Fed could look a lot different in 2017 than it does today.


Regardless, Levin's plans for the Fed appear to appease the loudest criticisms from both Republicans and Democrats. Its viability in Congress, however, remains to be seen.

PROVINCETOWN, Mass. (AP) — It was a very busy, very lucrative weekend for Hillary Clinton in the summer playground of the East Coast's moneyed elite.


She brunched with wealthy backers at a seaside estate in Nantucket, snacking on shrimp dumplings and crab cakes. A few hours later, she and her husband dined with an intimate party of 30 at a secluded Martha's Vineyard estate. And on Sunday afternoon, she joined the singer Cher at a "LGBT summer celebration" on the far reaches of Cape Cod.


By Sunday evening, Clinton had spoken to more than 2,200 campaign donors. But what she told the crowds remains a mystery.


Clinton has refused to open her fundraisers to journalists, reversing nearly a decade of greater transparency in presidential campaigns and leaving the public guessing at what she's saying to some of her most powerful supporters.


It's an approach that differs from the Democratic president she hopes to succeed. Since his 2008 campaign, President Barack Obama has allowed reporters traveling with him into the backyards and homes of wealthy donors to witness some of his remarks.


While reporters are escorted out of Obama's events before the start of the juicier Q&A, the president's approach offers at least a limited measure of accountability that some fear may disappear when Clinton or Republican nominee Donald Trump moves into the White House.


"Unfortunately these things have a tendency to ratchet down," said Larry Noble, the general counsel of the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center. "As the bar gets lower, it's hard to raise it again."


Clinton's campaign does release limited details about her events, naming the hosts, how many people attended and how much they gave. That's more than Trump, whose far fewer fundraisers are held entirely away from the media, with no details provided.


Even some Democrats privately acknowledge that Clinton's penchant for secrecy is a liability, given voters' continued doubts about her honesty.


While Clinton will occasionally take questions from reporters at campaign stops, she has not held a full-fledged news conference in more than 260 days — nearly nine months. Trump has held several news conferences.


Clinton refuses to release the transcripts of dozens of closed-door speeches she delivered to companies and business associations after leaving the State Department in 2013, despite significant bipartisan criticism.


And since announcing her presidential bid in April 2015, Clinton has held around 300 fundraising events. Only around five have been open to any news coverage.


"It does feed this rap about being secretive and being suspicious," said GOP strategist Whit Ayers.


Clinton's aides have promised for weeks that greater access to her events will be coming soon. But Trump's lack of disclosure about his fundraisers has given her political cover to keep the doors closed, particularly as she conducts a period of intense fundraising before the final sprint to Election Day.


The White House on Monday declined to pressure the Clinton campaign to follow its practice of allowing reporters to cover a portion of the president's remarks at some fundraisers.


"Each of the candidates is allowed to make their own case about what kind of value they place on transparency and what steps they're prepared to take to be transparent," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. "President Obama has clearly made this a priority. And he hopes that subsequent presidents will as well."


While Clinton is expected to make only two public appearances before the end of August, she and her top backers will mingle with donors at no fewer than 54 events, according to a fundraising schedule obtained by The Associated Press.


Reporters covering these events wait outside, in vans, parking lots and vacant guesthouses — even at homes they've entered with Obama at previous events. In Provincetown on Sunday, five reporters crowded into the corner of a parking lot as they tried to catch Clinton's speech to about 1,000 supporters.


The candidate could faintly be heard running through her standard stump speech.


During a Saturday fundraiser at a stately Martha's Vineyard estate, faint cheers could be heard as Clinton addressed 700 donors on a green lawn overlooking the water. Staffers instructed drivers to roll up the windows of vans where reporters waited before being ushered into a nearby guesthouse.


What a candidate tells rich donors has long been a subject of speculation in American politics, partly because the message can be different than what they offer voters.


Obama is still haunted by a comment he made at a 2008 fundraiser in San Francisco, calling voters in small-town Pennsylvania "bitter" and saying they cling to "guns or religion." He learned a lesson: At events during his 2012 campaign, staffers set up a table where guests were expected to check their cellphones before entering. Clinton has tried to ban tweeting, Instagram and other forms of social media at some events.


Four years ago, a waiter recorded and leaked remarks GOP nominee Mitt Romney made at a closed Florida fundraiser about the "47 percent" of voters who are dependent on government and would vote for Obama "no matter what." After his convention, Romney started opening his fundraisers to the media to grab headlines, especially on days when he had no other public appearances.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The top U.S. commander for the fight against the Islamic State group said Monday that he is skeptical of any additional military cooperation with Russia in Syria.


And he said he believes he can get the mission done without it, outlining new plans to accelerate the pace and scope of the U.S.-led coalition operations to retake the key Islamic State-held cities of Raqqa and Mosul within the next year.


In a wide-ranging telephone interview from Baghdad, Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend said that any decision to cooperate with Moscow is one for the Obama administration to make.


But, "as a soldier, I'm fairly skeptical of the Russians," Townsend told The Associated Press. "I'm not sure how much I'm inclined to believe that we can cooperate with them."


Townsend's comments on Russia reflect a broader U.S. military reluctance to work more closely with Moscow on operations in Syria, despite requests from Russia to the U.S. to join forces against the Islamic State group in Syria. The U.S. is reluctant to cooperate with Moscow because of its alliance with President Bashar Assad; the U.S. is backing rebels who are fighting the Islamic State but who are also in Assad's sights.


Last week, U.S. aircraft scrambled twice to protect American commandos because Syrian government warplanes were bombing nearby.


The U.S. routinely speaks to the Russians in order to ensure safe flight operations over Syria and to prevent collisions. In the wake of the Syrian incidents, the U.S. sent its warning message to Syria through the Russians, who have an ongoing, closer relationship with the Syrians.


Townsend, who took command on Sunday, also said he plans to step up the military operations in Iraq.


"We're going to strike more targets, we're going to strike them at a faster tempo," said Townsend, explaining that he wants to give the Iraqi forces the time and space to reset and prepare to retake the northern city of Mosul.


As part of that, he said he also will increase the training and equipping of Iraqi forces, including a new effort to provide combat training to Iraqi police. The police, he said, will likely face fighting as they follow Army forces into the cities and try to maintain control of the area and provide security for the citizens living there.


"In this kind of environment, even the police need some combat training like soldiers — that's something we haven't done a lot of," said Townsend, adding that the U.S. and some coalition allies will do that training.


Townsend expressed optimism that Islamic State militants will be defeated in their two main headquarters — Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria — over the next year. But acknowledging that the battles will be complicated and difficult, Townsend said it may well take the bulk of that year to meet his goals.


The Islamic State group once controlled large swaths of Iraq and Syria, and has used Raqqa as the de facto capital of the group's self-styled caliphate. But the group has suffered a string of defeats in recent months by local forces aided and backed by the U.S.-led coalition.


Townsend said he wants to retake both main cities on his yearlong watch.


"I think we may have to use all that time but, look, I'm a combat commander and I have a mission," he added. "And I don't intend to turn this over to whoever has to come behind me. It's my intent to get it done."


Iraqi officials have suggested they plan to begin the effort to retake Mosul later this fall, and the fight for Raqqa could also start within that timeline. Townsend's vow to have both retaken in the next year only underscores how difficult U.S. commanders believe it will be to drive Islamic State insurgents from those larger, heavily populated strongholds.


The U.S. and Iraqi forces are establishing a logistics hub at Qayyarah air base south of Mosul, and Townsend said that American forces could begin moving to the base in the next couple of weeks. Right now construction is still being done to prepare the base and build up its defenses.


He also said that as the battle for Mosul gets closer, U.S. advisers may once again accompany Iraqi forces at the battalion level, which is closer to the fight.


Last month, the U.S. revealed that American advisers had for the first time accompanied an Iraqi battalion in order to provide advice on how to secure a temporary bridge the Iraqis had installed over the Tigris River. President Barack Obama gave commanders the authority in April to deploy advisers at the lower level headquarters, but commanders have done that sparingly so far.


"We're about to do larger operations of greater intensity so you could expect that we'll see something like that again," said Townsend Monday. "We will use that capability and authority when situations require it."


Prior to Obama's go-ahead, the U.S. military was not permitted to place advisers at echelons lower than division headquarters, which are farther from the front lines.

SAN SIMEON, Calif. (AP) — Growing wildfires fed by windy, dry conditions have destroyed buildings and forced evacuations in central California, eastern Washington and elsewhere.


Crews in both states fought to contain the blazes Monday, with firefighters making headway in the Golden State while authorities counted at least 16 homes burned in the Northwest.


Here's a look at major wildfires in the West:


A growing wildfire in central California had charred nearly 50 square miles by Monday, while a destructive blaze in Southern California was mostly under control.


Nearly 1,900 structures were threatened by a blaze in coastal San Luis Obispo and Monterey counties, where more than 2,400 people were under evacuation orders.


The fire was 35 percent contained after destroying 34 homes and 14 other buildings.


Eighty miles up the coast, California's biggest fire grew to nearly 135 square miles in rugged wilderness coast along Highway 1 north of Big Sur.


More than 400 homes remained threatened by the fire.


Meanwhile, a 58-square-mile fire that destroyed 105 homes in Southern California was almost entirely contained and all evacuation orders were lifted.


Wildfires in the Spokane area have burned more than a dozen homes and forced evacuations.


One blaze west of the eastern Washington city had destroyed at least six homes and scorched more than 9 square miles by Monday morning, the Department of Natural Resources said.


The Lincoln County Sheriff's Office said 11 structures were destroyed near the town of Davenport, a figure that includes homes, garages and outbuildings.


The fire jumped the Spokane River and threatened the small community of Wellpinit on the Spokane Indian Reservation. Residents were told to evacuate after the town lost power.


Another wildfire, south of Spokane near the town of Spangle, destroyed at least 10 homes and numerous other buildings Sunday, according to the Washington State Patrol.


A third blaze was burning on the northeast side of the city. That fire had scorched 250 acres, and officials said some homes were likely destroyed.


The largest fire in Yellowstone National Park in northwest Wyoming grew to about 35 square miles amid windy, warm weather, but tourists could still visit the popular park during the busy summer season.


All the park's main tourist facilities and roads were open Monday, although the fire was creeping toward a key road linking the West Entrance with the park's interior.


The blaze has charred mostly remote forest between West Yellowstone, Montana, a border town just outside the park's western boundary, and the Madison Junction recreational area within the park.


The flames expanded by nearly 10 square miles Sunday. It's one of four fires burning in Yellowstone, and warm, windy weather was expected again Monday.


Authorities ordered people in a rural area of northwestern Montana to evacuate before dawn Monday after a wildfire doubled in size in one day.


The Sanders County Sheriff's Office told people to leave their homes outside the small town of Thompson Falls. Wind gusts of up to 40 mph were expected to blow across the dry, hot terrain, stoking extreme fire behavior.


Some 20 homes and other buildings were threatened, and other residents were told that the evacuation area may spread.


Some 317 firefighters are responding to the blaze, which grew by 4½ square miles Sunday to nearly 11 square miles.

California's Supreme Court could clear the way for a new era of gold prospectors more than a century after the state's historic Gold Rush.

By SUDHIN THANAWALA, Associated Press


SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — California's ban on the use of suction dredges to extract gold from rivers is legal and not overridden by a 19th century federal law that allows mining on federal land, the California Supreme Court ruled Monday.


The court's unanimous decision was a victory for environmentalists and a blow to miners, who argued that the ban essentially stopped gold mining because doing it by hand is labor intensive and makes the enterprise unprofitable.


Environmentalists say suction dredge mining risks killing fish and stirring up toxic mercury.


The high court's ruling came in an appeal of a criminal case in which miner Brandon Rinehart was convicted of a misdemeanor for suction dredge mining without a permit in 2012 and sentenced to three years of probation.


Associate Justice Kathryn Werdegar, writing for the court, said the federal Mining Law of 1872 did not guarantee a right to mine free from regulation.


Instead, its goal was to protect miners' property rights involving the federal land to which they laid claim, she said.


"The mining laws were neither a guarantee that mining would prove feasible nor a grant of immunity against local regulation, but simply an assurance that the ultimate original landowner, the United States, would not interfere by asserting its own property rights," she wrote.


Rinehart's attorney, James Buchal, said the high court showed a "casual disregard" for federal law.


He said Rinehart would likely ask the court to review its ruling or appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.


Suction dredges are powerful underwater vacuums that suck up rocks, gravel and sand from riverbeds to filter out gold.


State officials argued their right to protect the environment was not pre-empted by federal mining law. Miners countered that the state failed to show suction dredge mining killed any fish.


The court's ruling came more than a century after the famous California gold rush that brought tens of thousands of miners to the state from around the country.


California has experienced a mini-gold rush of sorts in recent years, as low water levels caused by the drought have lured amateur prospectors to riverbed spots that have been out of reach for decades.


There are over 20,000 mining claims on federal lands in California. Suction dredge mining largely occurs in mountain regions.


California passed a law last year that allows state officials to resume granting permits for suction dredge mining under certain conditions that include making sure the practice does not have any significant effect on fish and wildlife. The conditions have not yet been met, so no permits have been granted.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Syria has been warned not to fly warplanes in areas where American troops are advising Kurdish and Arab forces fighting the Islamic State group, the Pentagon said on Monday. But it insisted this does not amount to a "no fly zone."


Reporters pushed press secretary Peter Cook to explain the distinction.


"Our warning to the Syrians is the same that we've had for some time, that we're going to defend our forces and they would be advised not to fly in areas where our forces have been operating," Cook said.


"It's not a 'no fly zone,'" he added. Later, he said, "You can label it what you want."


Twice last week the U.S. scrambled fighter aircraft to protect American special operations forces and partner forces after Syrian government warplanes flew near the northeastern Syrian city of Hassakeh. Cook said there have been no similar incidents since Friday.


"If need be we will send aircraft again to defend our forces," he said.


Cook said the most recent warnings to Syria not to fly in areas near U.S. troops were communicated through the Russian military, which is operating in support of the Syrian government in its fight against opposition forces, including the Islamic State militants.


Asked whether the U.S. policy is to shoot down a Syrian or Russian aircraft if it poses a threat to U.S. troops on the ground, Cook said, "We're going to defend our forces on the ground, absolutely."


Cook was highly critical of Syrian military action in and around the divided city of Aleppo, which has become a main battlefield in Syria's civil war. Relentless shelling and airstrikes have killed more than 300 civilians in the city since rebels broke through a government blockade of the opposition-held east on July 31.


"The Syrian regime aided and abetted by its allies, Russia and Iran, is driving the escalation with its indiscriminate bombing campaign," Cook said. "Bombing densely populated urban areas, interrupting water and electrical services and maiming civilians is only adding fuel to Syria's civil war and does nothing to degrade extremist groups, which was of course Russia's original reason for its military intervention in Syria."

CITRONELLE, Ala. (AP) — A Mississippi man admitted killing at least one of the five adults found dead at a rural home where his estranged girlfriend had sought shelter amid allegations of abuse, a sheriff said Monday.


Hours after the slayings, Derrick Dearman, 27, walked into the sheriff's office in Leakesville, Mississippi, "stating that he had killed someone or more than one person in Citronelle, Alabama," Greene County Sheriff Stanley McLeod said in a statement.


The slayings, which happened at the end of a dirt road outside Citronelle, left three men and two women dead. The victims included a pregnant woman and her unborn child.


Authorities said Dearman abducted his estranged girlfriend Laneta Lester and a child from the house after the slayings, but both were later released unharmed. The home belonged to Lester's brother, who was among the victims and had let his sister stay there because she was afraid of Dearman, friends and relatives of the victims said.


A teenager who said she was related to all five victims by marriage or blood shook her head and fought away tears as she described her anguish over the slayings.


"They were really good people. They'd call and check on you, ask if you want to come down and eat," said Madison McDaniel, 17, who lives near the scene of the horrific violence.


Relatives of the victims started an online fundraiser to help cover funeral expenses, and clerk Dawn Sullivan collected donations in a plastic jug on the counter at D&B Quick Stop, where the victims often stopped for snacks and drinks.


"It's a sad situation. It never should have gotten to that point," said Sullivan, whose husband was related to one of the victims.


Dearman, 27, of Leakesville, will be charged with six counts of capital murder, including one charge for the unborn child, Mobile County sheriff's spokeswoman Lori Myles said. He was being held Monday in a Mississippi jail awaiting transfer to the county jail in Mobile, Alabama.


Alabama court records don't indicate whether Dearman has an attorney who could speak on his behalf.


The slain were identified as Shannon Melissa Randall, 35; Joseph Adam Turner, 26; Justin Kaleb Reed, 23; Chelsea Marie Reed, 22; and Robert Lee Brown, Myles said.


Turner was the brother of Dearman's estranged girlfriend and had let her stay at the house, which all the victims shared, McDaniel and Sullivan said. Turner and Randall were married.


"I'd always get on my horse and ride down there bareback," McDaniel said. Her step-aunt Randall would say, "'Be careful because you're already got a hurt knee.' I'd say, 'OK Shan-Shan.' That's what I called her."


Brown was Randall's brother, McDaniel said, and Chelsea Reed was Randall's niece. Chelsea Reed was pregnant with the child of her husband, Justin Reed, said McDaniel.


Around 1 a.m. Saturday, someone inside the home called 911 and reported that Dearman was on the property, authorities said in a statement. Citronelle police came to the house, but Dearman had left before the officers arrived, sheriff's officials said.


Before daylight Saturday, Dearman returned to the home and attacked the victims while they were sleeping, the sheriff's department said. Mobile County District Attorney Ashley Rich said "multiple weapons" were used.


After the killings, Dearman forced Lester and a 3-month-old identified by relatives as the child of Randall and Turner into a vehicle, and they drove to Dearman's father's house in Mississippi. Dearman released Lester and the infant and turned himself in, authorities said.


Dearman's ex-wife Crystal Dearman told WALA-TV the man "always had a temper, especially when he doesn't get his way."


"I woke up to him holding a knife to my throat in bed with my baby in the crib," said Dearman, who said the two divorced in 2010. "He's made threats the entire time we were together and after we separated."

EVERETT, Wash. (AP) — A 19-year-old man accused of shooting three former classmates to death at a house party in suburban Seattle has pleaded not guilty to murder charges.


The Daily Herald ( http://bit.ly/2bxwG39 ) reports Allen Ivanov entered the pleas during a brief hearing Monday afternoon in Snohomish County Superior Court.


Ivanov has been charged with three counts of aggravated murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder. He is being held without bail.


Police say Ivanov was upset that his ex-girlfriend, Anna Bui, appeared to be moving on with her life after their recent breakup.


In addition to Bui, of Everett, Jordan Ebner, of Lake Stevens, and Jacob Long, of Everett, were killed in the July 30 shooting. They were all 19 and recent graduates of Kamiak High School in Mukilteo, a waterfront city of 21,000 people

Here at last is the long-awaited Donald Trump campaign pivot in all of its glory. Having locked down the "alt-right" vote, the Republican nominee is slowly but unmistakably repositioning his campaign to ... insult African-Americans, Latinos and women (and maybe even his white nationalist base).


Ever since his latest campaign shakeup last week, Trump has gotten a lot of attention for finally, finally making a general election pivot and starting to woo African-American and Latino voters. He's even displayed startling fidelity to his prepared speech texts! But Trump's idea of wooing seems to have more to do with negging – the "seduction" "technique" based on mildly insulting someone with the aim of making them crave your approval – than genuine interest.


So Trump insults the intelligence of Latino voters by signaling a ham-handed reversal of his oft- and unequivocally stated intent to deport all 11 million people living in this country without legal permission: Meeting Saturday with his Hispanic advisory board, Trump "suggested he is interested in figuring out a 'humane and efficient' manner to deal with immigrants in the country illegally," Buzzfeed's Adrian Carrasquillo reported. The gist of his comments, per Buzzfeed, were that he's open to different ideas about how to deal with that group, which he has previously said would be handled with a "deportation force." 


Newly minted Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway followed up with a CNN appearance on Sunday saying that he wanted to be "fair and humane" to those living here without documentation and that the fate of his deportation squad is "to be determined." Finally, Monday morning Trump went on "Fox and Friends" to declare himself to be "not flip-flopping" while at the same time "working with a lot of people in the Hispanic community to try to come up with an answer." This particular bit of spin prompted Hot Air's Allahpundit to wonder: "I ... thought he already came up with an answer for illegals, namely, mass deportation. Did I dream that?"


Trump is – clumsily – doing one of two things here. One possibility is he's preparing to walk back his extremist position on illegal immigration, a move which would require voters to simply forget pretty much everything he's said to this point in the campaign (requiring an Etch A Sketch so big it would make Mitt Romney jealous). He's stuck steadfastly by his maximalist anti-immigration stance even as he's tried at various times to soften his anti-Muslim proposals. (Someone please explain to me the political logic of taking a softer line on Muslims than Latinos.) The other option is that he's trying to change perceptions by repeatedly using words like "fair" and "humane" to describe a policy which would be manifestly the opposite of those things. Either way, he seems to assume incredible obtuseness on the part of swing voters generally and Hispanics in particular.


But at least he's not directly insulting Hispanics here. He saves that for black voters. So here's Trump "reaching out" to African-American voters last Friday night at a campaign rally in Dimondale, Michigan (a city, The Washington Post helpfully points out, that is 90 minutes from Detroit and has a population that's 93 percent white): "What do you have to lose?" Trump asked hypothetical black voters. "You're living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?"


(Yeah, I thought that was an unfair paraphrase the first time I saw it online too. But no.)


Where to begin? Does it bear pointing out that Trump's facts are (again) wrong? Yes it does, so I commend to you the Philadelphia Daily News' Will Bunch, who dissects Trump's claims and concludes that "Trump and his advisers act like everything they learned about black America comes from 'blaxploitation' movies of the 1970s, the same era when the government said Trump and his dad discriminated against would-be black tenants." (African-Americans shouldn't feel too bad: Trump does the same thing to cities and, well, pretty much everything else.) Is it any wonder that Trump has been known to poll as low as 0 percent among blacks in battleground polls and little better than that nationally?




Trump polls 1-2% among blacks. In '64 Goldwater got 6% after voting no on the Civil Rights Act. In '68 segregationist George Wallace won 3%.— Larry Sabato (@LarrySabato) August 21, 2016




At 1-2 percent Trump is on course to do worse than John McCain, who got 4 percent against the first African-American nominee in the country's history. But hey, his words were not without apparent benefit: "I'm white," Conway said on ABC's "This Week" on Sunday. "I was very moved by his comment."


And to the extent that she's right, he did, in fact, achieve his actual end. Trump is less interested in appealing to nonwhite voters than in convincing white Republicans that he's sufficiently nonthreatening as to be an acceptable vehicle for anti-Hillary votes.


Conway's specific brief is helping Trump improve his dismal polling numbers among women, so she must have been simply delighted to see his Twitter feed Monday morning, where he was launching classically sexist attacks on MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski and her "Morning Joe" co-host, Joe Scarborough:




Some day, when things calm down, I'll tell the real story of @JoeNBC and his very insecure long-time girlfriend, @morningmika. Two clowns!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 22, 2016




She's dumb, crazy and sleeping with her coworker? Congratulations, Donald Trump, you managed to score a misogynist hat trick in only two tweets!


It remains a 2016 truism: The more Donald Trump pivots, the more he stays the same.






No sooner had the 2016 Olympic Games finished than commentators were lamenting their negative impacts on the host city, Rio de Janeiro. Many have concluded that a sustainable Olympic legacy is either uncertain, or downright impossible. But while these tales of doom and gloom make for dramatic headlines, the reality is not so grim.


The international press have always been pessimistic about Brazil's ability to stage the Olympics. Before the games began, a steady flow of articles critiqued the preparations, condemned forced evictions and cast doubt on whether vital infrastructure would be delivered on schedule. Admittedly, in the context of the ongoing economic crisis and political turmoil, there was – and still is – good cause for concern. But it is important not to get fixed on controversies as the only source of truth.


Once the games started, the city was given a short break and the focus moved to the wonders of sport - and obsessive medal counting. But after many were swept up in the thrill of the games themselves, it didn't take long for the criticisms to return. In contrast with this bleak picture, my own research on Rio throughout the games fortnight, building on a framework that interrogates the cultural dimensions of this as well as eight previous host cities since Sydney 2000, reveal a different dimension of the Olympic city this summer.


The people I spoke to were frustrated that uplifting stories about the urban, social and cultural changes taking place in Rio were not being picked up by journalists. This was especially clear in Rio's favelas, where I conducted the bulk of my research. These informal slum-like settlements span across the city's hills and have attracted worldwide attention for their poor living conditions and the high crime rates, associated with drug dealing.


While internal gang wars have resulted in targeted violence for decades, favela residents insist they are also part of strong and optimistic communities. Those outside of gang rivalries say that they feel safe and well supported within their neighborhood, and that culture and creativity has always been a source of empowerment.


In particular, cultural activists working in the favelas, such as DJ Zezinho and Obi Wan, told me that they were fed up with being asked to talk about everything that is wrong in Rio. They said that their community life is thriving and opportunities are opening up for residents like Obi Wan, who got a grant to study at a private school and is now running a popular youth hostel and favela tours.

Artists (both home-bred and adopted) are also bringing about positive changes to their neighborhoods. The International Olympic Committee's first artist-in-residence – photographer and street artist JR – has taken a prominent role in a number of projects at the Olympic Games.


His work ranges from the monumental Giants to portraits of Olympic participants (InsideOut), to small, community-focused interventions – such as a cultural center, Casa Amarela, based in one of Rio's oldest favelas.


What's more, the first favela-based libraries are opening up, and the new Olympic metro line will improve accessibility to Rio's most prominent favela, Rocinha. Residents are hopeful that this will finally make it plain that favelas are truly a part of Rio – they weren't even recognized on official maps until 2013).


Of course, locals' reactions to the Olympics aren't all positive. One Rocinha resident pointed out: "We are not allowed to use the metro until after the games – at the moment, only Olympic competition ticket holders can." But in the wake of extensive drug lord removals and pacification – a controversial but transformative effort to fight crime in the favelas, which was accelerated as the Olympics were looming – no one denies that the big event has helped advance important social causes and address essential public infrastructure needs.


It's not just residents of the favelas who are feeling some benefits from hosting the games. Despite Rio's reputation for being a city of great inequality, it does actually have a substantial middle class. Between 60 percent and 75 percent of its population live in four large districts: the historic, downtown Centro, the flashy Zona Sul, the largely low-income, residential Zona Norte and the suburbs of the west side.


The latter includes Barra da Tijuca – the site of the main Olympic Park, which is rapidly developing as new, more wealthy communities move in. The Olympic Games have given Rio's middle-class residents – particularly those in Centro and Zona Norte – a chance to participate in the debate around the kind of city Rio is, and could be.


Both city and Olympic officials have made much of the claim that 63 percent of the population now have access to public transport (up from 18 percent, seven years ago). But an equally important (and, culturally, more significant) Olympic legacy for Rio is the rediscovery of its public spaces, as areas for people to meet and mingle.

Just as Barcelona rediscovered its port during the 1992 Olympics, Rio has reconnected with the long-derelict Porto Maravilhas. The Porto borders downtown Centro, an area which bustles with office workers from all across the city during the week.


But up until recently, Centro lacked public meeting spaces, and was considered an unsafe, no-go area in the evenings and on weekends. This has changed dramatically for the duration of the Olympic Games (and carrying on into the Paralympics). Porto Maravilhas has been rebranded as the Boulevard Olimpico – and suddenly, it's the place to be.


A dedicated Olympic "live site", where fans can watch the action on big screens, the Boulevard Olimpico owes its success to the ingenious combination of a diverse cultural offering (including the new Museum of Tomorrow and the revamped Museum of Art in Rio) with business displays and entertainment.


What's more, the thoughtful way the space has been used sparked a flurry of street artists (five so far, and counting) to take over old warehouse walls and produce enormous graffiti artworks.


And this is only the second time – after Vancouver's Winter Olympics in 2010 – that an Olympic Cauldron was placed outside the sports venue, giving those without tickets the chance to experience one the most recognizable Olympic icons first hand.


So, Cariocas have flocked in their thousands to the Boulevard Olympico. They have fully embraced this new part of their city: there will be no white elephants here. The port has passed from no-go to must-go area in a matter of months and, given its position as meeting point for daily commuters, it is set to become one of the most lively and diverse public places in the city.


The Parque Madureira, in the northern part of the city, is another example of urban regeneration leaving a positive legacy for the local community. Located in a densely populated, low-income area, which is dominated by factory infrastructure, this new park has brought greenery, sporting facilities and new cultural life to a neighborhood of more than 350,000 people.

Rio is a big city. With Olympic activities dotted across the four main districts, hardcore sports fans have been forced to spend a considerable part of their day in transit. Because of this, visitors have been exposed to the many sides of Rio, beyond the sandy beaches in Copacabana and the dirty streets in the slums.


Above all else, the games have showcased the generous spirit of the Carioca. While in Rio, I witnessed the locals' thrill at discovering new spaces to gather, exercise and party; their enjoyment and surprise at mixing with people from other districts – often, for the first time, given the city's longstanding north-south economic divide, and their refusal to be confined by stereotypes and condemned to repeat the same social and cultural mistakes.


There are hard times ahead; the country still faces an ongoing recession and political turmoil. But the Olympic Games have opened up new public spaces, giving everyone the chance to generate positive collective memories – with the Paralympics yet to come. Rather than taking on a defeatist, "can't-do" attitude, there is much to be gained by paying attention to what's gone right in Rio.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans stepped up their attacks on Monday on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server and pointed to newly released messages to allege that foreign donors to the Democratic presidential nominee's family charity got preferential treatment from her department.


Congressional Republicans issued subpoenas to three technology companies that either made or serviced the server located in the basement of Clinton's New York home. The subpoenas were issued Monday by House Science, Space and Technology Chairman Lamar Smith of Texas with the support of Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.


In a joint statement, Smith and Johnson said the move was necessary after the three companies — Platte River Networks, Datto Inc. and SECNAP Network Security Corp. — declined to voluntarily answer questions to determine whether Clinton's private server met government standards for record-keeping and security.


The subpoenas were among several developments Monday that showed a new GOP emphasis on Clinton's emails after the FBI recently closed its yearlong probe into whether she and her aides mishandled sensitive government information that flowed through her server, without recommending criminal charges.


The State Department is now reviewing nearly 15,000 previously undisclosed emails recovered as part of the FBI investigation. Lawyers for the department told U.S. District Court Judge James E. Boasberg on Monday that they anticipate processing and releasing the first batch of these new emails in mid-October, raising the prospect that new messages sent or received by Clinton could become public just before November's election.


Boasberg is overseeing production of the emails as part of a federal public-records lawsuit filed by the conservative legal advocacy group Judicial Watch. Representing the State Department, Justice Department lawyer Lisa Olson told the judge that officials do not yet know what portion of the emails is work-related, rather than personal.


Clinton, who was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, had claimed that she deleted only personal emails prior to returning more than 55,000 pages of her work-related messages to the State Department last year. The department has publicly released most of those emails, although some have been withheld because they contain information considered sensitive to national security.


The thousands of previously undisclosed Clinton emails obtained by the FBI came from the accounts of other people she communicated with or were recovered through the bureau's forensic examination of her old server.


Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon reiterated Monday that Clinton provided all the work-related emails she had "in her possession" when the State Department asked for copies in 2014. He said "if the State Department determines any of them to be work-related, then obviously we support those documents being released publicly as well."


Olson said the department earlier this month received seven discs containing "tens of thousands" of emails Clinton sent or received during her tenure as the nation's top diplomat. The first disc, labeled by the FBI as containing nonclassified emails not previously disclosed by Clinton, contains about 14,900 documents, she said. The second is labeled as emails containing classified information.


She said it was "extremely ambitious" for the agency to complete its review and begin releasing the first batches of emails to Judicial Watch by Oct. 14, given the volume of messages. Judicial Watch lawyer Lauren Burke called that schedule too slow and pressed for faster release of the emails from the first disc. The judge ordered the department to report back to him by Sept. 22.


Also on Monday, Judicial Watch released 20 previously undisclosed email exchanges involving Clinton that were turned over by her former deputy chief of staff, Huma Abedin.


Among them is a June 23, 2009, message to Abedin from Doug Band, a longtime aide to former President Bill Clinton who then was an official at the Clinton family's charitable foundation. Republicans charge that donors to the foundation, including foreign governments and corporations, got preferential treatment from the State Department while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.


Band sought to arrange for the crown prince of Bahrain to meet with Hillary Clinton while the prince was visiting Washington. "Good friend of ours," Band wrote to Abedin, one of Clinton's closest aides.


Crown Prince Salman had in 2005 made a $32 million commitment to the Clinton Global Initiative, a program run by the foundation.


In later emails Abedin confirmed that Clinton would meet with the prince. Copies of Clinton's calendar obtained by AP confirm the meeting occurred in her State Department office on June 26, 2009.


State Department spokesman Matt Toner said Monday there was nothing improper or unusual about the messages with Clinton Foundation staff.


"There was no impropriety," Toner said. "This was simply evidence of the way the process works in that, you know, any secretary of state has aides who are getting emails or contacts by a broad range of individuals and organizations."

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey is withdrawing its ambassador to Austria, the Turkish foreign minister said Monday, amid a growing diplomatic spat.


Mevlut Cavusoglu said Ambassador Hasan Gogus was called back to Ankara for "consultations and to review ties," citing Austrian authorities' decision to allow alleged supporters of Turkey's Kurdish rebels to hold a demonstration in Vienna over the weekend as well as rising anti-Turkish rhetoric in Austria.


Ties between Turkey and Austria have been tense for several weeks, with a top Austrian official saying Turkey was heading toward a dictatorship and other leaders calling for an end to Turkey's European Union membership talks.


Turkey, in turn, has described Austria as the "capital of radical racism."


"We saw that ... the PKK and its supporters were given permission to stage a demonstration in Vienna," Cavusoglu said. "This does not comply with honesty or sincerity. We couldn't stay inactive against this attitude which supports terrorism." He was referring to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which Turkey and its allies consider a terror organization.


Fighting between the PKK and Turkey's security forces resumed last year after a fragile peace process collapsed. The group has stepped up attacks targeting police and military in Turkey and at least a dozen people were killed in a string of bombings last week.


Cavusoglu said Austria's top diplomat in Ankara was also called to the ministry over the demonstration in Vienna.


There was no immediate response from Austrian officials.


"Unfortunately, the ground for our bilateral relations and cooperation to continue as normal has disappeared," Cavusoglu said.

BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Flash floods trapped 11 people, including four French citizens Monday in a huge bat cave in western Romania. Two were later rescued and authorities said there was no danger to the remaining nine.


A spokeswoman for the local emergency services, Alina Marescu, told The Associated Press that most of those stranded in the cave by the flood that came after torrential rain on Monday afternoon were aged 15-17. She said two people were later rescued.


Two of those trapped by the water were experienced speleologists, or those who study caves, Marescu said.


Another emergency spokeswoman, Mihaela Albu, told Mediafax private news agency that the remaining nine were not in any danger.


Marescu told the AP there was room for people to take shelter in the Huda lui Papara cave, a massive cave which is home to the largest bat colony in Europe, located in the Apuseni Mountains in the northwestern Transylvania region.


Specialized teams from three counties were trying to rescue those trapped and Marescu said water levels were falling.

Is a 12-year-old really running Republican Donald Trump's presidential campaign in Jefferson County, Colorado?


Broadcast reports describe Weston Imer (EYE'-mer) as running the field operation in the state's fourth most populous county. The boy's mother, Laurel Imer, is technically in charge but says she's ceded responsibility to her son until school starts.


Trump's Colorado co-chair, Robert Blaha, says while the campaign likes to have Weston speak at rallies and knock on doors, he's not the campaign office boss.


Says Blaha in an interview: "There's not the possibility a 12-year-old can run an office."


Colorado is traditionally a swing state, but polls show Democrat Hillary Clinton opening a lead over Trump. Clinton and her allies have stopped advertising in Colorado and shifted money to more competitive states.

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Russia has stopped using an Iranian air base for launching airstrikes on Syria for the time being, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman said Monday, just hours after the Iranian defense minister criticized Moscow for having "kind of show-off and ungentlemanly" attitude by publicizing their actions.


Moscow, which had used the Shahid Nojeh Air Base to refuel its bombers striking Syria at least three times last week, confirmed that all Russian warplanes that were based in Iran have returned to Russia.


A statement issued by the Russian Defense Ministry said Monday that as long as Iran agreed, Russia could use the Iranian air base again, "depending on the situation" in Syria.


Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi told reporters in Tehran that the Russian airstrikes on militants in Syria were "temporary, based on a Russian request."


"It is finished, for now," Ghasemi said, without elaborating.


Last week, Russia announced it used the airfield, located some 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of the Iranian city of Hamedan. Iranian officials only confirmed Russia's presence a day later.


Earlier Monday, state TV quoted Iran's defense minister as saying that Russia "will use the base for a very short and fixed span." The comments by Gen. Hossein Dehghan came after he chastised parliament this weekend for asking questions about Russia using the base.


Responding to a question about why Iran didn't initially announce Russia's presence at the airfield, Dehghan appeared prickly on the state TV broadcast.


"Russians are interested to show they are a superpower to guarantee their share in political future of Syria and, of course, there has been a kind of show-off and ungentlemanly (attitude) in this field," he said.


Dehghan's remarks also suggest Russia and Iran initially agreed to keep Moscow's use of the air base quiet. Its announcement likely worried Iran's Sunni-ruled Mideast neighbors, which host American military personnel.


The Interfax news agency on Monday also quoted Russia's ambassador to Tehran, Levan Dzhagaryan, as confirming that all of Moscow's warplanes have been withdrawn from Iran. Dzhagaryan said, however, that he does "not see any reason" why the Russians can't use the Iranian base again.


For Iran, allowing Russia to launch strikes from inside the country is likely to prove unpopular. Many still remember how Russia, alongside Britain, invaded and occupied Iran during World War II to secure oil fields and Allied supply lines. But while Britain withdrew, Russia refused to leave, sparking the first international rebuke by the nascent United Nations Security Council in 1946.


Analysts have suggested Russia potentially leveraged Iran into allowing it to use the airfield over either economic or military interests, such as Tehran wanting to purchase Sukhoi-30 fighter jets or its deployment of Russian S-300 air defense missile systems. Russia initially held off on supplying the missile system to Tehran amid negotiations over Iran's contested nuclear program.


Over the weekend, photographs of President Hassan Rouhani were published in Iranian state media near a Bavar-373 missile defense system. That system is designed to be the local equivalent of the S-300 — perhaps an Iranian signal back to Moscow that it's capable of defending itself without the Russian missile system.


In his comments, Dehghan said the Bavar-373 can hit targets at the height of 27 kilometers (16.7 miles) — the same height the S-300 can reach.


"When we make Bavar-373 operational, we will not need to purchase another high-altitude and long-range air defense system," he said.


Dehghan added that Iran still sees the Sukhoi-30 as "an appropriate fighting aircraft," though he acknowledged the U.S. could seek to block any fighter jet deal. The U.N. resolution enshrining last year's nuclear deal with Iran prohibits the supply, sale and transfer of combat aircraft to Iran unless approved in advance by the Security Council.


"The issue of purchasing the fighters has been raised and we have not heard any negative answer," he said. "We are negotiating to learn how we can do this with the restriction that can be raised for the Russians."


Meanwhile, fighting continued Monday in Syria. In the northern Syrian city of Hasakeh, clashes again erupted between Kurdish fighters and pro-government militias, according to the Kurdish Hawar News Agency. The government and the Kurdish movement have shared control of the city since the early years of the Syrian civil war.


Syrian government planes bombed Kurdish positions in Hasakeh last week as the struggle for predominance in the city escalated.


Meanwhile, Turkish artillery on Monday attacked a U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish militia as well as Islamic State group positions across the border in Syria, according to Turkish media reports .


Hurriyet newspaper said the attacks targeted positions north of the town of Manbij, which a Kurdish-led force recently captured from IS.


The state-run Anadolu Agency says Turkey has increased security measures at its border opposite the Islamic State-held town of Jarablus, deploying tanks and armored personnel carriers.


Turkish officials were not immediately available to confirm the report, which came as Syrian activists claimed that hundreds of Turkish-backed Syrian opposition fighters have gathered in the Turkish border area of Karkamis in preparation for an attack on Jarablus.


Ankara is concerned about the growing power of U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish forces, who are linked to Kurdish groups waging an insurgency in southeastern Turkey.


Also Monday, U.N. humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien urged all combatants in the battle for the Syrian city of Aleppo to agree to a 48-hour pause to allow desperately needed aid to be delivered, warning of a "humanitarian catastrophe unparalleled in the over five years of bloodshed" in Syria. O'Brien told the Security Council that Aleppo is being bombed every day, including a dozen new attacks on Monday,

Forget the cliché of America's inmates begging, bartering and stealing for a pack of Camels – now they're setting their sights on Cup Noodles.


According to a recent study by Michael Gibson-Light, a doctoral candidate in the University of Arizona School of Sociology, ramen noodles have become a new form of currency among state prisoners, unseating cigarettes as the king of commodities sought in America's prisons.


Gibson-Light investigated prisons for a year from May 2015 to May 2016 and interviewed nearly 60 inmates and prison staff members, as well as observed working prisoners. He posits that ramen has become so valuable because prison services are being defunded.


"Prison staff members as well as members of the inmate population provided narratives of the history of changes in prison food — the past few decades have seen steady decreases in the quality and quantity of inmate food,” Gibson-Light explained in a press release.


“Prisoners are so unhappy with the quality and quantity of prison food that they receive that they have begun relying on ramen noodles — a cheap, durable food product — as a form of money in the underground economy,” he elaborated. "Because it is cheap, tasty, and rich in calories, ramen has become so valuable that it is used to exchange for other goods."


According to the release, per capita state corrections expenditures haven't kept pace with the number of inmates as far back as 1982. Further, states spent about $48.5 billion on corrections in 2010 – a 5.6 percent decline from the previous year.


“The form of money is not something that changes often or easily, even in the prison underground economy; it takes a major issue or shock to initiate such a change,” he said. “The use of cigarettes as money in U.S. prisons happened in American Civil War military prisons and likely far earlier. The fact that this practice has suddenly changed has potentially serious implications.”






SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Police are searching for a man who bit off a bartender's finger after being kicked out of a San Francisco bar at closing time.


Officer Carlos Manfredi said Monday that the suspect had been drinking at the bar in the Marina District on July 17 and tried to go back inside after it closed.


When he wasn't let in, the man tried to get in through a small window, and the bartender stopped him again.


Manfredi said the two got into a fight after the man began kicking the door to the bar. Police say that during the confrontation, the man bit off the bartender's ring finger.


The bartender was taken to a hospital, where he was treated for an amputated finger, swollen eyes and bruises to his head.

What would possess a man to swallow dozens of knives? 


In the recent case of a man in India, no one quite knows – including him.


The man, a 42-year-old father of two, had 40 knives surgically removed from his stomach on Friday, according to CNN.


The patient reportedly spent two months swallowing the knives and had successfully hidden the habit from his family.


"I don't know why I used to swallow knives," he explained to CNN. "I just enjoyed its taste and I was addicted ... how people get addicted to alcohol and other things, my situation was similar."


Dr. Jatinder Malhotra, who led the knife-removal operation, thinks the man has a rare mental disorder.


"He had a wild urge to consume metal. Even for us, the experienced surgeons, it was frightening," he said to CNN. 


The operation to extract the knives took five hours. Malhotra and his team spent two days diagnosing the issue and devising a plan for surgery.


"We were so nervous ... a small mistake could have taken the patient's life," he explained to CNN. "In my 20 years of practice, I have never seen anything like it."


"When we took out the knives – some were found folded, some were open, and some had even started rusting and were broken," Malhotra added.




CNN says the patient is being supervised by a psychiatric team and will also be seen by independent mental health experts. 


He has vowed never to swallow knives again.


"[My team and I] told him, 'If you ever feel like you need more iron in your body, try spinach,'" Malhotra told CNN.

NEW YORK (AP) — Retired NBA star Kobe Bryant is moving to Wall Street, announcing the formation of a $100 million venture capital fund to invest in media, technology and data companies.


The fund, known as Bryant Stibel, is being co-managed by investor Jeff Stibel. The two met through mutual friends, Stibel said.


Bryant Stibel has already made investments in 15 companies, including LegalZoom and home juicing company Juicero, according to their website. The firm was founded in 2013, but is going public now with the retirement of Bryant from the Lakers.


Stibel said the firm is focused on companies at all stages of growth.


"We are actively looking for great entrepreneurs, but we are in no hurry to deploy capital," he said.

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — A defiant Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe announced Monday that he again restored the voting rights of about 13,000 felons who served their time after his previous attempt was thwarted by Republican lawmakers and the state Supreme Court.


Virginia's highest court ruled in July that governors cannot restore rights en masse, but must consider each offender on a case-by-case basis. That ruling invalidated a sweeping executive order issued by McAuliffe in April that had given back the voting rights of more than 200,000 felons who completed their sentences.


McAuliffe blasted the court Monday for ignoring the "the clear text of the Constitution" and accused Republicans of trying to suppress voters' voices. But he pledged to move forward, saying he won't let the felon disenfranchisement "destroy lives and families, and destabilize communities."


"These individuals are gainfully employed. They send their children and their grandchildren to our schools. They shop in our grocery stores and they pay taxes. And I am not content to condemn them for eternity as inferior second-class citizens," McAuliffe said during an event at the Virginia Civil Rights Memorial.


Rights-restoration letters were mailed Friday to the roughly 13,000 people who had registered to vote before their rights were taken away by the court, McAuliffe said. His administration processed each felon's paperwork individually to comply with the ruling, he said.


Moving forward, McAuliffe will individually restore the rights of other felons who meet the requirements, giving priority to those who request it, he said. The orders also allow the felons to serve on a jury, run for public office and become a notary public.


A voter-registration application will be included in each of the rights-restoration letters sent to felons, McAuliffe said. The deadline to register to vote in Virginia for November's election is Oct. 17.


The Virginia Supreme Court's 4-3 decision striking down his executive order was a significant blow to McAuliffe, who called felon disenfranchisement a vestige of the state's Jim Crow past because it disproportionately impacts African-Americans.


Republicans have accused McAuliffe of trying to add more Democrats to the voter rolls to aid presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in November, but McAuliffe maintains his motivations weren't political. The administration recently released the names and addresses of the 13,000 who had registered, and most of them live in urban areas that typically vote Democratic.


GOP House Speaker William Howell, who sued McAuliffe over the order, said lawmakers will carefully review the process McAuliffe laid out Monday to ensure it meets the requirements set by the court.


"From the beginning, we have done nothing more than hold the governor accountable to the constitution and the rule of law. The Supreme Court's decision vindicated our efforts and we will continue to fulfill our role as a check on the excesses of executive power," Howell said in a statement.


Kenneth Williams, whose voter registration was canceled after the court ruling, said he looks forward to getting his letter saying his rights have once again been restored. The 67-year-old, who served 10 years on a robbery charge and now runs a prisoner re-entry program, said he's eager to not only vote himself, but help to register others whose rights were once stripped away.


"I made a promise to myself that I'm going to assist everyone I can to register to vote ... so they can have a voice," he said.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson has an idea for making colleges cheaper — ditch the instructors and start playing online videos for students.


The Republican senator from Wisconsin floated the idea during a question-and-answer session Thursday in Milwaukee.


He called higher education a "cartel" and suggested colleges could cut the number of instructors and increase use of online videos like Ken Burns' 11½-hour documentary on the Civil War.


Johnson, of Oshkosh, is locked in a tight re-election battle with Democratic challenger Russ Feingold.

VANCOUVER, Wash. (AP) — A firefighter who left his dog with friends as he battled wildfires in Washington state will get back his dog weeks after the animal ran away and got adopted by another family.


The Humane Society for Southwest Washington says the family decided over the weekend to return Hunter the dog to William Jones. They initially declined, saying they had bonded with the animal.


After Jones left, the black Labrador retriever jumped a fence, got picked up by animal control and was brought to a shelter earlier this month. Hunter was adopted 10 days later.


Jones told KOIN-TV in Portland that he called the Humane Society when he returned but was told nothing could be done because the adoption was legal.


The group says staff had tried to look for the owner, but the dog didn't have a microchip.

ST. LOUIS (AP) — A federal judge ruled Monday that the process of electing school board members for a district that includes Ferguson, Missouri, is biased against black voters and must be revised before another election will be allowed.


U.S. District Judge Rodney Sippel's ruling in St. Louis comes seven months after he presided over the trial in a lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed on behalf of the Missouri NAACP and three residents of the Ferguson-Florissant School District.


The lawsuit, filed soon after the August 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, alleged that the district's practice of selecting board members at large rather than by ward or sub-district makes it more difficult for black candidates to win and violates the Voting Rights Act.


"The ongoing effects of racial discrimination that have long plagued the region, and the District in particular, have affected the ability of African Americans to participate equally in the political process," he wrote in his ruling.


ACLU attorney Tony Rothert said in a statement that the ruling "is about African-American communities being able to hold their government accountable."


"Today's decision will lead to future school boards that are responsive to the needs of the community," Rothert said.


School district attorney Cindy Ormsby said the district is considering options, including whether to appeal and called the ruling disappointing.


Ormsby noted that three of the seven current board members are black, a percentage that is proportional to the racial breakdown of registered voters in the district. At the time the lawsuit was filed, the board had just one black member.


"The District continues to believe that the current at-large electoral system is best for African-American representation," Ormsby said in a statement.


Although the district is split about evenly between black and white residents, a higher percentage of whites are registered to vote. Many white parents in the district send their children to private or parochial schools, leaving black students to make up nearly four-fifths of Ferguson-Florissant's 12,000 students.


The lawsuit was filed in December 2014, four months after Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, was fatally shot during a confrontation with Darren Wilson, a white police officer, on a Ferguson street. A St. Louis County grand jury and the U.S. Department of Justice ultimately cleared Wilson, who resigned in November 2014.


Brown's death led to months of protests that grew violent at times and was a catalyst for the national Black Lives Matter movement and debate over police treatment of minorities. The shooting also prompted a federal investigation into Ferguson's police department and municipal court. The Justice Department and the city, which is a suburb of St. Louis, reached an agreement earlier this year on a plan to reduce racial bias.


The Justice Department's initial study, released in March 2015, led to the resignations of Ferguson's city manager, police chief and municipal judge, and resulted in several police and court reforms.

BRUSSELS (AP) — Belgian musician Toots Thielemans, who turned the lowly harmonica into a virtuoso jazz instrument during an illustrious career that saw him perform with such legends as Charlie Parker, has died. He was 94.


Thielemans, who also made a mark on pop culture with solos on movies and the theme for TV's "Sesame Street," died in his sleep in a Belgian hospital on Monday, his manager said. He was hospitalized last month after a fall, but had been in good spirits after an operation on his shoulder.


"He was so happy. He was doing well," manager Veerle Van de Poel said.


"We were very surprised" by his passing, she said. "He was sleeping, and he did not wake this morning."


Thielemans hung up his harmonica in 2014 as health problems made it more difficult for him to take to the stage.


Although his name wasn't widely known outside the jazz world, many heard his harmonica playing, including generations of children who grew up with the opening theme to "Sesame Street."


His harmonica was also prominently featured on movie soundtracks, including those of the Oscar-winning "Midnight Cowboy," ''The Pawnbroker," ''Jean de Florette," and "The Sugarland Express." Also adept as a whistler, he could be heard on the Old Spice after-shave commercials. He performed and recorded with Benny Goodman, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Oscar Peterson, Herbie Hancock, Quincy Jones, Paul Simon and Billy Joel, among many others.


Despite suffering from asthma much of his life, Thielemans breathed artistic life into an instrument many dismiss as a toy. In the jazz world, he was the first to use the harmonica to blow complex bebop lines. He played a custom-made Hohner chromatic harmonica - different from the diatonic harmonica used by blues players - which has a slide making it possible to play three octaves in all keys.


"It's such a freak of an instrument," Thielemans said in a 1992 AP interview. "There's technical obstacles to how fast and legato you can play. ... What I've spent my time on is to try to find things that are playable on the instrument. This is not a good instrument but I blow my brains out on it."


His zest for life was apparent in his only major hit that moved into the popular mainstream —the upbeat "Bluesette" which he first recorded in 1962, on which he showcased his signature style of whistling and playing guitar in unison.


"If there's a piece of music that describes me, it's that song," he told The AP.


Thielemans was beloved in his native Belgium, not least because he always took pride in his humble background growing up in Brussels' Marolles neighborhood.


He was ennobled by Belgium's King Albert II with the title of baron in 2001 and received the U.S. National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters award in 2009, the nation's highest jazz honor.


Belgium's royal family said it was "deeply moved by (the) passing away of Toots Thielemans, one of the greatest jazzmen."


"We have lost a great musician, a heartwarming personality. All my thoughts are with the family and friends of Toots Thielemans," Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel tweeted.


Born in Brussels on April 29, 1922, Jean-Baptiste Frederic Isidore Thielemans began playing the accordion at age 3.


He discovered jazz after the German occupation began in 1940. But after sitting in with local combos, his friends advised him to get "a real instrument."


He taught himself to play guitar, mostly by listening to records of the legendary Belgian-born Gypsy jazz guitarist, Django Reinhardt.


When he took out his harmonica again after about two years, Thielemans said it was like discovering "an old friend."


In 1945, as he was making a name for himself as a guitarist in local jazz clubs and dance halls, friends decided that his given name wasn't hip enough. So he became "Toots."


When the first bebop records by Parker and Dizzy Gillespie reached Belgium in the postwar years, Thielemans found his musical "prophets."


In 1948, he made his first visit to the United States, and stopped off in New York on his way home. An agent heard him sitting in with Howard McGhee's band at a local club, and a few months later, he received a letter at his Brussels home, inviting him to join Benny Goodman's band.


Union rules prevented the Belgian from joining the clarinetist in New York, but he appeared with Goodman's band in Europe in 1949 and 1950. Thielemans moved to New York in 1952, getting a chance to play with Parker's All-Stars.


From 1953 to 1959, he played guitar and some harmonica with pianist George Shearing's quintet, then one of the top jazz combos. While with Shearing, he added whistling to his repertoire.


His first U.S. album as a leader, "The Sound," came out in 1955. One of his favorite records was "Affinity," a 1979 session on which he played with pianist Bill Evans' trio.


Since 1959, Thielemans led his own small groups and toured internationally when not working in the studios.


Although mostly recording straight-ahead jazz albums, he released two albums in the 1990s as "The Brasil Project," featuring such prominent Brazilian artists as Dori Caymmi, Gilberto Gil, Milton Nascimento and Caetano Veloso.


A jazz festival held in his name was due to take place from Sept. 9-11 in the town of La Hulpe, about 25 kilometers (16 miles) southeast of Brussels, where Thielemans lived.


Van de Poel said his funeral will be held in the town on Saturday morning.

LAVAL, France (AP) — French farmers are occupying an intersection outside the headquarters of dairy giant Lactalis and crying for help as they struggle to compete with cheaper countries in Europe's single market.


A glut of milk and diving dairy prices are forcing French farms to sell below cost. Farmers' unions want big companies to pay more for milk than current market prices, to keep French agriculture alive.


Their protest in the western France city of Laval on Monday is targeting Lactalis, which produces Parmalat cheeses, President butter and many other dairy products on European supermarket shelves.


Lactalis argues the problem is overproduction. Spokesman Michel Nalet said on France-Inter radio that other European producers accept lower prices for their milk, and it doesn't make financial sense for his company to pay French producers more.

GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) — The drier, warmer autumn weather that's becoming more common due to climate change may extend summer smog well into the fall in the Southeastern U.S. in the years ahead, according to a study published on Monday.


Research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences also suggests a culprit for the smog that many people might not expect: It's the lush woodlands that give much of the South a lovely green canopy. That's because of a natural defense mechanism trees use to protect their leaves from drought conditions.


And since climate models predict more hot, dry Octobers in coming decades, we should expect these late-season smog, or ozone, events to happen more often, according to climatologists at the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology.


"It's not going to happen every year, but when it happens it will be worse than in the summer time," said Yuhang Wang, who co-authored the study with Yuzhong Zhang. "We are likely to have record ozone days in the fall, and we need to prepare for that."


The research isn't conclusive, but it presents enough evidence to raise concerns about the indirect consequences of global warming, said other scientists who weren't involved in the study.


"Climate change is about more than sea ice and polar bears," Laura Rehrmann, a fellow at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, said in an email. "It is also about whether the air will be safe so your children can go play outside."


The climatologists looked deeply into a rare October smog spike in the Southeast in 2010. That was a drought year, with unseasonably high fall temperatures, and smoggier in October than it had been in July, when smog usually peaks.


Discovering what caused that spike was important to public health: A longer season for smog raises health risks for millions of people, especially the elderly and children whose lungs are more vulnerable. Smog also can stunt crops.


It has been known for decades that trees and other plants send more smog-causing emissions into the atmosphere than the pollution humans send directly from tail and factory pipes. This study points to an indirect consequence of the global warming humans have caused.


During hot Southern summers, trees usually have humidity to help them cope. But after the humidity breaks in the fall, they're more vulnerable to hot days, which used to be more rare, they found.


The October 2010 smog spike, seen in bright red and orange splotches on an air pollution map, confused Wang and Zhang at first.


"We used to do all this research focusing on the summer, and this October case was very intriguing because we didn't expect to see the red and oranges in the Southeast, with not nearly as much in the Northeast and in California," Wang said.


Moreover, smog-causing emissions from cars and industry have actually declined in recent decades in the Southeast and elsewhere because of tighter emissions requirements under the Clean Air Act. So why were the region's ozone numbers that month higher than nearly everywhere else in the nation?


They looked at all the sources they could think of, and couldn't find the culprit until they turned to the trees. Trees emit isoprene to protect their leaves during warm, dry weather. Isoprene combines with sunlight to produce smog. Only when they plugged this factor into their computer simulation did the results add up.


Chris Field, director of the Department of Global Ecology at the Carnegie Institution for Science at Stanford University, said the study doesn't prove the cause of the October 2010 smog spike, but it does suggest that climate change threatens air quality in ways few people expected.


"The argument is that climate change affects the trees, the trees release a chemical that may help them cope with harsh conditions, and the chemical produced by the trees leads to an increase in ozone," Field said in an email.


"For me, the most interesting feature of the results is something we see quite often, that the risks of damages from a changing climate often come through indirect mechanisms."

By ALAN SUDERMAN, Associated Press


LAS VEGAS (AP) — Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine called on Donald Trump to release his tax returns and provide details about his companies' debts, assailing the Republican presidential nominee as untrustworthy.


"He's got to start being straight with the American people about this," Kaine said Monday. "We've got to know who Donald Trump is beholden to."


Trump has bucked long-held convention by not releasing his tax returns. The billionaire businessman has financed some of his real estate investments with help from a variety of foreign financial institutions.


The Virginia senator was speaking to the ironworkers' annual convention in Las Vegas, making an appeal to blue-collar workers attracted to Trump's anti-trade agenda. Kaine brought his father, Al Kaine, who owned a union-organized ironworking and welding shop in the Kansas City area.


Tim Kaine and his running mate, Hillary Clinton, are competing against Trump for the support of rank-and-file union members, particularly in Midwest battleground states where wages have stagnated and a decline in manufacturing jobs has hurt workers. Nevada, a political swing state, counts a number of unions for the hotel and other related industries.


Major unions, including the ironworkers, have endorsed Clinton, and the labor vote has long been a key part of the Democratic base. But Trump is aggressively courting union voters, and he's tried to paint Clinton as beholden to Wall Street interests.


Tim Kaine highlighted his family connection to the trades during his speech, noting that he grew up working weekends and summers alongside union ironworkers. Kaine said labor would have two strong allies in the White House if the Clinton-Kaine ticket won.


"You will always have a seat at the table," Kaine said.


He also criticized Trump's resistance to efforts by employees to unionize at the Republican's Las Vegas hotel.


Much of Trump's pitch to labor has centered on international trade. He has repeatedly denounced as "stupid" trade deals that he says hurt U.S. workers, and he's pledged to penalize companies for sending jobs overseas.


Trump has also said that Clinton would implement the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal if she's elected. While Clinton promoted the agreement dozens of times as secretary of state, she has since said she cannot support its current form. Kaine also opposes the TPP, though he voted in 2015 to support so-called fast-track authority allowing the president to negotiate trade deals that Congress can approve or deny but not amend or filibuster.

ABOARD THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER GARIBALDI (AP) — The leaders of Italy, France and Germany vowed Monday to boost joint European security efforts in the wake of Islamic extremist attacks as they made a symbolic bid to relaunch the European Union after Britain's vote to leave.


From the deck of the Italian aircraft carrier Garibaldi, which is spearheading the EU's migrant rescue and anti-smuggling effort, Italian Premier Matteo Renzi, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Holland also promised new economic prospects to young people — albeit without any specific proposals or details.


The three leaders travelled to the sun-soaked island of Ventotene to pay tribute to one of the founding fathers of European unity, Altiero Spinelli, and show common cause going into a bigger EU-wide summit next month in Slovakia.


Spinelli, along with another intellectual confined to Ventotene in the 1940s by Italy's fascist rulers, co-wrote the "Ventotene Manifesto" calling for a federation of European states to counter the nationalism that had led Europe to war. The document is considered the inspiration for European federalism.


Renzi invited his French and German counterparts to the island off Naples to remind Europe of its founding ideals as the EU forges ahead amid a spate of challenges, from slow economic growth to extremist violence, after Britain's vote to leave the bloc.


The three placed three bouquets of blue and yellow flowers — the colors of the European Union — on Spinelli's simple white marble tombstone before meeting for an hour privately aboard the nearby Garibaldi.


"Many people thought that after Brexit, that Europe was finished. It's not like that," Renzi said from the deck. "We respect the choice of Britain's citizens, but we want to write a page for the future."


Renzi, Merkel and Hollande all voiced support for improved internal and external defense measures, including better intelligence-sharing and beefed-up border defenses, following a spate of Islamic extremist attacks in France that have rattled Europeans' sense of security.


Renzi said such measures were an "absolute priority" for the EU going forward.


"Europe should have a framework of protection. For security we need to have borders that can be guarded," Hollande said. "We also want there to be more coordination in the fight against terrorism."


Merkel said the EU is currently facing "enormous challenges" and needed to work together especially on the security front at home and abroad.


"We feel that faced with Islamist terrorism and in light of the civil war in Syria that we need to do more for our internal and external security," she said. "Defense cooperation ... should be strengthened and the exchanges between our intelligence services must be intensified."


The three also called for greater economic stimulus measures to create jobs, especially for young people, and improve investment opportunities.


For Merkel, the visit to Ventotene marked the start of a string of meetings with other EU leaders to discuss the post-Brexit EU, with visits to Estonia, the Czech Republic and Poland in the coming days and meetings with the leaders of Slovakia and Hungary in Warsaw. Merkel has also invited leaders from the Nordic countries, the Netherlands, Austria and other eastern European nations for informal meetings at a government guest house in Germany.


"She wants to support a discussion that is as broad as possible, with as many actors involved as possible," her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said last week. That is aimed at ensuring that whatever emerges from the post-Brexit process "finds the widest possible acceptance in the member states and in the population."


Merkel has shown little enthusiasm for grandiose changes to the EU's structure, preferring to make things work better rather than embark on major structural reform. France, for its part, wants greater EU integration and Hollande is a strong proponent of joining European defense efforts as Italy wants. However the French presidential campaign is getting into full swing and is likely to unleash anti-EU sentiment.


Italy has a lot to gain from a reinvigorated EU as it copes with flat GDP, the migrant crisis and political uncertainties over a constitutional referendum this fall on which Renzi has staked his government's survival.


Monday's mini-summit will serve as a warmup for an EU-wide summit in Bratislava in September designed to chart the EU's post-Brexit way forward. It follows an initial three-way huddle by Renzi, Merkel and Holland in Berlin in the days immediately following the June 23 British referendum.


There, the three leaders pledged their commitment to European unity and plotted a common proposal to relaunch the European project focusing on three key areas: improving security, boosting economic growth and strengthening options and programs for young people.


Charting a course is difficult until Britain formally begins the exit process, probably next year, and lays out proposals for its future relationship with the EU.

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) — Not even tornado sirens could stop a Michigan couple from saying "I do."


As the sirens blared across Grand Rapids, Brandon Warner married Breane Proctor in front of family members and guests at a church.


Despite the storm threat, Warner decided to proceed with Saturday's ceremony.


"Bree is ready and we're all here. Let's go through with this," he told The Grand Rapids Press (http://bit.ly/2bxiZP5 ) for a story Monday. "Let's make it happen. I figured if we were going to get hit, maybe it was meant to be."


"We just kind of shrugged our shoulders and went down the aisle," said Proctor.


After exchanging vows, storm sirens sounded again and everyone stood beneath the church's balconies, away from its stained-glass windows. A little less than an hour after they said "I do," a tornado reportedly touched down less than three miles away, according to the paper.


"The church seemed so big and massive and sturdy," Brandon said. "I truly did not know how bad it was until everyone got on their cellphones and looked at the maps."


After the storm passed, the wedding party rode around to look at some of the storm damage.


Some trees were knocked over and power lines were downed across some parts of southwestern and western Michigan. No injuries were reported.

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey vowed Monday to fight Islamic State militants at home and to "cleanse" the group from its borders after a weekend suicide bombing at a Kurdish wedding, an attack that came amid recent gains by Syrian Kurdish militia forces against the extremists in neighboring Syria.


The bombing Saturday in the southern city of Gaziantep, near the border with Syria, killed at least 54 people — many of them children. Nearly 70 others were wounded in the attack, the deadliest in Turkey this year.


There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but officials said it appeared to be the work of the Islamic State group. Authorities were trying to identify the attacker, who President Recep Tayyip Erdogan initially said was a child. However, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said Monday that it was unclear whether the bomber was "a child or a grown-up."


"A clue has not yet been found concerning the perpetrator," Yildirim told reporters following a weekly Cabinet meeting. He said the earlier assertion that the attacker was child was a "guess" based on witness accounts.


At least 22 of those killed were children younger than 14, according to a Turkish official who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with Turkish government rules.


The attack came after the Syria Democratic Forces, a coalition led by the main Kurdish militia groups in Syria, captured the former IS stronghold of Manbij in northern Syria under the cover of airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition.


"It appears to be an act to punish the PYD," said Nihat Ali Ozcan a security and terrorism expert at the Ankara-based Economic Policy Research Foundation of Turkey, referring to a Syrian Kurdish group whose militia is fighting IS. "It's the cross-border settlement of scores by two actors fighting in Syria."


Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters Monday that Turkey would press ahead with its fight against the Islamic State group inside Turkey and support efforts to remove IS fighters from its borders.


"Our border has to be completely cleansed of Daesh," Cavusoglu said, using an Arabic acronym for the extremists. IS "martyred our ... citizens. It is natural for us to struggle against such an organization both inside and outside of Turkey."


Cavusoglu said Turkey had become a main IS target because of measures it has implemented to stop recruits from crossing into Syria to join the fighting, as well as hundreds of arrests of IS suspects in Turkey.


"Turkey has always been Daesh's primary target, because Turkey has dried out the source of Daesh's supply of foreign fighters. ... It has stopped them from crossing into Syria," he said.


The deadly attack also came amid ongoing struggles between the government and Kurdish militants linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the PKK, and as the country was still reeling from the aftermath of last month's failed coup attempt, which the government has blamed on a U.S.-based Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen, and his followers.


The bombing follows a suspected IS attack in June on Istanbul's main airport that killed 44 people; a double suicide bombing blamed on IS at a peace rally in Turkey's capital, Ankara, in October killed 103 people.


Ozcan, the security expert, said Saturday's attack was likely carried out by a local IS cell whose members would have known the wedding was a Kurdish one and targeted the wedding party for the "shock" value.


The bride and groom, who survived the bombing, urged authorities to act to prevent future bloodshed.


"They turned our best day to hell. We have no relatives left. They all died," said the groom, Nurettin Akdogan. "I hope this will be the last one. Let no one else get hurt."


"From now on, find a solution," added the bride, Besna Akdogan, sobbing.


One of the wedding guests, Nursel Saglam, was on a rooftop overlooking the outdoor celebrations when the bomb went off. When she looked down after the explosion, everyone below was hurt or dead, she said.


"I can't forget that moment," she said, adding that she hasn't been able to return to her house near the scene of the attack and was staying with her sister.


Halil Ilter said he was at home when he heard the blast and rushed to the scene to check on his relatives.


"I cannot recount what I saw," said Ilter, who lost five young cousins. "I am not myself since. There is nothing to say. It was murder."


"My uncle's children died. They were aged 13, 14. One was only 5," he said.

BRUSSELS (AP) — A knife-wielding woman stabbed three people in Brussels on Monday and was later shot by police when she refused to obey their orders, prosecutors said.


Police cars and officers converged on the area near a bus stop where the attack happened in the Uccle neighborhood of the Belgian capital, while a police helicopter flew overhead.


The attacker stabbed and lightly wounded two people on a bus, then fled and stabbed a third person at a nearby shopping center. The reason for the attack remains unclear.


The three victims "were lightly injured and they were all taken to hospital for first (aid) care," said Ine Van Wymersch, spokeswoman for the Brussels prosecutor's office.


"The woman didn't listen to police so they were forced to use their (fire) arm," Van Wymersch said.


Belgium has been on alert since suicide bombings on Brussels' airport and subway killed 32 people on March 22. The attack was claimed by the Islamic State group.


Several crime incidents and hoax calls in recent weeks have seen police deploy in force.


But Van Wymersch said authorities didn't have "any indication" that the stabbing Monday was related to terrorism.


Belgian media said the woman was apparently aged in her 50s and appeared to be mentally unstable.

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Groups representing doctors, consumers and women have asked the state medical board to remove the president of Ohio Right to Life as the board's leader because they say he can't be impartial in abortion-related cases.


In a letter dated Friday, organizations including Common Cause Ohio, Doctors for Health Care Solutions, Democratic Voices of Ohio, the National Organization for Women and the liberal policy group ProgressOhio alleged Mike Gonidakis has a conflict of interest on a pending complaint involving three Ohio abortion providers.


"Mike Gonidakis has two jobs: He is president of Ohio Right to Life, an organization dedicated to ending abortion, and he's president of the Ohio State Medical Board, a panel that received a complaint about three abortion providers," said Sam Gresham, chairman of Common Cause Ohio. "Mr. Gonidakis pronounced the doctors guilty without hearing from them or the patient. His two jobs clearly pose a conflict that he cannot rectify."


Arthur Lavin, co-chairman of Doctors for Health Care Solutions, a group of 600 Cleveland-area doctors working to improve the quality of care, said, "The medical board should be free from politics."


Gonidakis said Monday that he planned to recuse himself from voting on the complaint against Dayton Right to Life cited in the letter. In a statement, he said his decision to sit out the case came before the groups wrote their letter, so as to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.


"Board members are required to discharge their duties in a fair and impartial manner," he said.


Republican Gov. John Kasich appointed Gonidakis to one of two consumer seats on the medical board. He is serving a term that began in October 2012 and ends July 2017. The board's president is elected from among sitting members of the board.

CONCORD, Mass. (AP) — A tornado that briefly touched down in the Massachusetts town of Concord uprooted trees and damaged dozens of houses but spared the family home of author Louisa May Alcott.


The National Weather Service says the EF1 tornado had winds of about 100 mph. EF1 is the second-lowest of six tornado levels. It struck just after 3 a.m. Monday.


Meteorologist Alan Dunham says it caused a swath of damage about a half-mile long.


Fire officials say 39 homes were damaged, including one that suffered significant structural damage.


But Louisa May Alcott's Orchard House was untouched. The historic house and museum's Facebook page says the tornado "hit right above" the home and knocked out power, but the building was unscathed.


The home is where Alcott wrote her 1868 novel, "Little Women."

DENVER (AP) — Is a 12-year-old really in charge of Republican Donald Trump's presidential campaign in Jefferson County, Colorado?


A television report describes Weston Imer (EYE'-mer) as running the field operation in the state's fourth most populated county. The boy's mother, Laurel Imer, is technically in charge but says she's ceded responsibility to her son until school starts.


But Trump's Colorado co-chair, Robert Blaha, says while the campaign likes to have Weston speak at rallies and knock on doors, he's not the campaign office boss.


Says Blaha in an interview: "There's not the possibility a 12-year-old can run an office."


Colorado is traditionally a swing state, but polls show Democrat Hillary Clinton opening a lead over Trump. Clinton and her allies have stopped advertising in Colorado and shifted money to more competitive states.

By JEFF HORWITZ, Associated Press


WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump's paid campaign staffers have declared on their personal social media accounts that Muslims are unfit to be U.S. citizens, ridiculed Mexican accents, called for Secretary of State John Kerry to be hanged and stated their readiness for a possible civil war, according to a review by The Associated Press of their postings.


The AP examined the social media feeds of more than 50 current and former campaign employees who helped propel Trump through the primary elections. The campaign has employed a mix of veteran political operatives and outsiders. Most come across as dedicated, enthusiastic partisans, but at least seven expressed views that were overtly racially charged, supportive of violent actions or broadly hostile to Muslims.


A graphic designer for Trump's advance team approvingly posted video of a black man eating fried chicken and criticizing fellow blacks for ignorance, irresponsibility and having too many children. A Trump field organizer in Virginia declared that Muslims were seeking to impose Sharia law in America and that "those who understand Islam for what it is are gearing up for the fight."


The AP's findings come at a time when Trump is showing new interest in appealing to minority voters, insisting he will be fair in dealing with the 11 million people in the U.S. illegally and explicitly pitching himself to African-Americans, saying "what do you have to lose?"


Since Trump declared his candidacy last summer, he has paid about 120 people on his campaign, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Over the weekend, the campaign reported about 70 people drawing salaries, a number that did not include a few dozen more working as consultants. A slew of hires in early August were not yet reflected in Trump's filings.


The AP was able to review the accounts of only a minority of Trump staffers: Others set their accounts to private, some could not be found or identified with confidence as Trump campaign employees.


The AP also reviewed the public social media accounts of more than three dozen employees of Hillary Clinton's far larger campaign staff and found nothing as inflammatory. One staffer said Trump's style of speaking reminded him of a roommate who had taken too many hallucinogenic mushrooms. AP also reviewed images attached to more than 19,000 stolen internal emails from the Democratic National Committee for racially or religiously inflammatory memes, finding nothing of note.


The Clinton campaign declined to comment on its procedures for vetting staff. It employs more than 650 people, according to its FEC filings.


One month ago, the AP sent written questions to the Trump campaign with examples of the posts. The campaign has not commented, despite several requests since.


Veteran Republican campaign operatives said keeping an eye on staffers' social media postings has long been a standard practice.


"In vetting a prospective staffer, I'm not sure where the line would be for not hiring someone or simply asking them to take something down from social media, but there is a line," said Beth Myers, a former top Mitt Romney campaign aide.


During Myers' work for Mitt Romney in the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, she said, social media was newer, so indiscrete or embarrassing photos were more often concerns than inflammatory views. Even outside social media, she stressed to the campaigns' staffers that what they said and did would reflect on the candidate who employed them. "Don't put anything in an email that you wouldn't want on the front page of The New York Times," she recalled telling staff. "The same thing I told my kids, I told my staffers."


The AP found little questionable content in the ranks of Trump's top officials. The campaign's social media director, Dan Scavino, tweets prolifically but avoids discussing race and religion. Field organizers representing Trump's campaign around the country, however, have had no such reservations, either before or during their employment with the campaign. Their judgment matters beyond the campaign because the paid staff of winning presidential candidates often receives jobs in the next administration.


Before being tapped as statewide director of coalitions, Craig Bachler of Bradenton, Florida, posted jokes in 2015 about Mexican accents superimposed over pictures of an overweight man wearing a sombrero. Bachler was named by the campaign as official staff in November, though there is no record he has been paid for his work. Bachler did not respond to a request for comment via Facebook or a message left at his office voicemail. After AP's inquiries, Bachler blocked access to an AP reporter, and his Facebook account — which included a photo of Bachler with Trump — was scrubbed to remove the offensive post.


Teresa Unrue, a field organizer and graphic designer in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, for Trump's advance team, shared a video on her Facebook account July 11 — the week before the Republican National Convention — of a black man eating fried chicken while shaming fellow black people.


"Why are you mad about slavery?" the man asks. "Y'all weren't no damn slaves."


"Had me crack'n up!! Thank you!" Unrue wrote of the video. "Please share this with people."


In a short phone conversation, Unrue said she tried to keep her personal social media comments positive and referred questions to the campaign.


Some posts fixated on stories of black-on-white violence with claims that news about such crimes was being suppressed.


"How about this little white boy being murdered by a black man," grassroots organizer Annie Marie Delgado of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, wrote in December 2014 post, one of a number highlighting crimes against white people before Trump declared his candidacy. Delgado also shared a discredited, hoax photo of the State Department's Kerry with Jane Fonda, and commented: "I say hang them!" She was paid $11,146 through April, according to campaign records.


Fear or dislike of Muslims was a recurring theme. Though Trump at one point proposed temporarily barring foreign Muslims from entering the country and scrutinizing the activities of mosques, he has sometimes distinguished Islamic extremists who pose a risk and those who don't. "I love the Muslims," Trump said in September, expressing willingness to appoint one to his Cabinet.


On Facebook, Mark Kevin Lloyd of Lynchburg, Virginia, who has been paid $36,000 as Trump's field director in the state, shared a post June 30 calling Islam "a barbaric cult." He shared a meme June 16, four days after the Orlando nightclub shooting by a heavily armed Muslim who professed allegiance to the Islamic State group. The meme said people should be forced to eat bacon before they can purchase firearms.


Lloyd declined to talk to the AP without the Trump campaign's permission, citing his nondisclosure agreement with the campaign.


Other campaign staffers also singled out Muslims for special scrutiny.


Unrue shared the statement, "We need Islam control, not gun control."


During her time with the campaign, Delgado deplored the appointment of a Muslim-American judge in New York.


"Step by step... this is how American culture will end," she wrote Feb. 27, saying it was only reasonable to believe that the judge would implement Sharia law.


Delgado said in a telephone interview she stopped working for the campaign in April. She said she did not recall making some of the posts the AP asked her about and does not stand by others.


"If I read the whole thing, I probably wouldn't have posted it," she said of one post she shared, a short essay declaring that Muslims are inherently incapable of being good Americans.


Phillip Dann, a field organizer in Massachusetts who recently relocated to Florida, was paid $6,153 between January and March. He shared a meme mocking "Muslim sympathizers." He also shared an article about Trump threatening to bring back waterboarding "or worse," and added "where is the gasoline?" Dann told the AP in a phone interview he had no antipathy against Muslims in general.


Dann attributed inflammatory comments of other Trump staffers to the fact that the campaign had drawn on people inexperienced in politics. While he has been politically active for decades — originally as a leftist, he said — he described the field staff Trump acquired in the primary as unfamiliar with traditional campaign rules.


"We get hired because there was no one left," Dann said. In a later email, he acknowledged some of his and other staff postings were "clearly over the top" — but said that criticism of the posts would amount to intimidation.


Scott Barrish, who earned $12,250 as Trump's political director for the Tampa Bay, Florida, region, took his views beyond social media posts. In 2011, he drew local press coverage for writing to the head of the nonprofit Council on American-Islamic Relations, an advocacy group for Muslims in the U.S., saying he was wise to its plans to establish a totalitarian theocracy in the United states.


"This is us vs. you," wrote Barrish. "In the great words of the late President Ronald Reagan, 'I win, you lose!'"


Separately, Barrish tweeted in 2013 that he hoped America wasn't headed for civil war, but "if our freedoms must be defended against a tyrannical government, so be it."


"Those comments at that time were made by me and were my own personal view," Barrish said in a brief interview with AP. He said he stopped working for Trump's campaign after the Florida primary. "I don't want to detract anything from the campaign."


Barrish separately complained to editors at AP about its review of publicly accessible material on Trump employees' social media accounts, saying "the liberal media, yellow journalists are really grasping at straws with their ad hominem circumstantial logical fallacies!"


Many accounts AP reviewed embraced conspiracy theories. Lloyd, the Virginia field director, said Obama is aiding the Iranian nuclear program as part of the president's "'final solution' to the Israel problem," a phrase evoking the Holocaust.


Delgado, the Florida organizer, circulated a theory that the company Edible Arrangements LLC is funneling money to Hamas, a claim that the Anti-Defamation League, a U.S. Jewish organization, has repeatedly dismissed as false.


Unrue posted a link to a website that alleged that the U.S. government assassinated Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died earlier this year after a history of heart trouble.


Racially charged social media posts from Trump campaign employees and associates have already been a repeated source of embarrassment. Trump fired one adviser who had used a racial slur to describe Obama's children, and the campaign denounced Trump's longtime Mar-a-Lago butler for saying he would support dragging Obama from the White House and hanging him.


Katie Packer, a 2012 Romney deputy campaign manager who opposes Trump, said the social media posts AP reviewed would have all been immediate disqualifiers for anyone who had applied for a campaign job — even if the postings weren't visible to the public.


"A comfort level with people who think this is OK is indicative of what you think is OK," Packer said. "Maybe the campaign just doesn't know about this, but that's malpractice."

ISTANBUL (AP) — Turkey on Monday condemned what it said were "disproportionate" Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip, insisting that a recent reconciliation pact doesn't preclude it from speaking out against the country's actions.


Israel responded hours later, calling Turkey's condemnation "baseless" and vowing to defend its civilians.


The Israeli military carried out a series of airstrikes in the Gaza Strip late Sunday, targeting Hamas positions in response to a Palestinian rocket attack that hit an Israeli border town.


"The fact that our ties with Israel have normalized does not mean that we will remain silent in the face of such attacks that target the Palestinian people," the Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement.


"On the contrary, we will continue to (defend) the Palestinian cause," it said, calling Israel's actions "against international laws and especially against consciences."


Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon responded: "The normalization of our relations with Turkey does not mean that we will remain silent in the face of its baseless condemnations."


"Israel will continue to defend its civilians from all rocket fire on our territory, in accordance with international law and our conscience. Turkey should think twice before criticizing the military actions of others," he said.


Turkey and Israel reached an agreement last month to end a six-year rift caused by an Israeli naval raid on a Turkish aid ship trying to breach Israel's blockade of Gaza. Ten Turkish activists were killed in the raid.


Turkey's parliament last week approved the reconciliation agreement under which Israel will pay $20 million in compensation to the victims within 25 days. Under the agreement, individual Israeli nationals also wouldn't be held criminally or financially liable for the incident.


Earlier, police detained five people who tried to break into the Israeli Consulate in Istanbul to protest the Gaza airstrikes.


State-run Anadolu Agency said the five entered a business center housing the consulate early Monday and were detained by police who were called to the scene.


Security around the building was increased, the agency reported.

BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — A Hungarian member of the European Parliament stirred controversy Monday by suggesting that displaying pig heads on a border fence would be an efficient way to scare Muslim migrants from entering the EU-member country.


Gyorgy Schopflin, a member of ruling Hungarian Fidesz party, made that suggestion in response to criticism of local people who have put carved root vegetable, human-face-like masks along the border, believing they would repel migrants.


He said: "Human images are haram (religiously prohibited.) But agree, pig's head would deter more effectively."


Muslims are barred from eating pork because pigs are considered unclean.


Over the weekend, Human Rights Watch director Andrew Stroehlein had written: "Refugees are fleeing war & torture, Hungary. Your root vegetable heads will not deter them."


In a follow-up tweet, Stroehlein said: "Pig heads an ugly idea. Worse is reality of Hungary border abuses with violence against kids."


In comments to Hungarian website mandiner.hu, Schopflin said Monday that the issue was a storm in a teacup.


"I did not humiliate anyone," he said. "When I noted in reaction to a raised question that the pig heads would actually be more effective than masks carved from sugar beets, it was a small thought experiment, nothing else."


The vegetable heads along the border with Serbia have been first reported by Hungarian media last week. There has reportedly been no effort by Hungarian police to remove them.


Human Rights Watch said in a report last month that migrants and refugees at Hungary's border with Serbia were being summarily forced back, in some cases violently. Refugees, including many children, had been beaten with batons, attacked by guard dogs and sprayed by tear gas.


Hungarian officials say their attempts to stop the migrant wave, which reached over 1 million people last year, is intended to defend Europe from mostly Muslims fleeing the war-torn Middle Eastern states.

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — Republican U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk said President Barack Obama was "acting like the drug dealer in chief" when his administration delivered $400 million in cash to Iran contingent on the release of American prisoners — the latest in a string of provocative comments by the Illinois senator caught in a tight re-election race.


Kirk, whose race against Democratic U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth could help determine control of the Senate next year, made the remarks during an editorial board meeting last week with The (Springfield) State Journal-Register.


"We can't have the president of the United States acting like the drug dealer in chief," Kirk told the paper, "giving clean packs of money to a ... state sponsor of terror."


Republicans have criticized the Obama administration after it acknowledged that the repayment of the money from a 1970s Iranian account was connected to a U.S.-Iranian prisoner exchange in January. The administration denies the money was "ransom," saying the Islamic Republic would have soon recouped the money one way or another.


A spokesman for Duckworth, Matt McGrath, said Kirk should apologize.


"Senator Kirk's comments are misguided and deeply offensive, and beneath the dignity of the office he holds," McGrath said in a statement.


Kirk's campaign defended his comments, calling the actions from the Obama administration "reckless in the extreme." In a statement, Kirk spokesman Kevin Artl characterized the transaction with Iran as "more representative of nefarious deals than the conduct of the world's greatest democracy."


Kirk, who is chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on National Security and International Trade and Finance, is planning a hearing to discuss the payment next month, his campaign said.


The Democratic National Committee, meanwhile, called Kirk's remarks "racially tinged" and likened them to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's "hateful rhetoric." Kirk is not endorsing Trump and has called him "bigoted and racist."


"In calling our first African-American president a drug dealer, Mark Kirk has demonstrated that Donald Trump's hateful rhetoric and divisive politics have taken over the entire Republican Party," DNC spokesman TJ Helmstetter said in a statement.


This is not the first time Kirk has found himself on the defensive for something he has said. Last year in June, he said South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, then a presidential hopeful, was a "bro with no ho" because he is unmarried.


"That's what we'd say on (Chicago's) South Side," Kirk said at the time. Kirk later apologized for "inappropriate remarks."


In April of last year, during an interview with the Peoria Journal Star, Kirk said he wanted the government to help black entrepreneurs, spur "a class of African-American billionaires" and make changes "so that the black community is not the one we drive faster through."

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — The nation's largest electric company is negotiating with North Carolina's environment agency over a $6.6 million fine to punish Duke Energy for a big spill of liquefied coal ash.


Attorneys for both sides said delaying Monday's scheduled hearing may help resolve the disputed fine for polluting the Dan River in 2014. Duke Energy Corp. has called the proposed fine disproportionate and arbitrary.


Spokeswomen for the company and the state Department of Environmental Quality declined comment on the scope of the negotiations.


Duke Energy also objected last year when the agency sought an unprecedented $25 million fine for persistent groundwater pollution at the closed Sutton power plant in Wilmington.


The agency later reduced that fine to $7 million and agreed it would cover groundwater contamination at all 14 coal-burning Duke Energy plants in North Carolina. Environmental groups called that a sweetheart deal for the company where Republican Pat McCrory had worked for nearly three decades before running for governor.


McCrory's environmental agency said it was forced to reduce the fine because of a policy adopted under McCrory's Democratic predecessor that favors offenders taking corrective action over paying fines.


Attorneys for Duke Energy — a $57 billion corporation in terms of market capitalization — said DEQ has again exceeded its authority "in an effort to ratchet up the Dan River penalty to a newsworthy amount."


North Carolina officials began pursuing stronger regulations and enforcement of coal ash after a pipe burst at a holding pit at Duke Energy's power plant in Eden in 2014, coating 70 miles of the Dan River in more than 30,000 tons of sludge.


Coal ash — what's left after burning coal for electricity — can contain toxic chemicals including arsenic, chromium and lead.


Duke Energy denies that the 112 million tons of coal ash in its 33 storage pits are polluting water supplies. But it did admit to violations related to the Dan River spill when it pleaded guilty to federal pollution misdemeanors in May 2015 and agreed to pay $102 million in fines and restitution, the state agency said.


The state is proposing daily penalties dating back to January 2012 for these pollution violations. The company says that's improper.


The Dan River spill, the third-largest in U.S. history, pushed North Carolina legislators to force the company to stop storing coal ash in unlined pits by 2029. New U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rules that took effect last year are expected to force similar cleanup at coal ash pits around the country.


The company's challenge of its state Dan River fine is being heard by Administrative Law Judge Phil Berger Jr. He's the son of North Carolina's Senate leader, Republican Phil Berger, who lives in Eden.

Former President Nicolas Sarkozy ended the speculation in France Monday, officially announcing he would seek to win back his old job in 2017. Sarkozy was ousted from power in 2012, after one term, by incumbent President Francis Hollande.


Hollande is now deeply unpopular, but fissures on the right, and France's unique voting system for presidential elections, give the 62-year old Socialist a fighting chance for re-election.


"The next five years will be filled with danger but also with hope," Sarkozy wrote in a statement released on social media. Sarkozy listed the major challenges facing France: defending French identity, restoring lost competitiveness and enforcing state authority.


Sarkozy and Hollande will face off against a number of challengers, most notably Marine Le Pen, the leader of the hardline National Front, whose politics have been compared to those of Brexit champion Nigel Farage and Republican presidential Donald Trump. Hollande could see trouble on the left from fellow Socialist Emmanuel Macron, a youthful former investment banker considering a bid. Alain Juppe, the Bordeaux mayor, is also considered formidable.


The first round will have more than a dozen candidates, with 14 already declared, and more speculated. A second round will occur afterwards, between the top two vote-getters from the first round. The first round will be take place on April 23, 2017. 


Le Pen leads many first round polls. If Le Pen advances, her opponent is expected to appeal toward national unity and moderation, portraying Le Pen as too radical. 


France's election comes after a wave of terrorist attacks in recent years: the July truck attack in Nice that killed 86, the November 2015 Paris attack that killed 130, and the Charlie Hebdo shootings in January 2015 that killed 12. 


"To our shock and compassion, we must now add action, the necessary measures of prevention and control, and the most absolute determination to eradicate the scourge of Islamist fundamentalism," Le Pen said in a statement after the Nice attack. "The war against the scourge of Islamist fundamentalism has not begun; it's now urgent to declare it. We will truly engage in it by implementing a set of measures… which will aim at tackling the roots of the phenomenon."

MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Former President Jimmy Carter said Monday that he thought he had just a few weeks to live during his battle with cancer a year ago.


Carter and his wife Rosalynn spoke at a news conference at a Habitat for Humanity construction project in Memphis. The 91-year-old Carter, a worldwide ambassador for the charity, is being joined by about 1,500 volunteers during a weeklong effort to build 19 homes in a low-income neighborhood near the city's downtown.


Carter revealed in August 2015 that he had been diagnosed with melanoma that spread to his brain. He said in March that he no longer needs cancer treatment.


"Now I feel pretty certain about my cure and the cancer being in remission, but the doctors are still keeping an eye on me," he said.


But during the peak of his fight with the illness, he had his doubts.


"A year ago, I didn't think I was going to live but two or three weeks because they had already removed part of my liver because I had cancer there," Carter said. "After that, when they did an MRI, they found four cancer places in my brain so I thought I just had a few weeks to live."


By last November, Carter was responding to treatment and was able to travel to Memphis for another Habitat for Humanity project.


"By the time I got to here, I was putting on a kind of a false optimistic face," Carter said.


The former president wore blue jeans, a hard hat, a tool belt and a red bandanna around his neck as he hammered nails into the wooden frame of a house he was helping build. The project involves constructing one- and two-story houses.


Moving amid the skeleton framing of the house, Carter appeared energetic and sure-footed as he talked with workers and used a level to make sure wooden beams were properly installed.


Jonathan Reckford, CEO of the Atlanta-based charity, said Carter and his wife have donated their time to help build and improve 3,944 homes in 14 countries.


Carter said he plans to go to Canada to build homes with the charity next year. He still teaches Sunday school classes in his hometown of Plains, Georgia.

By SYLVIE CORBET, Associated Press


PARIS (AP) — France's former conservative president Nicolas Sarkozy announced Monday he is running for the presidency again in next year's elections, an awaited move that is expected to lead to a tough battle with rivals from his own camp.


In an extract of a book released on his Facebook page and Twitter account, Sarkozy wrote: "I have decided to be a candidate to the 2017 presidential election."


"I've felt I had the force to wage this battle at a so tormented time of history," he added.


Sarkozy, 61, is expected to lead a campaign based on hardline ideas on immigration and security in a country marked by recent attacks carried out by Islamist extremists.


The attacks have prompted a national debate about the place of Islam — France's No. 2 religion — in a strictly secular society. With his strategy, Sarkozy hopes to grab some votes from the far-right National Front, whose leader Marine Le Pen has already announced her candidacy for the presidency.


In recent interviews, Sarkozy has said he wants to widen the 2004 ban on the Muslim headscarf in public schools to also include universities. In the name of secularism, he has also said he opposes pork-free options proposed by many school canteens for Muslim and Jewish children, and he has suggested that children born in France to parents staying illegally in the country shouldn't be granted French nationality.


Sarkozy must first win the primaries organized by the French right in November where he's expected to face tough competition.


The former prime minister under Jacques Chirac in the 1990s, Alain Juppe, 71, is the current favorite in the polls. Other contenders from the conservative party include Sarkozy's own former prime minister, Francois Fillon.


Sarkozy lost the presidential election to Socialist Francois Hollande in 2012 after his first term.


When he left the Elysee Palace, he said he was leaving politics and would find a different way to serve his country.


Yet he made a successful comeback in 2014, winning the leadership of the conservative party, known at the time as the UMP. He explained he was moved to return to politics by the "hopelessness, anger and lack of future" that he sensed among the French. Since then the party changed its name to "the Republicans."


Since 2010, Sarkozy's name has been mentioned in several legal cases relating to corruption and influence-peddling, but he has never been convicted of wrongdoing or been sent to trial. Last February he was handed preliminary charges for suspected illegal overspending on his failed 2012 re-election campaign.


The French presidential election will take place in two rounds in April and May next year.


The race remains wide open with primaries to be organized by the left in January. Unpopular Hollande has not said if he will run for re-election.

Despite Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's promises to be the "greatest jobs-producing president that God ever created" and to "jump-start America" and its private sector, he has left a group of business economists from across the country unconvinced.


In fact, the lion's share of more than 400 members of the National Association for Business Economics – 55 percent of them – said in a recent survey that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would more effectively manage the U.S. economy than Trump. Even Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, who's been polling largely in the single digits, garnered more support than Trump did among a group of typically right-leaning business economists.


"This represents American business. And what we found … is that by a margin of 4 to 1, Secretary Clinton was preferred as being the candidate that would be best able to manage the American economy," LaVaughn Henry, economic policy survey chair at the NABE and former vice president and senior regional officer at the Cincinnati branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said Monday in an interview on "Bloomberg Surveillance."


The report isn't particularly flattering for Trump, as more respondents indicated they either "don't know" or have "no opinion" about who would be best for the economy than said they supported the GOP nominee.

But a close examination of responses to other questions in the survey helps explain why Trump's favorability is so meager. Eighty percent of those surveyed said the federal government should "remove restrictions on high-skill immigration." Trump has advocated for increasing such restrictions, though his stance has fluctuated a bit.


Sixty-five percent of respondents also said trade should become "more open and free" under the next administration. Trump has suggested the country is engaged in a trade war and that more restrictive tariffs and policies will level the playing field.


And 56 percent of those surveyed said they either support an unconditional minimum wage increase or an increase with some exemptions for teenage, tipped and short-term workers. Trump has flip-flopped on the issue.


"Business economists are … so pro-trade and pro-immigration, and we're not hearing that in the political ecosphere. What we're hearing is, "No, let's stop immigration. Let's pull back on trade,'" Henry said. "Eighty percent of survey respondents know we need to have higher-skilled immigration come and help our economy. That's the basis of what makes America great – immigration and trade."




RELATED CONTENT







But these are not the building blocks of what would make America great under a hypothetical President Trump, and the NABE is not the first group to suggest business leaders aren't lining up single-file behind the GOP candidate. 


A survey of Fortune 500 CEOs published earlier this year found that 58 percent backed Clinton, compared with Trump's 42 percent tally. And a June analysis conducted by Moody's Analytics predicted that "the economy will be significantly weaker if Mr. Trump's economic proposals are adopted."


It's worth noting, though, that economic analysis has proved difficult over much of the election cycle, given the few specifics the Trump camp had released prior to the candidate's economy-themed speech in Detroit earlier this month. And the sample of respondents from the Fortune 500 pool was small, while the Moody's study was spearheaded by chief economist Mark Zandi, who donated last year to the Clinton campaign. 


Also, Trump isn't getting completely lambasted by those in the business world. A recent small-business owner survey conducted by Manta showed 38.8 percent of those surveyed backed Trump, compared with just 26.7 percent who supported Clinton and 6 percent who backed Johnson.

"Since the primaries, small-business owners' support for Hillary Clinton has risen 8 percentage points. Their support for Donald Trump has wavered little," Manta said in a post on the survey findings.


Small-business owners are often hit particularly hard by rising regulatory costs and the ill effects of free trade, so it's not terribly surprising to see them throw their support behind Trump. But given Clinton's recent efforts to more vocally oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership and advocate for additional public-private partnerships, it's also not a shock to see her poll numbers tick up a few notches.


Still, 62 percent of respondents surveyed by the NABE said uncertainty about the national election is restraining U.S. economic growth in some capacity, with 10 percent indicating the election has dragged on output significantly. 


So the general sense of domestic polarization and heated back-and-forth between Clinton and Trump may prove harmful to the U.S. economy, regardless of who emerges victorious on Election Day.






A recent UNICEF report found that the U.S. ranked 34th on the list of 35 developed countries surveyed on the well-being of children. According to the Pew Institute, children under the age of 18 are the most impoverished age population of Americans, and African-American children are almost four times as likely as white children to be in poverty.


These findings are alarming, not least because they come on the 20th anniversary of President Clinton's promise to "end welfare as we know it" with his signing into law, on Aug. 22, 1996, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (P.L. 104-193).


It is true that the data show the number of families receiving cash assistance fell from 12.3 million in 1996 to current levels of 4.1 million as reported by The New York Times. But it is also true that child poverty rates for black children remain stubbornly high in the U.S.


My research indicates that this didn't happen by chance. In a recent book, I examine social welfare policy developments in the U.S. over a 50-year period from the New Deal to the 1996 reforms. Findings reveal that U.S. welfare policies have, from their very inception, been discriminatory.


Blemished by a History of Discrimination


It was the 1935 Social Security Act, introduced by the Franklin Roosevelt administration, that first committed the U.S. to the safety net philosophy.




RELATED CONTENT







From the beginning, the policy had two tiers that intended to protect families from loss of income.


On one level were the contributory social insurance programs that provided income support to the surviving dependents of workers in the event of their death or incapacitation and Social Security for retired older Americans.


The second tier was made up of means-tested public assistance programs that included what was originally called the "Aid to Dependent Children" program and was subsequently renamed the Aid to Families with Dependent Children in the 1962 Public Welfare Amendments to the SSA under the Kennedy administration.


The optimistic vision of the architects of the ADC program was that it would die "a natural death" with the rising quality of life in the country as a whole, resulting in more families becoming eligible for the work-related social insurance programs.


But this scenario was problematic for black Americans because of pervasive racial discrimination in employment in the decades of the 1930s and 1940s. During these decades, blacks typically worked in menial jobs. Not tied to the formal workforce, they were paid in cash and "off the books," making them ineligible for social insurance programs that called for contributions through payroll taxes from both employers and employees.


Nor did blacks fare much better under ADC during these years.


The ADC was an extension of the state-operated mothers' pension programs, where white widows were the primary beneficiaries. The criteria for eligibility and need were state-determined, so blacks continued to be barred from full participation because the country operated under the "separate but equal" doctrine adopted by the Supreme Court in 1896.


Jim Crow Laws and the separate but equal doctrine resulted in the creation of a two-track service delivery system in both law and custom, one for whites and one for blacks that were anything but equal. 


Developments in the 1950s and '60's further disadvantaged black families.


This happened when states stepped up efforts to reduce ADC enrollment and costs. As I examined in my book, residency requirements were proposed so as to bar blacks migrating from the South to qualify for the program. New York City's "man in the house rule" required welfare workers to make unannounced visits to determine if fathers were living in the home – if evidence of a male presence was found, cases were closed and welfare checks discontinued.


Always an Unpopular Program




RELATED CONTENT







Because of the strong American work ethic, and preference for a "hand up" versus a "hand-out," the means-tested, cash assistance programs for poor families – and especially ADC renamed AFDC – have never been popular among Americans. As FDR himself said in his 1935 State of the Union address to Congress, "the government must and shall quit this business of relief."


As the quality of life did indeed improve for whites, the number of white widows and their children on the AFDC rolls declined. At the same time, the easing of racial discrimination widened eligibility to more blacks, increasing the number of never-married women of color  and their children who were born out of wedlock.


One point, however, to note here is that there has always been a public misconception about race and welfare. It is true that over the years blacks became disproportionately represented. But given that whites constitute a majority of the population, numerically they have always been the largest users of the AFDC program.


The retreat from the safety net philosophy can be dated to the presidencies of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.


On the one hand, politicians wanted to reduce the cost of welfare. Under Reagan policies of New Federalism, social welfare expenditures were capped and responsibility for programs for poor families given back to states.


On the other hand, the demographic shift in the welfare rolls exacerbated the politics around welfare and racialized the debate.


Ronald Reagan's "Welfare Queen" narrative only reinforced existing white stereotypes about blacks:



 "There's a woman in Chicago. She has 80 names, 30 addressees, 12 Social Security cards and is collecting veterans' benefits on four nonexistent deceased husbands. She's got Medicaid, is getting food stamps and welfare under each of her names. Her tax-free cash income alone is over $150,000." 



Reagan's assertions that the homeless were living on the streets by choice played to conventional wisdom about the causes of poverty, blamed poor people for their own misfortune and helped disparage government programs to help the poor.


By the late 1990s efforts of reforms targeting the AFDC program shifted to more nuanced forms of racism with claims that the program encouraged out-of-wedlock births, irresponsible fatherhood and intergenerational dependency.


The political context for the 1996 reforms, then, was fueled by racist undertones that played into public angst about rising taxes and the national debt that were attributed to the high payout of welfare checks to people who were not carrying their own weight.


This emotionally charged environment distorted the poverty debate, and paved the way for a reform bill that many saw as excessively punitive in its harsh treatment of poor families.


Although credited to the Clinton administration, the blueprint for the 1996 welfare reform bill was crafted by a caucus of conservative Republicans led by Newt Gingrich as part of the Contract with America during the 1994 congressional election campaign.


Twice President Clinton vetoed the welfare reform bill sent to him by the GOP-dominated Congress. The third time he signed, creating much controversy, including the resignation of his own adviser on welfare reform, the leading scholar on poverty David Ellwood. 


The new bill replaced the AFDC program with Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF). Stricter work requirements required single mothers to find work within two years of receiving benefits. A five-year lifetime limit was imposed for receiving benefits. To reinforce traditional family values, a core principle of the Republican Party, teenage mothers were to be prohibited benefits, and fathers who were delinquent in child support payments were threatened with imprisonment. States were banned from using federally funded TANF for certain groups of immigrants and restrictions were placed on their eligibility to Medicaid, food stamps and Supplementary Social Security Income (SSI).


Despite many bleak predictions, favorable outcomes were reported on the 10th anniversary of the bill's signing. Welfare rolls had declined. Mothers had moved from welfare to work and children had benefited psychologically from having an employed parent.


However, the volume of research generated at the 10-year benchmark has not been matched, in my observation, by that produced in years leading up to the 20-year anniversary.


More research in particular is needed to understand what is happening with families who have left welfare rolls because of passing the five-year lifetime limit for receiving benefits but have not sustained a foothold in an ever-increasing specialized workforce.


Disentangling Intertwined Effects of Racism and Poverty


U.S. welfare policy is, arguably, as much a reflection of its economic policies as it is of the nation's troublesome history of racism.


In the words of President Obama, racism is a part of America's DNA and history. Similarly, the notion that anyone who is willing to work hard can be rich is just as much a part of that DNA. Both have played an equal role in constraining adequate policy development for poor families and have been especially harmful to poor black families.


Racism has left an indelible mark on American institutions. In particular, it influences how we understand the causes of poverty and how we develop solutions for ending it.


Indeed, with the continual unraveling of the safety net, the 20th anniversary of welfare reforms can be an impetus for taking a closer look at how racism has shaped welfare policy in the U.S. and to what extent it accounts for the persistently high poverty rates for black children.

BEIRUT (AP) — The Latest on developments in the Syrian war (all times local):


Media reports say Turkish artillery has attacked a U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish militia as well as Islamic State group positions across the border in Syria.


Hurriyet newspaper says the attacks targeted positions north of the town of Manbij, which a Kurdish-led force recently captured from IS, on Monday.


The state-run Anadolu Agency says Turkey has increased security measures at its border opposite the Islamic State-held town of Jarablus, deploying tanks and armored personnel carriers.


Turkish officials were not immediately available to confirm the report, which came as Syrian activists claimed that hundreds of Turkish-backed Syrian opposition fighters have gathered in the Turkish border area of Karkamis in preparation for an attack on Jarablus.


Ankara is concerned about the growing power of U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish forces, who are linked to Kurdish groups waging an insurgency in southeastern Turkey.


The U.N. humanitarian chief is urging all combatants in Aleppo to agree to a 48-hour pause to deliver desperately needed aid, warning of a "humanitarian catastrophe unparalleled in the over five years of bloodshed" in Syria.


Stephen O'Brien says Aleppo is being bombed every day, including a dozen new attacks Monday, and has become "the apex of horror" in "the greatest crisis of our time."


He told the U.N. Security Council, which has been deeply divided over Syria, that "you have the power with a pen — a simple pen stroke — to allow food to people."


O'Brien says the U.N. sought to deliver aid to nearly one million Syrians in August but not a single humanitarian convoy has moved so far this month.


London police have arrested two women, aged 16 and 20, for allegedly trying to travel to Syria to join a banned organization.


The Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command said Monday the pair were arrested on suspicion of violating the Terrorism Act. No further details were offered.


The arrest reflects heightened concern about young women trying to join the Islamic State group in Syria.


The issue particularly rose in prominence after three teenage girls traveled to Syria last year to become so-called "jihadi brides." One of the three, Kadiza Sultana, is believed to have died in an airstrike.


The Russian Defense Ministry says all Russian warplanes that were based in Iran, from which they launched airstrikes in Syria, have returned back to Russia.


The ministry said in a statement on Monday that as long as Iran agrees Russia could use the Iranian air base again "depending on the situation" in Syria.


Russia first announced last week that its planes had flown combat missions from Iran, a move that represented a historical rapprochement between Moscow and Tehran.


Moscow's comments came hours after the Iranian Defense Ministry criticized Russia for having "kind of show-off and ungentlemanly" attitude for publicizing the fact that it had used the Iranian base.


A Syrian Kurdish news agency says clashes have erupted again in the northern Syrian city of Hasakeh between Kurdish fighters and Syrian pro-government militias.


Monday's outbreak follows a short lull in violence the day before.


The Hawar News Agency says fighters loyal to the Kurdish political movement are engaged with pro-government fighters in the city. The government and the Kurdish movement have shared control of the city since the early years of the Syrian civil war.


Syrian government planes bombed Kurdish positions in Hasakeh last week as the struggle for predominance in the city escalated. The clashes had calmed Sunday amid news of a possible truce.


The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says Kurdish fighters have advanced into the city's eastern Ghouieran neighborhood amid "violent" clashes.


Iran's foreign ministry spokesman says Russia will stop using an Iranian air base for airstrikes in Syria for the time being.


Bahram Ghasemi told reporters on Monday in Tehran that the Russian airstrikes on militants in Syria were "temporary, based on a Russian request."


He also says the strikes were carried out with "mutual understanding and with Iran's permission" and that the Russian mission "is finished, for now."


Ghasemi reiterated that Russia "has no base in Iran."


His remarks reflect the Iranian authorities' displeasure at the extent of publicity Russia's use of an Iranian air base got last week.


Iran's defense minister is chastising Russia, saying Moscow's announcement on using Iranian bases for attacks on Syrian militants was "kind of show off and ungentlemanly."


State TV's website on Monday quoted Gen. Hossein Dehghan as saying "Russians seek to show that they are a superpower."


Dehghan's remarks were the first sign of pushback from Tehran after Russia last week began using Iranian territory to launch airstrikes in Syria, with Moscow's bombers flying out of the Islamic Republic for three straight days to hit what Russia says are Islamic State targets and other militants in the war-ravaged country.


Iran only confirmed the flights and the use of its bases a day after Russia made the announcement.


Dehghan's comments suggest Iran may not have wanted the flights publicized to such an extent.

In an interview for a segment on "Fox and Friends" on Monday, reporter Ainsley Earhardt informed Mike Pence that Donald Trump says by 2020 he's going to have 95 percent of black America's support.


And Pence, Trump's running mate, giggled.


According to a Fox News poll, as of last week, Trump currently has 1 percent of the black vote nationwide – a far cry from 95 percent. Pence chalked the assertion up to Trump's unfailing ability to be "optimistic."


"His optimistic view about 2020 when he's running for re-election, that's pure Donald Trump," Pence said. "African-Americans in this country see the new jobs, new opportunities, the new educational choices that they will have under a Trump administration. I have no doubt in my mind that that support is going to grow."




BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) — An opposition politician in Azerbaijan has been arrested on charges related to last month's failed coup in Turkey.


A court in Azerbaijan's capital ruled Monday to place Faig Amirov, a leading member of the Popular Front of Azerbaijan opposition party, under arrest for three months on charges of inciting religious hatred.


Police said that Amirov had books by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom the Turkish government has accused of masterminding the July 15 botched coup. Gulen denies involvement.


Amirov's lawyer, Aqil Lahicev, rejected the charges as "absurd," saying that Gulen's books don't contain any propaganda of hatred and haven't been banned in Azerbaijan.


Azerbaijan, a Turkic nation, shares strong ties with Turkey. It has voiced a strong support for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the failed coup.

VENTOTENE, Italy (AP) — The Latest on the meeting of leaders from Italy, France and Germany (all times local):


German Chancellor Angela Merkel says that the European Union is currently facing "enormous challenges" and needs to work together.


Speaking alongside her Italian and French counterparts Monday, she said "we feel that faced with Islamist terrorism and in light of the civil war in Syria that we need to do more for our internal and external security."


Among other things, she said defense cooperation should be strengthened and that intelligence services need to intensify their exchange of information.


She also says European nations need to continue to cooperate in their fight against the smuggling of migrants across the Mediterranean and to protect Europe's external borders.


Merkel says: "more needs to be done for our internal and external security."


French President Francois Hollande is urging Europeans and their leaders against retreating into nationalist tendencies after Britain's vote to leave the European Union.


Hollande said Europe can have a future of "unity and cohesion" but only if EU and national leaders fight against "dislocation, egotism, folding in on ourselves."


He spoke on an aircraft carrier off an Italian island alongside the leaders of Germany and Italy as they plotted a path forward without Britain in the EU.


France is among the European countries seeing a rise in support for nationalist parties amid economic and security concerns.


Italian Premier Matteo Renzi says Europe wants to "write a future chapter" after Britain's vote to leave the EU focusing on common defense, security and economic growth especially addressing youth unemployment.


At the end of a mini-summit Monday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande, Renzi said improved security and intelligence sharing is an "absolute priority" for a Europe confronting Islamic extremist violence.


Hollande stressed in particular the need for common European defense efforts after a string of deadly attacks in France and other European countries.


The three leaders held a press conference aboard the Italian aircraft carrier Garibaldi, which is coordinating the EU's Mediterranean migrant rescue operation, after paying tribute to one of the founding fathers of European unity on the island of Ventotene.


The leaders of Italy, France and Germany have paid their respects at the tomb of one of the founding fathers of European unity in a symbolic bid to relaunch the European project following Britain's decision to leave the EU.


Standing together in the cemetery of the sun-soaked island of Ventotene, Italian Premier Matteo Renzi, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Holland placed three bouquets of blue and yellow flowers — the colors of the European Union — on the simple white marble tombstone of Altiero Spinelli.


Spinelli, along with another intellectual confined to Ventotene in the 1940s by Italy's fascist rulers, co-wrote the "Ventotene Manifesto" calling for a federation of European states to counter the nationalism that had led Europe to war.


The document is considered the inspiration for European federalism.


The leaders of Italy, France and Germany are heading to one of the symbolic birthplaces of European unity to chart the path forward following Britain's decision to leave the EU.


Economic growth, improved security and new job options for European young people are among the topics expected to be discussed.


Italian Premier Matteo Renzi, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Holland start their meeting by paying respects at the tomb of Altiero Spinelli, who in 1941 began co-writing the "Ventotene Manifesto." The document, which called for a federation of European states to counter the nationalism that had led Europe to war, inspired European federalism.


The three then head to another symbolic location for the summit: the Italian aircraft carrier Garibaldi, which is coordinating the EU's migrant rescue operation.

NEW YORK (AP) — Ang Lee's 3-D, high-frame rate drama "Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk" will premiere at the New York Film Festival.


Lincoln Center's Film Society announced the selection Monday, giving a festival landing spot to one of the fall's most distinct releases. Lee also premiered his previous film, the 3-D "Life of Pi," at the New York Film Festival in 2012.


"Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk," adapted from Ben Fountain's novel, is about an American war hero being celebrated on a victory tour at an NFL game. Lee shot it with a 120-frame rate, far faster than the usual 24 frames per second. To mixed reviews, Peter Jackson experimented with a 48-frame rate in "The Hobbit" trilogy.


Lee said the film, told almost entirely from the perspective of Billy (played by newcomer Joe Alwyn), lent itself to the "emotion and intensity" fostered by the new technology.


"With each film, I try to learn fresh ways to connect with the audience and with myself," said Lee in a statement. "Since 'Life of Pi,' I have been working with my team toward a new cinematic approach that I hope will revitalize that connection."


"Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk" will debut Oct. 14 at the festival, ahead of its Nov. 11 release from Sony Pictures.


The 54th New York Film Festival runs Sept. 30 through Oct. 16.

Earlier this month, Massachusetts became the 35th state to pass ride-hailing legislation to regulate so-called transportation network companies like Uber and Lyft. Much of the law is the same standard boilerplate used by other states, but Massachusetts' law has some new and frustrating twists.


Gov. Charlie Baker, who first proposed the legislation, said that it would ensure that Massachusetts remained a leader in innovative new technologies, but the governor and the Massachusetts legislature missed a major opportunity to be truly innovative. The Massachusetts law prohibits local jurisdictions from implementing their own licenses for ride-hailing firms or requiring them to pay fees – but it could have done the same for taxicabs and limos and applied the same regulations to all transportation service providers. 


For example, Fort Worth, Texas and Melbourne, Florida recently enacted laws that more or less apply equally to all for-hire drivers. Instead of following their lead, Massachusetts' law simply offers another carve-out for a specific kind of service provider in the transportation industry, rather than creates a truly level playing field for all transportation services.


Recent research by Chris Koopman, Matt Mitchell and myself at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University illustrates how the same communication innovations that caused a revolution in the transportation industry also offer an opportunity to disrupt and improve archaic taxi laws. Taxi regulations are quite literally the textbook example of how laws can restrict competition and grant monopoly-like power to existing companies. Advocates for the initial, Depression-era taxi regulations argued that limitations on the number of licenses issued and mandated taxi fares were necessary to protect consumer welfare. Over time, however, they proved that they do the exact opposite – restrictions on supply and price controls only help those who own the government-granted privilege to drive a taxi. Regulators should instead start from a completely blank slate and determine what, if any, regulations are actually necessary.


Perhaps the most worrisome aspect of the Massachusetts legislation is the creation of a "Ride For-Hire Task Force" whose purpose is to make recommendations on the regulations affecting taxis, limos and ride-hailing vehicles. Despite the seemingly neutral makeup of the task force members, the long history of taxi regulation, as well as economic research, indicates that special interest groups will convince the members to advocate for even more regulation. Existing companies have a strong incentive to lobby for anti-competitive laws that create barriers to entry for new entrepreneurs and for regulations that raise the operating costs of their rivals. 


In fact, one aspect of the Massachusetts' law represents a perfect example of an attempt to "raise rivals' costs." The law requires ride-hailing companies to pay a $0.20 tax for every ride they provide in the state. Since Boston alone was responsible for over 2 million ride-hailing trips per month last year, this means that the annual cost of this tax will total at least $5 million dollars. To add insult to injury, taxi and limo companies will be provided 25 percent of this tax to fund adoption of new technologies to allow them to compete with ride-hailing companies.


In an impressive sleight of hand, however, the law also mandates that the $0.20 per ride tax cannot be charged to riders or drivers. Such a requirement is economically laughable, since any revenue to pay the tax would have to come from either higher customer prices, lower pay for drivers or reduced service quality. In short, the law essentially requires the ride-hailing companies to print their own money to pay the tax. However, since Massachusetts' law ends at the state's borders, the ride-hailing companies will be able to use revenue from the rest of the country to pay for Massachusetts' tax. So while this law might initially seem like a Massachusetts-specific problem, it affects the rest of the country, too.


This is an example of what economist Mancur Olson termed "concentrated benefits and dispersed costs." Olson was describing the phenomenon of small special interest groups lobbying for government favors and passing the costs on to larger, more dispersed groups. The larger size of the dispersed group and the relatively minor costs they face inhibits their ability to rally support to oppose the legislation, while the smaller group could organize more easily and would gain a larger per-person payoff for doing so. In the case of Massachusetts' law, the dispersed group – the rest of the country – didn't even have the opportunity to fight against being on the hook for the taxi and limo payout.


At best Massachusetts' ride-hailing legislation represents a step sideways, not forward. It could have seized the initiative to be truly innovative and release taxi drivers from the regulatory burdens preventing them from competing with ride-hailing companies on a level playing field. Instead, it perpetuated the same sort of stale regulatory structure that has kept the taxi industry from innovating since the Great Depression. Even worse, Massachusetts stuck the rest of the nation with the bill for appeasing taxi interests. Taxation without representation, indeed.

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — The Latest on the aftermath of the Turkey wedding party attack (all times local):


Turkish officials are backtracking on an earlier statement that the suicide bomber who attacked a wedding ceremony was a child.


The prime minister says authorities are still trying to determine who carried out the attack, which killed at least 54 people , saying authorities didn't know if the perpetrator was a "child or a grown-up."


Speaking after a Cabinet meeting on Monday, Premier Binali Yildirim said "a clue hasn't yet been found concerning the perpetrator of the attack."


President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had announced Sunday that the bomber was aged between 12 and 14.


An official says at least 22 victims of a child suicide bomber who attacked a Kurdish wedding party were children under the age of 14.


The official, who spoke Monday, couldn't be named in line with Turkish government rules.


The attack in Gaziantep, near Turkey's border with Syria on Saturday, killed at least 51 people and wounded nearly 70 other people.


It was the deadliest in Turkey this year.


Officials have said it appears to be the work of the Islamic State group, accusing it of trying to destabilize the country by exploiting ethnic and religious tensions.


Authorities were trying to identify the child attacker, who President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said was aged between 12 and 14.

NEW YORK (AP) — Aretha Franklin is canceling some upcoming concerts to rest up.


The 74-year-old singer said in a statement Monday that "due to doctors' orders I will have to cancel a few concerts for the next month or so," including an Aug. 26 show at the Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts near Vienna, Virginia.


Franklin is canceling two performances at New York City's Radio City Music Hall: She'll skip "Tony Bennett Celebrates 90" on Sept. 15 and a solo show on Sept. 23.


The Queen of Soul said she should be back on the road in November. She canceled a show in Las Vegas last year because of exhaustion.

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli authorities on Monday confirmed that they have begun the process of expanding an Israeli settlement in Hebron, a West Bank city that has been the focus of nearly a year of violence.


The Palestinians swiftly condemned the move, saying they would seek international pressure to halt the plan from going forward.


The Palestinians, along with the international community, oppose all settlement construction in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories they seek for a future independent state. Israel captured both areas in the 1967 Mideast war.


Construction in Hebron, the West Bank's largest city, is especially contentious. About 1,000 Jewish settlers live in heavily fortified enclaves in the city, surrounded by some 200,000 Palestinians. The city is holy to both Jews and Muslims. There is frequent friction between the sides, and the city has been a flashpoint of violence during nearly a year of fighting.


Since last September, Palestinians have killed 34 Israelis in shootings, stabbings and vehicular attacks. At least 206 Palestinians have died by Israeli fire in the same period. Israel says most of the dead were attackers, though the Palestinians have challenged many of the Israeli accounts.


The site in question is next to Beit Romano, one of the settler enclaves inside Hebron. Most recently, it has been used by the Israeli military.


COGAT, the Israeli defense body responsible for civilian affairs in the West Bank, confirmed Monday that permission "to plan infrastructures" has been granted.


Hagit Ofran of the anti-settlement group Peace Now said it was the first approval in the area in more than a decade. She accused Israel of using "legal acrobatics" of allocating the land to settlers, instead of turning it over to the Palestinian-run municipality.


Settlers say they are returning to properties that belonged to Jews before they fled the area following deadly Arab riots in 1929.


Yishai Fleisher, a spokesman for the Jewish community of Hebron, welcomed expanding the settlement, saying it "would be good news for the Jewish community here." However, he said there are no building plans yet.


Although any construction is likely years away, the plan threatened to upset the already-tense climate in Hebron.


Kamel Hmeid, the Palestinian governor of Hebron, called it "one of the most dangerous decisions" by Israel. "What is happening is a cooperation and collusion between the government and the settlers."


The Palestinian Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, issued a statement accusing Israel of trying to "Judaize" Hebron.


It vowed to turn to the Israeli Supreme Court, United Nations and international courts to stop the plan. "We stress the need for immediate action to prevent the implementation of this new settlement plan," it said.


The Israeli steps come at a time of deadlock in international peace efforts. The most recent round of U.S.-mediated talks broke down more than two years ago.


A number of parties, including the U.S., France and European Union, have attempted to restart negotiations. On Monday, both Egypt's president, Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and Palestinian officials said that Russia has also offered to host peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.


Gaps between the sides are so vast that talks appear unlikely anytime soon. Nabil Abu Rdeneh, the spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said Monday that the Palestinian leader is ready to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but only if he meets a series of conditions, including a freeze on settlement construction. The Palestinians say that continued construction on occupied lands is a sign of bad faith by Israel.


Netanyahu's government is dominated by West Bank settlers and their supporters, and Netanyahu is unlikely to agree to halt construction.


Despite the continued deadlock, a new Israeli-Palestinian poll released Monday showed that a narrow majority on both sides still favor a peace settlement that would establish a Palestinian state alongside Israel.


The poll found that 51 percent of Palestinians and 59 percent of Israelis still support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.


Tamar Hermann, an Israeli political scientist who conducted the survey with Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki, said that under the current circumstances, the results were "not amazingly encouraging," but also "not discouraging."


"It showed there is still some basis for optimism with the right leadership," she said.


The survey interviewed 1,270 Palestinians and 1,184 Israelis in June, and had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.

NEW YORK (AP) — "Good Morning America" co-anchor Amy Robach has apologized for saying "colored people" on Monday's broadcast of the ABC program.


Her use of the term sparked criticism on social media. "Offensive," tweeted one viewer. Another said Robach "gets a pass this time" but vowed to ditch "GMA" for a rival morning program if it happened again.


During a segment on diversity in Hollywood, Robach had noted recent criticism for casting white actors "in what one might assume should be a role reserved for colored people."


After the broadcast, Robach released a statement explaining she had meant to say "people of color."


She called the incident "a mistake" and "not at all a reflection of how I feel or speak in my everyday life."

By KEN SWEET, AP Business Writer


NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks are moderately lower in midday trading Monday as the market drifts between small gains and losses. A drop in oil prices pulled energy companies lower. Investors were looking ahead to the Fed's meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for clues on timing for possible interest rate hikes.


KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average lost 44 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,509 as of 12:05 p.m. Eastern. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost five points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,179 and the Nasdaq composite lost nine points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,229.


DRUGMAKER MERGER: Cancer drug maker Medivation jumped $13.24, or 20 percent, to $80.40 after pharmaceutical giant Pfizer announced it would buy the company for $14 billion, or $81.50 a share. Pfizer is buying Medivation for its heavily used prostate cancer drug Xtandi, which generates roughly $2 billion in sales a year.


The Medivation deal pushed other biotechnology stocks higher as well. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Alexion Pharmaceuticals all were up 3 percent or more. Health care and utilities were the only two sectors to rise in the S&P 500 index.


ENERGY WEAKNESS: Oil prices fell sharply. U.S. benchmark crude lost $1.46 to $47.65 a barrel and Brent crude, used to price oil internationally, declined $1.54 to $49.34 a barrel. The drop in energy prices dragged down energy stocks, which lost 1.1 percent, more than the rest of the market.


FED WATCH: Investors were looking ahead to a speech by Fed chair Janet Yellen at an annual summer gathering in Jackson Hole for indications of how policymakers view the outlook for economic growth and interest rates. Analysts expect Yellen to express caution but support the impression the U.S. central bank is on track to raise rates as early as this year.


While investors do not expect the central bank to raise interest rates at its September meeting, there's always the possibility and the increasing likelihood of a rate increase once the presidential election is finished.


ALL QUIET: Trading is likely to be subdued this week, as it has been all month. Second quarter earnings season is effectively over and the next major piece of economic data does not come until Friday, when Yellen will speak. The last time the S&P 500 had a move of 1 percent or more was July 8, when it rose 1.5 percent.


BONDS, CURRENCIES: U.S. government bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.55 percent from 1.58 percent late Friday. The dollar rose to 100.43 yen from 100.24 yen. The euro fell to $1.1312 from $1.1324.

NEW YORK (AP) — Valeant Pharmaceuticals replaced Robert Rosiello as chief financial officer as the embattled company attempts to normalize operations amid a host of investigations and class action lawsuits.


The Canadian company named Paul Herendeen, former Zoetis chief financial officer, to fill the post immediately on Monday.


The news sent shares up by more than 8 percent to $31.14 in midday trading.


Valeant has been under fire for its strategy of buying smaller drug companies, then hiking the prices of the drugs that those companies make.


Earlier this year, the company ousted Michael Pearson, the CEO who engineered the Valeant's acquisition strategy, replacing him with Joseph Papa.


Valeant is the target of at least 11 investigations in the U.S. and Canada, and a number of class action suits. The company's income has been declining drastically for more than a year. In the most recent quarter, revenue tumbled 11.4 percent and losses widened.


It is one of several pharmaceuticals that have come under the spotlight as skyrocketing drug prices become a national talking point ahead of the nation's presidential election.


Former CEO Michael Pearson was summoned before Congress to explain how Valeant, after acquiring other drug companies, jacked up prices of old, off-patent drugs with little competition as much as five times what they had cost for years. Several other companies have done the same, most notably privately held Turing Pharmaceuticals — whose former CEO, Martin Shkreli, gave the pharmaceutical industry a black eye by hiking the price of a life-saving drug called Daraprim by 5,000 percent, to $750 per pill.


Those price hikes do not appear to be abating, however.


The maker of the EpiPen, a device used largely by children to ward off potentially fatal allergic reactions, has surged in recent years, particularly after the recall of its only competitor.


When the autoinjector was acquired by Mylan in 2007, a two-dose package cost less than $60. To the alarm of many parents, schools and doctors, that cost is now closer to $400.


A two-dose package has recently been selling for more than $365, according to data from Elsevier Clinical Solutions' Gold Standard Drug Database.


The backlash against Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. has cost its shareholders, however. The stock plunged with the company's business model in doubt. Shares which hit an all-time high of close to $264 just over a year ago, have since plunged to less than $30.


Prior to Zoetis, Herendeen., the new CFO, logged a combined 16 years in the same position at MedPointe, and then Warner Chilcott.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — In a story Aug. 21 about pills found at Prince's estate after his death, The Associated Press misidentified a synthetic drug found in some pills. It was U-47700, not U-4770.


A corrected version of the story is below:


Official: Pills found at Prince's estate contained fentanyl


An official close to the investigation says some pills taken from Prince's estate in Paisley Park after his death were counterfeit drugs that actually contained the powerful opioid fentanyl


MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Some of the pills taken from Prince's estate in Paisley Park after his death were counterfeit drugs that actually contained fentanyl — a synthetic opioid 50 times more powerful than heroin, an official close to the investigation said Sunday.


The official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation, said nearly two dozen pills found in one Aleve bottle were falsely labeled as "Watson 385." According to Drugs.com, that stamp is used to identify pills containing a mix of acetaminophen and hydrocodone, but the official said at least one of the pills tested positive for fentanyl.


Autopsy results released in June show Prince died April 21 of an accidental fentanyl overdose. The official who spoke to the AP said records show the 57-year-old Prince had no prescription for any controlled substances in the state of Minnesota in the 12 months before he died.


Authorities are still investigating how Prince obtained the drugs.


Fentanyl has been responsible for a surge in overdose deaths in some parts of the country. When made into counterfeit pills, users don't always know they're taking fentanyl, increasing the risk of fatal overdose.


The Star Tribune first reported about the mislabeled pills in a story published on its website late Saturday.


Some of the dozens of pills seized from Paisley Park were found to have other drugs in them, some were oxycodone or codeine, and some were not controlled substances.


About a dozen tablets were found in a dressing room at Paisley Park, but the vast majority was in bottles of aspirin and Vitamin C that had been tucked inside a suitcase and bags — including one Prince often carried with him. Some pills were also found loose in the bag, the official said.


One pill with the "Watson 385" stamp tested positive for fentanyl, lidocaine and another drug. Officials found nearly two dozen pills similar to the one that was tested, the official said.


Another aspirin bottle had more than 60 counterfeit tablets in it.


Some pills that were analyzed contained fentanyl, lidocaine and U-47700 — a synthetic drug that is eight times more powerful than morphine.


Authorities also found a prescription bottle in someone else's name that contained 10 oxycodone pills, the official said, without revealing who was listed on the prescription.


The official said Prince had many of these pills with him on April 15 when the airplane he was on made an emergency stop in Moline, Illinois, after he fell ill from a suspected drug overdose as he was heading home from a performance in Atlanta. Prince was given two doses of Narcan, an antidote used to reverse suspected opioid overdoses, the official said.


U-47700 can be tested for in toxicology screens, but is not done routinely because it is a relatively new chemical. Presence of the drug was not tested in Prince's case, but the levels of fentanyl in his system were more than enough to be toxic, the official said.


Tests on Prince prior to his death did not show fentanyl in his system, which means he wasn't a long-time abuser of that drug, but likely took the fatal dose sometime in the 24 hours before he died, the official said.


The official did not elaborate on those tests. But at least one doctor, Michael Todd Schulenberg, saw Prince on April 7 and again on April 20, the day before he died. According to a search warrant, he told a detective he had ordered tests for Prince and prescribed medications. Schulenberg's attorney, Amy Conners, has said patient-privacy laws do not allow her to say what the prescriptions were.


The autopsy report also shows Prince had diazepam, lidocaine and hydrocodone acids in his body, the official said. Diazepam is an anti-anxiety pill sold as Valium. It's a sedative and can also be used to control seizures, which Prince suffered from as a child. Lidocaine is a local anesthetic.

Police forensic officers investigate the area after an explosion at an apartment block, in Biskopsgarden, Goteborg, south of Sweden, on Monday.  Bjorn Larsson Rosvall/TT News Agency via AP 


HELSINKI (AP) — Swedish police say that an 8-year-old boy was killed in a hand grenade attack at an apartment in the southwestern city of Goteborg early Monday.


Goteborg police spokesman Peter Adlersson says the boy, who died on the way to a hospital, was visiting a family that lived in the third floor apartment when the explosion occurred early Monday. He didn't have details of other possible injuries.


Swedish media speculated that the attack might be linked to a feud between rival gangs in the region, citing police as saying a man convicted of a fatal shooting in the area last year was registered at the address.


Last year, a 4-year-old girl died in a car explosion connected to ongoing gang wars in Sweden's second-largest city.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Former Democratic congresswoman Gabby Giffords is endorsing the re-election bids of Republicans U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, citing their votes on gun control.


Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, made the endorsements in a Monday editorial on behalf of their organization, Americans for Responsible Solutions. Giffords was gravely wounded in a 2011 mass shooting in Arizona.


They cite votes by Toomey and Kirk in 2013 to expand background checks on sales at gun shows and online after the shooting rampage in Newtown, Connecticut.


They say Kirk and Toomey "broke from the gun lobby." Toomey's opponent, Democrat Katie McGinty, says Toomey has hardly strayed from the National Rifle Association's positions.


The battle for Kirk's and Toomey's seats could tip control of the Senate.

Brazilians wrestle with whether a renewed sense of pride is worth the price tag of the Games.


RIO DE JANEIRO — "What's going to be left behind is debt," says Daniel Ferreira Campos. Once a chef, he's frying garlic and chicken in his kitchen and discussing the Olympic Games. As a resident of the Vila Uniao favela in Curicica, he lives 10 minutes away from the Olympic Park but he hasn't seen any events. 


Bad health means Daniel, 72, hasn't been working recently and Brazil's recession is a worry for him. Rio de Janeiro state has debts of billions and that only looks set to increase next year. 


"The Olympics has just been one bad thing after another for me and my family," he says. "The money that it brought in won't be distributed among the population. There are still going to be schools without teachers and hospitals without enough doctors." 




RELATED CONTENT







The Games cost an estimated $12 billion, though that includes some infrastructure that will remain in place. Supporters of the Games say the infrastructure built for the event will imbue new vitality into the city, while critics say the benefits are at best uneven, not filtering into the favelas, the poor communities around the city. 


Daniel lives alongside the new Transolimpica expressway that was built for the Games, but his community saw 300 evictions as a result. Building the expressway caused cracks to appear in the walls of the homes of those who stayed. 


Despite the arrival of the new Metro Line 4 and new roads, traffic remains a daily headache for "cariocas," as Rio's residents are known. Throughout the Games, impromptu holidays were declared to get cars moving, and visitors complained of long, exhausting travel times between venues. A study earlier this year found the city had the fourth-worst traffic in the world. 


Many here have conflicting emotions about the Olympics: fearful of the financial cost while defending Brazil when it has been lampooned internationally over chaotic organization of the Games, booing crowds and threats such as high crime and the Zika virus. When are we going to get a warning about traveling to Miami because of Zika, a Brazilian journalist asked. 


The saga of Ryan Lochte, his U.S. teammates and their invented story of robbery by men dressed as police seemed to crystalize the conflicting emotions for many cariocas. It was one crime that didn't happen, yet it garnered the most headlines. The swimmers' readiness to pin the blame of their own actions on Rio's violence and its much-criticized police force stirred local anger. Many here already believed that the international media was too ready to believe a story that had always sounded fantastical to those who live in Rio. "Do you lie a little or a Lochte?," said one popular meme. "They disrespected us, as if we were nothing, I was very upset," said Rio resident Janne Chipelo. 


For many in Brazil, hosting the Olympics – which by its end was seen to be a success – was about national self-esteem. That feeling was on display beginning with the Opening Ceremony and its emphasis on the country's rich and distinct culture, and continued with the medals won by athletes such as Rafaela Silva, who was born in the favelas and won Brazil's first gold medal in judo.


But the empty seats at most Games were a telling sign that this was a very different beast compared to the carnival festivities that Rio annually hosts. Expensive tickets, including travel on the Metro to arrive at the venues, meant many could not afford to participate in the party they were forced to host. By contrast, free events such as the music shows and big screens at the Olympic Boulevard in the city center were routinely packed. The lower attendance provided a feeling of anti-climax to some sports. At one boxing event, the arena was about two thirds full, but that emptied to almost nothing some time before the medal ceremony, perhaps because no Brazilians were winners.


Those that didn't join the party will still get the hangover. The big spend on sport during hard economic times may mean higher electricity bills for the coming year, as residents learned this week. A revenge victory over Germany for the gold medal in men's football (soccer to North Americans) might seem a distant victory in a short while. 


It's time to face the political realities, too, with a president facing an impeachment trial and an unpopular interim president in charge who was booed at the Opening Ceremony. Protesters calling for him to leave managed to get their signs on display throughout the games. Still other protests during the Olympics focused on security. The Fogo Cruzado (Crossfire) app developed by Amnesty International reported at least 18 deaths by gunfire during the Games, lives lost some distance and a world away from the main venues and the tourist circuit.


The party isn't over just yet. It's now time for the Paralympics, an event which has steadily grown in scale over previous Olympics, and now looks threatened by a diminished budget in Rio. Whether that is a success remains to be seen, but once the cameras have left town it's the people of Rio who will be left with the task of cleaning up.

PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) — Canadian authorities stopped an invasion: 1,500 people on inflatable rafts and boats that drifted across the border from Michigan during high winds on the St. Clair River.


The 7.5-mile Port Huron Float Down is an annual event on the river that divides Michigan from Ontario, Canada. But the winds turned it into an international incident Sunday.


"The event has no official organizer and poses significant and unusual hazards given the fast-moving current, large number of participants, lack of life jackets, and as was the case this year, challenging weather conditions," the Sarnia, Ontario, Police Service said on its website.


Police said it took hours for a bus service, Sarnia Transit, to transport approximately 1,500 U.S. citizens back to Michigan.


"They were unprepared to be stranded anywhere," Staff Sgt. Scott Clarke told the Times Herald (http://bwne.ws/2bc8L3L ).


"It was a bit of a nightmare, but we got through it," he said. "There were long waits and long lines. They were cold and wet, but they all made it home."


The event started at Port Huron's Lighthouse Beach and was supposed to end at Chrysler Beach in Marysville.


Sarnia city workers spent several hours Monday picking up beer cans, coolers, rafts — even picnic tables — that washed up on the Canadian shore, said spokeswoman Katarina Ovens.


"I guess they were on the rafts," she said of the picnic tables.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that the suicide bomber who killed at least 51 at a wedding in southeastern Turkey over the weekend was between 12 and 14 years old.


At least 22 of the dead were children, a Turkish government official said Monday. Erdogan says the Islamic State group is responsible for the attack on a wedding in Gaziantep, approximately 700 miles southeast of Istanbul, near the country's border with war-torn Syria. 


"The initial findings of the governor and our police forces indicate the attack has been perpetrated by [the Islamic State group]," Erdogan said Sunday. "As you know, [the group] is trying to position and organize itself in Gaziantep. Security operations have been conducted and are still being conducted against the terrorist organization."


Like its NATO ally the United States, Turkey is opposed to the Islamic State group, as well as the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad. But the bombing occurred at the wedding of a member of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which wars with the Erdogan government, and has long sought an independent Kurdish state. 


"This attack targets those determined and persistent in peace, resolution, and those struggling for democracy, equality, freedom and justice," the Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party, another pro-Kurdish independence party, said in a statement. "The attack was planned to disable the spread of peace and success of possible negotiations."


The attack also comes a month after a failed coup attempt against Erdogan, the aftermath of which has seen a severe clampdown in Turkish society. Erdogan, in part, blames Fethullah Gulen, an exile who lives in Pennsylvania and who inspires the popular Gulenist movment in Turkey. Erdogan has asked the United States to extradite Gulen back to Turkey.


Vice President Joe Biden is scheduled to travel to the country this week where he is expected, Bloomberg News reports, to strongly back Erdogan publicly. He may also potentially rebuke the Turkish president privately, in reaction to the severity of the government's clampdown, and for fulminating anti-American sentiment. A popular conspiracy theory in Turkey holds that the United States was behind the coup attempt.

By TOM ODULA, Associated Press


NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — East African foreign ministers from countries including South Sudan have agreed to move ahead with the deployment of a regional peacekeeping force to that troubled nation, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday on the first stop of his latest Africa visit.


South Sudan at first rejected the regional protection force after the U.N. Security Council earlier this month voted to deploy the 4,000 additional peacekeepers to help restore calm. Fighting that erupted in the capital last month killed hundreds amid widespread reports of rapes and other abuses and raised fears of a renewed civil war.


There is "absolutely no question" that the force should be deployed, Kerry said after the meeting with foreign ministers. He did not say when the force might be sent into South Sudan.


A spokesman for South Sudan's president, Ateny Wek Ateny, again expressed the belief Monday that the regional protection force violates South Sudan's sovereignty, but he said the country's transitional legislature could decide this week if they will accept its deployment. "The people should decide," he said.


Kerry said the force is "supplementary to the sovereignty and efforts of South Sudan itself, and I think we had a good clearing of the air in the discussions we had."


The secretary of state is in Kenya, East Africa's biggest economy, to discuss regional security and terrorism with regional leaders. He then will visit Nigeria for similar discussions.


Kerry also announced nearly $138 million in humanitarian assistance from the United States to South Sudan, where a humanitarian crisis has worsened amid the recent turmoil.


He added that the U.S., the largest donor in South Sudan, had made it clear that the help has a limit.


He said South Sudan's leaders have been asked to recommit in "word and deed" to the peace accord signed in August 2015 that was meant to end a two-year civil war that cost thousands of lives and displaced more than 2.5 million people. Representatives from South Sudan's government indicated their full willingness to that, Kerry said.


"The leaders of South Sudan have to live up to their responsibilities. They have to put the interests of their citizens first, and they have to refrain from violent and provocative acts," Kerry said.


But the peace deal appears to be unraveling after former rebel leader and vice president Riek Machar, who had been reunited with rival President Salva Kiir under the peace deal, fled amid last month's fighting. A spokesman announced last week that he had crossed into neighboring Congo. His current location is unknown.


On another regional crisis, war-torn Somalia, Kerry said extraordinary progress has been made in stabilizing the Horn of Africa country but much more needs to be done.


He said he and the East African foreign ministers agreed on the need to strengthen Somalia's institutions ahead of elections in September and October. They also agreed to ensure that African Union troops have the needed resources to partner with Somalia against extremists.


Somalia was plunged into chaos in 1991 following the ouster of longtime dictator Siad Barre by warlords who then turned on each other. The homegrown, al-Qaida-linked extremist group al-Shabab continues to launch deadly attacks.

LONDON (AP) — Two tugboats have moved into place to re-float an oil rig that was blown onto a remote Scottish beach in a storm.


The Transocean Winner was being towed when it broke free of its tug and ran aground on the Isle of Lewis off Scotland's west coast on Aug. 8. The salvage team's plan focuses around high water levels expected late Monday.


The rig was grounded with 280 tons of diesel on board. While some of the fuel has been lost, the remaining material on board was transferred from the rig to the supply vessel Olympic Orion over the weekend.


Environmental groups have expressed concern and local politicians have called for an emergency towing vessel to be based in the area after reports it took hours to reach the rig.

Ryan Lochte lost his first major sponsor when Speedo USA announced it is dropping the swimmer over a drunken incident during the Rio Olympics that he initially described as an armed robbery.


As part of the decision, Speedo said Monday it will donate $50,000 of Lochte's fee to Save The Children to benefit needy youngsters in Brazil.


Speedo says that while it had "a winning relationship with Ryan for over a decade and he has been an important member of the Speedo team," it could not condone his behavior after the end of Rio's swimming competition.


At first, Lochte said he and three swimming teammates were robbed after their taxi was pulled over by armed men posing as police. He has since apologized for embellishing his version of events.

HELSINKI (AP) — Police say a heavy concrete block thrown from an overhead bridge onto a major highway in Denmark has killed a German woman and seriously injured her husband as their car passed underneath.


Police spokeswoman Charlotte Nyborg says the couple's 5-year-old son was not physically injured in the attack that occurred at 4 a.m. on Sunday morning.


Nyborg said Monday that a 30-kilogram (66 pound) concrete block tile and several rocks were dropped from the bridge for no "known reason" onto the highway near the central city of Odense as the car passed under the bridge. No one else was injured.


Police were investigating the incident as possible murder.


Nyborg said the family was returning to Germany after holidaying in Norway. She declined to identify them or give further details.

IRBIL, Iraq (AP) — A juvenile would-be suicide bomber was apprehended in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk before he was able to detonate his explosive belt, Iraqi police said Monday.


Local television footage aired on Kurdistan 24 TV shows a group of police officers holding the young boy while two men are seen cutting off a belt of explosives. After they remove the belt, the boy is seen being rushed into a police truck and driven away.


Also Monday, a British contractor working for an American demining firm was killed while defusing an explosive device in the western Iraqi city of Ramadi. The firm, Janus Global Operations, announced the death Monday without providing further details. The British Embassy in Baghdad and the Anbar Provincial Council also confirmed the incident.


The demining firm began operations in Ramadi in April, after Iraqi forces liberated the city from the Islamic State group, which left behind thousands of explosive devices. Dozens of Iraqi civilians have been killed by explosions while trying to return to their homes in the city, much of which was destroyed in the fighting.


The would-be boy bomber in Kirkuk was apprehended on Sunday night, less than an hour after a suicide bomb attack on a Shiite mosque in the city, Kirkuk police department spokesman Col. Avrasiya Kamil Wais told The Associated Press. In the mosque attack, only the bomber died and two people were wounded.


"The boy claimed during interrogation that he had been kidnapped by masked men who put the explosives on him and sent him to the area," said Kirkuk intelligence official Brig. Chato Fadhil Humadi.


The boy, Humadi added, was displaced from the Islamic State-held city of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, by recent military operations in the area. He arrived in Kirkuk a week ago, Humadi said. The boy's name is known to the police, but the AP does not identify minors who may be victims of abuse or suspected in violent crimes.


Islamic State group's media arm, the Aamaq news agency, on Monday claimed responsibility for the mosque bombing, but made no statement about the boy.


Kirkuk, an oil rich city in Iraq's north is claimed by both Iraq's central government and the country's Kurdish region.


Kirkuk has seen a rise in ethnic tensions following the Islamic State group's blitz across northern and western Iraq in 2014. Iraqi security forces largely withdrew from Kirkuk and Kurdish forces known as the peshmerga took control of the city. Since then, Shiite militia fighters have also massed around the city.


The area is home to Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen who all have competing territorial claims. The Kurds have long wanted to incorporate the city into their semi-autonomous region, but Iraq's central government opposes this.

BENGHAZI, Libya (AP) — Libya's parliament voted "no confidence" in a U.N.-backed government on Monday in a major blow to international efforts to bring unity to the deeply divided North African country.


The vote could severely undermine the fledgling government, which Western nations see as the best hope for combatting a potent Islamic State affiliate and curbing human trafficking. Libyan forces allied with the government have driven IS out of much of its former bastion in the coastal city of Sirte with the aid of U.S. airstrikes.


Parliamentary spokesman Abdullah Ablahig said 61 lawmakers voted against the government, 39 abstained and one voted to support it, with enough members — 101 — to reach quorum. The overdue vote by the parliament, which had not convened in eight months, drew criticism from pro-government lawmakers, who said they were not told about the vote beforehand.


"This is cheating," said pro-government lawmaker Galal Saleh, adding that parliament had not announced the confidence vote on Monday's agenda. He said the pro-government bloc was invited to meet with opponents for a consultation, not a vote. The parliament convenes in Libya's far east, while the U.N.-backed government is based in Tripoli.


It's unclear what happens next.


Ablahig said some lawmakers believed the vote would automatically dissolve the government, set up under a U.N. peace deal, and force the designated prime minister to present a new, smaller Cabinet. Others believe the vote requires the revamping of the entire Western-backed presidency council led by Fayez Serraj, which would take the political process back to square one.


Libya has been mired in conflict since the 2011 uprising that toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. The country is been split between rival parliaments and governments, based in Tripoli and the east, each backed by an array of militias and tribes.


In December, the United Nations struck a deal with the rival factions to create a unity government led by Serraj, who is based in the capital.


Lawmaker Abdel-Salam Nassiya said the Cabinet would now have to be changed to include more representation from Libya's east.


The security and power vacuum has transformed Libya into a major conduit for human trafficking to Europe and contributed to the rise of Islamic militant groups, including a powerful Islamic State affiliate. Western nations want a national unity government that can address both issues, and are pinning their hopes on Serraj.


IS seized Gadhafi's hometown of Sirte in 2015, raising fears that Libya could provide a launch pad for attacks on Europe, just across the Mediterranean Sea.


Libyan pro-government forces launched an operation to retake Sirte in June, but the advance stalled once they entered the city. At the government's request, U.S. warplanes carried out a series of strikes on IS positions that helped break the stalemate. Libyan officials now say IS has been driven out of most of the city.

MOSCOW (AP) — Ukraine's General Prosecutor's Office has launched a criminal investigation of 20 senior Russian officials, including the Russian defense minister.


Ukraine's Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko said Monday they are suspected of involvement in crimes against Ukraine's national security. He said Ukrainian authorities plan to seek international warrants for their arrests.


The list includes Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and two of his deputies, Kremlin economic adviser Sergei Glazyev, a former presidential envoy to Crimea, and other top officials.


Russia and Ukraine have been in a tug-of-war since Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in March 2014 and backed a pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Tensions have spiked after Russia said that it had busted a group of Ukrainian saboteurs in Crimea, a claim Ukraine has denied.

LITCHFIELD, Minn. (AP) — A man has been jailed on suspicion of first-degree murder and kidnapping in the death of a co-worker's 5-year-old daughter whose mother says was taken from their home in central Minnesota.


Zachary Todd Anderson, 26, of Monticello, was being held in the Crow Wing County Jail in the death of Alayna Ertl.


Alayna was last seen around 2 a.m. Saturday when she was put to bed at her home in Watkins, about 70 miles northwest of Minneapolis. Her mother reported her missing at 8 a.m. and her body was found later Saturday in a wooded area about 80 miles to the north.


Also missing from the home Saturday morning was Anderson, who authorities said had been spending the night with the Ertl family. A pickup truck belonging to the girl's father was also gone.


"Our suspect in this case is a family friend, co-worker of the victim's father, and was staying the night up in Watkins last night," Meeker County Sheriff Brian Cruze said Saturday night. "He had previously been to that residence and spent a night here and there — so he's not a stranger and not new to the residence, but was just there for the night."


Alayna's disappearance led authorities to issue an Amber Alert.


Sheriff's deputies found the stolen truck on property owned by Anderson's family in rural Cass County, according to a statement from the Minnesota Department of Public Safety. K-9 officers searching the property found Anderson just before 4:30 p.m. Saturday. He did not attempt to flee, did not have a weapon and did not resist arrest, according to the statement.


"Information provided by the suspect" and other "investigative efforts" led officials to Alayna's remains in a wooded, swampy area a few hundred yards from the Anderson family cabin, the statement said. She was pronounced dead at the scene.


A medical examiner said Alayna died of homicidal violence, according to the statement, which gave no further details about the cause of death.


Online court records available Saturday listed only minor traffic violations for Anderson, and it wasn't immediately clear if he had a lawyer who could comment on his behalf. He has not been charged.


"We have no known predatory sexual offender information on him or anything like that," Cruze said. "We have no known motive. We are at a loss as to why this happened at this time."

KIEV, Ukraine, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Ukrainian prosecutors have filed criminal charges against nearly two dozen top Russian government officials, alleging "grave" offenses committed against the nation's national security and citizens' well-being.
During a news conference Monday, Ukraine Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko accused Moscow of numerous charges as both sides continue the military and political tensions that have persisted for more than two years.
""Based on evidence collected the Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine on August 8 notified the individuals that they are suspected of committing serious crimes against the national security of Ukraine, endangering public safety, peace and breaking international laws," Lutsenko said.
"Top elected officials and officers belonging to the Russian Federation Armed Forces are on the list," he continued, "which includes a Russian presidential advisor, the former authorized representative of the Russian president in the so-called Crimean Federal District, the Russian Defense Minister and his two deputies, along with ten generals from the high command of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation."
The charges are connected to Russia's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014, which has been followed by serious conflict between the nations.
Lutsenko encouraged the charged officials to turn themselves in to testify in the case.
Officials said the Russian officials will soon be placed on an international wanted list, due to the purported violations of international law.
The Russian government did not immediately respond to the charges, which Ukraine officials said were levied against the accused officers earlier this month.


ANKARA, Turkey, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- The suicide bomber who killed at least 54 people at a wedding might not have been a child, Turkey's prime minister said Monday.
On Sunday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the attack on Saturday night in Gaziantep was carried out by a bomber between the ages of 12 and 14.
But one day later, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said after a weekly Cabinet meeting "a clue hasn't yet been found concerning the perpetrator of the attack."
He said authorities were still trying to determine whether it was carried out by "a child or a grown-up."
There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Erdogan blamed the Islamic State.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, in a speech Monday, said the Islamic State should be "completely cleansed" from Syria's border area with Turkey.
"ISIS martyred our ... citizens. It is natural for us to struggle against such an organization both inside and outside of Turkey," he said.
Of the 54 victims, 29 were under the age of 18, the Haberturk newspaper reported. Sixty-six people are still in hospital.
The wedding took place in a mainly Kurdish-inhabited neighborhood of Gaziantep about 60 miles north of the war-torn Syrian city of Aleppo.
A written statement by the Gaziantep Chief Prosecutor's Office on Sunday said that police found pieces of a suicide vest in the area where the blast took place.


SEOUL, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- A North Korean defector who died in a work-related accident left behind a diary that sheds light on his personal struggles as a newcomer to South Korean society.
The defector, who was unidentified, fell to his death on Aug. 13 while cleaning windows located on the second floor of a building in Incheon, Yonhap reported.
In his notes, the 48-year-old man reflected on the obstacles he faced in his new life in South Korea.
"I do not wish to be carried away by the waves of a results-oriented way of life [in South Korea] and a world where winner takes all...where expediency is tolerated," the defector had written in one diary entry.
According to North Korean friends and family in the South who knew him, the defector was the head of parking management in the building where he worked, but was demoted to cleaning services in April due to corporate restructuring.
The parent company of the defector's employer is POSCO, one of South Korea's largest conglomerates, according to the report.
The defector's brother-in-law, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said other colleagues were not demoted but that his brother-in-law was the target of discrimination.
The defector was an accredited physician in North Korea but left with his family because his wife suffered from a liver disease.
The family resettled in South Korea in 2006, and his wife was able to receive the medical treatment she needed, according to the report.
News of the defector's tragic death comes at a time when more North Korean defectors are leaving for different reasons than they did during the famine-stricken past, according to data from Seoul's unification ministry.
The ministry stated Sunday defectors now leave because they are "dissatisfied with the North Korean regime" or "long to live in a free society," Newsis reported.
More North Koreans who identify themselves as middle class are resettling in the South, according to the ministry, and fewer respondents say they left solely because of economic difficulties.


SEOUL, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- South Korean President Park Geun-hye suggested regime change in North Korea is close at hand, the same day Pyongyang condemned the commencement of large-scale joint military exercises.
Speaking during a national security council meeting for the Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises, Park said "serious cracks" are emerging in the Pyongyang government, and the possibility the system would be "shaken" is increasing, Yonhap reported.
The president's remarks come a week after she described unification as an opportunity for "all North Koreans and North Korean officials," during a speech marking the 71st anniversary of Korean independence from Japanese colonial rule.
Park did not include Kim Jong Un in her speech, a move that is aiming to isolate the top leadership, according to a South Korean analyst.
On Monday Park said, "Even the North Korean elite class is recently showing signs of collapse, and some of North Korea's key officials are defecting or seeking asylum abroad, signs that there is a possibility the system is shaking."
A South Korean official who spoke to Yonhap on the condition of anonymity said the president is looking at the bigger picture, which includes difficulties for the regime under international sanctions, increasing public opposition to Pyongyang's mass mobilization movements and the defection of elites.
North Korea, however, has shown no signs of giving up its universally condemned nuclear weapons program.
The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed North Korea resumed plutonium production in 2016, a move Seoul condemned on Monday, according to News 1.
Pyongyang has also not stopped denouncing the joint military exercises that began on Monday.
A spokesman for the Korean People's Army said the North is ready to make "preemptive retaliatory strikes" against the United States and South Korea because of the drills.
North Korea has made similar statements in the past, but according to research from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the joint drills do not provoke North Korea. Rather it is the state of diplomatic relations between Washington and Pyongyang that play a role in the North Korean reaction, according to the study.


SEOUL, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- A senior North Korean official in charge of Kim Jong Un's slush fund Room 39 may have defected from an undisclosed location in Europe.
The official, who goes by the pseudonym Kim Myong Chol, may be deciding between fleeing to the United States and South Korea, local news service No Cut News reported Monday.
It is the second recent high-profile defection, after Thae Yong Ho, deputy envoy to London, defected to South Korea last week.
Kim was reportedly under tremendous pressure to earn foreign currency for the cash-strapped regime. When he recently was unable to meet a state-mandated benchmark, one of his family members died while in custody, according to multiple South Korean press reports.
A source who spoke on the condition of anonymity to No Cut News said Kim recently fled taking with him a "large sum of money" that was under his supervision.
For the escaped official, the United States and South Korea present unique disadvantages as asylum destinations. According to the source, Kim's assets would be seized in compliance with U.S. regulations. But in South Korea his personal safety may be an issue due to its proximity to the North.
Kim maintained numerous bank accounts under different names in order to complete complex transactions for the North Korean regime, South Korean newspaper Donga Ilbo reported Monday.
One of the accounts was under the name of a fictitious Indian national. Sometimes Kim would send a lawyer with the power of attorney to remit funds from an account under a borrowed name, to another account, where he would then withdraw the money in cooperation with a bank branch manager.
Kim took advantage of loopholes at small banks in Europe to complete transactions, according to the report.
Room 39, a branch of the North Korean regime that handles the country's illicit financial activities, is under Kim Jong Un's direct supervision.
Income from the jointly operated Kaesong Industrial Complex, shut down in February, was also funneled to the slush fund, according to South Korean magazine Sisa Journal.


BAGHDAD, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Kurdish authorities said the Peshmerga will follow previous agreements related to Mosul made with the Iraqi government and the U.S.-led anti-Islamic State international coalition.
In a statement, Kurdish officials called for a political deal with the Iraqi government and the coalition over the city of Mosul and the province of Nineveh after the Islamic State is defeated.
The statement comes after Kurds said last week they would reject the Iraqi government's call for the Peshmerga to stop advancing towards the city of Mosul, where Iraqi government forces have been battling the Islamic State. The statement calls for a deal that would seek to prevent violence against ethnic and religious communities in Nineveh.
"The Kurdistan region remains committed to the previous agreements between the region, the government of Iraq and the coalition forces, in addition to any other future agreement between those three parties," the statement said. "There ought to be a political agreement among the parties in regard to the administration of the city of Mosul and the Nineveh province."
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi urged the Peshmerga to stop their advancement in Nineveh amid accusations the Kurdish forces are attempting to seize land under the pretext of defeating the Islamic State with the goal of later declaring independence.
Iraqi Security Forces launched an offensive to retake the city of Mosul from the Islamic State in March, supported by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes. Mosul is considered one of the most important battles in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq. U.S. President Barack Obama said he expects the city of Mosul to be retaken by the Iraqi government by the end of the year.


MANILA, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Legislators in the Philippines began an investigation into the killing of more than 1,700 suspected drug dealers and users since President Rodrigo Duterte took office seven weeks ago.
Philippine National Police Chief Ronald Dela Rosa told senators that 712 drug traffickers and users were killed since July 1 and that another 1,067 drug-related killings were being investigated, De.
The Senate human rights committee investigating the killings is headed by Sen. Leila De Lima, who has been accused by Duterte of illegal drug links.
"I am disturbed that we have killings left and right as breakfast every morning," De Lima said.
"My concern does not only revolve around the growing tally of killings reported by the police. What is particularly worrisome is that the campaign against drugs seems to be an excuse for some law enforcers and other elements like vigilantes to commit murder with impunity."
An advisory from De Lima's office said, "The committee will hear and receive testimonies from witnesses of extrajudicial killings and summary executions, reports of concerned government agencies on the spate of killings, position papers of resource persons, look into results of investigations of concerned agencies, and come up with initial conclusions and observations for legislative remedy."
Sen. Panfilo Lacson, a former national police chief who chairs the Senate's committee on public order and dangerous drugs, says he wants to focus on drugs.
"I'd like to pick the brain of the police on the way forward, that is, the end state they have in mind, say, after six months of fighting illegal drugs, their way," Lacson said.
Dela Rosa told senators at the hearing that the country has 3.7 million drug users and that the drug problem persists despite government's efforts.
Since July 1, police have arrested 10,153 "drug pushers and users" in a "double-barrel" policy aimed at high-level criminals and street-level drug users, Dela Rose said.
More than 600,000 people have surrendered to police, he said.
Dela Rosa said if a policeman violates the law, even in self defense, "he will be investigated, prosecuted and accordingly punished."
"The war on drugs should not be reduced to killings," Sen. Risa Hontiveros said. "We cannot play gods and decide whose lives matter and whose lives don't. We must shift the focus in this war on drugs from vendetta to real justice, from shortcuts to reforms, from punishment to treatment."
On Sunday, Duterte blasted the United Nations for criticizing the number of deaths.
In a late-night news conference, he said the Philippines might leave the United Nations and invite China and others to form a new global forum.
Foreign minister Perfecto Yasay said on Monday the Philippines would remain a U.N. member.
"We are committed to the U.N. despite our numerous frustrations and disappointments with the international agency," Yasay told a news conference.


SHAWA , Nigeria, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Members of the Islamist insurgent group Boko Haram destroyed the Nigerian village of Shawa, injuring residents and burning buildings, witnesses said.
An eyewitness and member of a youth vigilance group told the Nigerian newspaper The Punch that at least 20 heavily armed Boko Haram members arrived in Shawa on bicycles early Sunday morning, while residents were asleep, and shot at homes. The villagers fled into a nearby forest and watched as the invaders set fire to all the village's structures before leaving.
The village is near Chibok, where 267 girls were kidnapped by Boko Haram from a school in 2014.
There were no deaths reported in Sunday's attack, but many were reported injured, some critically, and the village remains deserted.
The Islamic State-aligned Boko Haram has waged a guerrilla-style war of terrorism in Nigeria and surrounding countries since 2002, killing thousands and displacing hundreds of thousands in an attempt to establish a Muslim caliphate.


MEXICO CITY, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Mexican media outlets report JesÃºs Alfredo GuzmÃ¡n Salazar, drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" GuzmÃ¡n's 29-year-old son, and five others abducted from Puerto Vallarta have been freed, but Mexican authorities have not yet confirmed it.
Mexican news organizations RioDoce and ElBlogDelNarco report the drug kingpin's sons and five others kidnapped last Monday from the upscale La Leche restaurant in the Pacific coast city were released -- citing anonymous sources who said the six were not harmed.
Officials suspect the Jalisco New Generation cartel, battling Guzman's Sinaloa Cartel for dominance of the drug trade, may be responsible for the kidnapping.
"We should forget the past, appreciate what remains and wait for what comes," JesÃºs Alfredo GuzmÃ¡n wrote on his Twitter account Sunday.
ElBlogDelNarco released a video of the kidnapping at the La Leche restaurant, showing several men with automatic rifles running into the dining room of the restaurant, and the party of about a dozen people, most of them seated at a long table, ducking for cover.



SEOUL, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- China's trade with North Korea appears to have resumed active levels at least since the joint U.S.-South Korea decision to deploy the anti-missile defense system THAAD was announced in July.
Lee Jong-seok, a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute, said Monday trade has been very vigorous, according to local news service CBS No Cut News.
Lee, who monitored activity at the China-North Korea border, said after trade experienced a brief decline in April and May, activity "rebounded" despite the requirements of the United Nations Security Council sanctions and a plunge in prices of North Korean minerals.
After the July THAAD announcement the volume of trade between the two countries has been rising. The Chinese city of Dandong is also getting ready for a "full-scale" launch of activity, including border tourism, by September, trade officials at the border said.
The flow of North Korean laborers into China has also increased, signaling the commitment of local Chinese authorities and businesses to employing North Korean labor for economic development, according to the report.
China is short on workers in "labor-intensive industries" and needs to retain more skilled workers in its IT industry, according to Lee.
There are estimated to be 30,000 North Korean laborers in Dandong alone.
The Chinese city of Tumen employs 20,000 North Koreans and about 4,000 North Koreans are working at 20 businesses specializing in shipbuilding and construction, Lee said.
China may also be providing the North Korean border with a fresh flow of electric power.
Nearly all residences in the North Korean border city of Hyesan appeared to be keeping their lights on late at night, and new homes were being built at unprecedented rates at the border.
China, meanwhile, appears to be scaling back South Korea-related activities, according to Seoul.
The Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency released a report showing multiple cancellations and delays being initiated from the Chinese side in July and early August, local magazine Sisa Journal reported Monday.


TEHRAN, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- The Russian use of an Iranian airbase to launch airstrikes on targets in Syria has ended, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman said Monday.
Use of the airbase near Hamedan, Iran, began a week ago, but the mission is complete, spokesman Bharam Ghasemi noted. He said Russia could seek Iranian consent to use the airbase again, but that no Russian troops were stationed within Iran, except for the airbase.
"It was a particular operation. They came, they went and they finished it," Ghasemi said.
Iranian Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Hossein Dehqan said Saturday the Hamedan airbase was used to refuel Russian planes or reload them with armaments and that Russia can continue using only that Iranian airbase.
Russian long-range and tactical bombers began airstrikes from the Hamedan base on Aug. 16, striking Islamic state targets in Syria. The missions, in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government in the five-year-old sectarian war, continued for several days.
The use of the airbase was seen as strengthening military ties between Russia and Iran, which are both allied with the Assad government.


SIRTE, Libya, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- The Islamic State is losing further control of the Libyan city of Sirte as pro-government, U.S.-backed militias said they captured the town's main mosque and a prison.
The Al-Bunyan Al-Marsoos militia group on Sunday said its forces advanced into two residential areas that held some of the last key hideouts of the Islamic State in Sirte. The militias' offensive against the Islamic State in Sirte began in June, backed by U.S. airstrikes since Aug. 1 after weeks of stalemates.
Positions captured on Sunday after morning airstrikes include the al-Ribatt mosque, the Sahara Bank and the former Internal Security Agency, which was used as a morality prison by the Islamic State, also identified as Daesh, ISIS and ISIL.
Sirte was the Islamic State's stronghold in Libya but its dominance in the city has decreased since the militia's efforts began in June -- particularly after U.S. airstrikes were introduced. On Aug. 10, militias said they seized the last IS headquarters -- the heavily fortified Ouagadougou Center. The militias then worked to hunt down scattered Islamic State militants hiding in Sirte's residential neighborhoods.


ISTANBUL, Turkey, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- More than 200 Turks protested peacefully in the streets of Istanbul on Sunday after the murder of well-known transgender woman, Hande Kader.
The body of Kader, 23, an LGBT activist and sex worker, was found burned in a forest Aug. 8 after she went missing in July. Kader's murder drew enough attention that even a few MPs attended the protest, a rare show of support for LGBT rights in the conservative country.
Kader became famous after putting herself in front of riot police and water cannons during a gay pride parade in Istanbul in June.
She was last seen getting in the car of a client in Istanbul in late July, the Turkish newspaper Sabah has reported.
Police have not announced a motive or made any arrests in the case.


SINGAPORE, Aug. 21 (UPI) -- Two hours into a speech at a National Day Rally, Singapore's prime minister suddenly stopped speaking and slouched over his lectern, giving leaders and listeners a scare.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong fainted during a televised national address, disappearing for nearly 90 minutes before returning to finish the speech and tell the country he was fine but would be having a full medical exam afterward.
Lee, who has been in power since 2004, had been speaking for more than two hours in several languages when he suddenly stopped and physically stumbled before being helped off stage. After being checked out by doctors, he returned to finish the event.
"Thank you for waiting for me. I gave everybody a scare," Lee told listeners, explaining he'd fainted due to dehydration but that doctors were not overly concerned, according to the Hindustan Times. "I think that's what happened. I've never had so many doctors look at me all at once -- they think I'm alright. But anyway, I'm going to have a full check-up after this."
Lee was treated early last year for prostate cancer, and was treated and cleared of lymphoma about 20 years ago, however aides blamed the episode on fatigue and dehydration, and that doctors ruled out that he had a stroke.
The prime minister continued his speech, which the Sydney Morning Herald reports was focused on succession of leadership in the country and its importance. Using the scare to make his point, Lee said planning for the next transition of Singapore's government should start now, considering an election is planned for sometime by early 2021.
"Soon after the next general election my successor must be ready to take over," Lee said. "What just happened makes it even more important that I talk about it now."


WASHINGTON, Aug. 21 (UPI) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will travel to Kenya, Nigeria and Saudia Arabia to meet with leaders in the nations, including talks on countering terrorism.
Kerry first meets with Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday in Nairobi "to discuss regional security issues and counterterrorism cooperation, as well as bilateral issues," according to a release from the U.S. Department of State. This includes unrest in neighboring South Sudan and security in Somalia,
Kerry will also meet with Kenyan Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed and other regional foreign ministers to discuss issues.
Kerry then will be in Sokoto, and Abuja, Nigeria, on Tuesday and Wednesday. He will meet with President Muhammadu Buhari to discuss "counterterrorism efforts, the Nigerian economy, the fight against corruption, and human rights issues," according to the release.
Kerry then travels to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to meet with senior Saudi leaders, his counterparts from the Gulf Cooperation Council, and the United Kingdom and the United Nations Special Envoy for Yemen.
"His discussion will focus on the ongoing conflict in Yemen and efforts to restore peace and stability," the release said. "Additionally, the leaders will discuss the region's most pressing challenges, including Syria and our global effort to counter Da'esh and violent extremism."
Ahead of the trip, Human Rights Watch wrote a letter to the secretary of state.
"Throughout your trip in all three countries, we urge you to be clear that the United States expects its partners to protect the equal rights of all, including marginalized communities; to ensure security forces protect instead of prey on civilians; and to commit to, as President [Barack] Obama said on his 2015 trip to Kenya, 'uphold the rule of law, and respect ... human rights, and ... treat everybody who's peaceful and law-abiding fairly and equally," the letter said. "We urge you to reemphasize these sentiments clearly, both in your private meetings and in public commentary."
Sarah Margon, Washington director at Human Rights Watch, said it is an important trip. "The Obama administration will have few remaining opportunities to express its human rights concerns directly to leaders in the region," Margon said in a release. "It shouldn't waste this one."


ATHENS, Greece, Aug. 21 (UPI) -- An outbreak of malaria infections prompted officials to ban blood donations in twelve Greek municipalities.
The Hellenic Center for Disease Control and Prevention instituted the ban after 65 cases of malaria were identified since the start of the year, compared to 85 for all of 2015. Of the 65 "registered" cases, 61 people were infected on the Indian subcontinent or in one of seven Africa, where malaria is widespread, before they arrived in Greece; the remaining four were infected in Greece.
Of the 61 people infected elsewhere, 50 were immigrants and 11 were travelers returning from malaria-infected countries, the center reported.
The districts identified for denial of blood donation are Farkadona, Trikaia, Palama, Evrota, Halkidaia, Thiva, Tempe, Marathonos, Western Achaia, Andravida-Kyllini, Lagada and Pylaia.
Malaria was eradicated from Greece in the 1970s before new cases were reported four years ago. Many municipal spraying protocols, to kill mosquitoes which carry the disease, were curtailed because of budget cuts.


TIKRIT, Iraq, Aug. 21 (UPI) -- Iraq executed 36 prisoners convicted of killing about 1,700 soldiers when Islamic State militants seized a former U.S. base in Tikrit in June 2014, Iraqi official television reported Sunday.
"The ministry of justice executed 36 prisoners in Nasriyah prison after they were found guilty in the crime of Speicher," state-run Iraqiya channel said' Camp Speicher is a former U.S. base in Tikrit.
In June 2014, armed Sunni insurgents attacked Iraqi security forces and captured a large part of the country's northern and western territories. Government troops abandoned their posts and military equipment.
Reports said that some soldiers who abandoned their posts were abducted and killed by IS militants.
Justice Minister Haidar al-Zamili was present at the executions, a spokesman said.
Those executed on Sunday, all believed to be Iraqi citizens, were sentenced to death in February.
Many defendants denied involvement. Some said they had not been near Tikrit during the massacre, others said they were denied access to lawyers and others said they were forced to confess under torture.
Camp Speicher is named after the first U.S. casualty of the 1991 Desert Storm.


DAVAO CITY , Philippines, Aug. 21 (UPI) -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte threatened Sunday to leave the United Nations over criticism of his pursuit of drug dealers.
In his hometown of Davao City, where he spent two decades as mayor before becoming president in a landslide election in May, Duterte suggested the Philippines could align itself with China and African countries to form a more useful international body.
"Maybe we'll just have to decide to separate from the United Nations. If you are that insulting, we should just leave. Take us out of your organization. You have done nothing anyway. When were you here last time? Nothing. Never. Except to criticize," he told the Davao City audience.
Two U.N. human rights specialists last week called Duterte's orders an "incitement to violence and killing, a crime under international law." U.N. Secretary General; Ban Ki-moon and the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime were critical of Duterte's "apparent endorsement of extrajudicial killings, which is illegal and a breach of fundamental rights and freedoms."
Since May, police have killed 650 people in what the Philippine National Police Director Roland Dela Rosa said were justifiably self-defense killings. Suspected vigilantes committed another 900 unexplained murders, and Duterte has accused dozens of political figures and officials of involvement in the drug trade.


GAZIANTEP, Turkey, Aug. 21 (UPI) -- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said a child between ages 12 and 14 detonated a bomb at a wedding late Saturday that killed 51 people and injured 69 others.
Erdogan said the Islamic State was behind the attack during a broadcast by NTV.
The blast occurred in the city of Gaziantep, about 60 miles north of the war-torn Syrian city of Aleppo. More than 200 people were packed into a street in the district of Sahinbey for the Kurdish wedding when the explosion occurred around 11 p.m.
He said the suicide bomber also was believed to have killed two policemen in the city.
Erdogan in a statement before his television appearance said there is "no difference" between the IS, which is based in neighboring Syria, the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party and Fetullah Terrorist Organization, founded by U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, state-run Anadolu Agency reported Sunday.
He has accused Gulen of being behind the recent coup.
"Those, who cannot overcome Turkey and try to provoke people by abusing ethnic and sectarian sensitiveness will not prevail," he said.
Prime Minister Binali Yildirim vowed renewed fighting against terrorist groups. "No matter what this treacherous terror organization is called, we as the people, the state and the government will pursue our determined struggle against it," he said.
The United States condemned the killing in the "strongest possible terms."
"The perpetrators of this barbaric act cynically and cowardly targeted a wedding, killing dozens and leaving scores wounded," National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said in a statement. "We stand with the people of Turkey as they defend their democracy in the face of all forms of terrorism."
Vice President Joe Biden will visit Ankara on Wednesday "to reaffirm our commitment to work together with Turkey, our valued NATO Ally and partner, to confront the scourge of terrorism," according to the statement.
Witnesses described the mayhem.
"We had just walked past the wedding and offered our good wishes when we heard the blast," Ibrahim Ates, a local man, told The New York Times. "Suddenly people started running past us. When we went back to see what had happened, everyone was on the floor, and there were body parts scattered everywhere and blood splattered on the walls."
Mahmut Togrul, a lawmaker with the Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party, said the the bride and groom,
Besna and Nurettin Akdogan, survived the attack and are in stable condition," Togrul said.
"Many of the victims that died were children," he added.
Police found parts of a suicide vest in the area where the blast took place, the Gaziantep chief prosecutor's office said in a statement.
"Everyone here is devastated. We can't even carry out the funerals because the bodies are in pieces. They are struggling to identify the victims," Hilmi Karaca, a Kurdish activist who witnessed the explosion, told The New York Times.
On July 15, at least 240 people were killed in a failed coup aimed at topping the government of Erdogan.
On June 28, IS militants are suspected of storming Istanbul's main airport with guns and bombs, killing at least 44 people.

GAZIANTEP, Turkey, Aug. 20 (UPI) -- More than two dozen people were killed and many others were injured Saturday in an attack on a wedding party attended by hundreds in Turkey, officials said.
Police said an explosion, possibly a suicide bomber, targeted the outdoor nuptials in Gaziantep province -- located near the border with Syria in southern Turkey.
Officials said Saturday that at least 22 people were killed and nearly 100 were wounded.
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet ÅimÅek said the death toll might be higher than initially reported, The Daily Sabah reported.
"There are people who lost their lives and we have initial information suggesting it was a bomb attack," Mehmet Erdogan, of Turkey's Justice and Development Party (AKP), said.

An AKP deputy, Åamil Tayyar, said the Islamic State was behind Saturday's attack.
Authorities, though, are looking into the possibility that the wedding attack might have been orchestrated by Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) militants, due to the fact that the bombing occurred exactly four years to the day after a different strike by the left-wing group killed 10 in 2012.
Police say the PKK was responsible for three attacks in Turkey earlier this week that killed several people and wounded more than 200.
Southern Turkey has been targeted by several militant attacks over the past year, much of them related to the ongoing hostilities in neighboring Syria -- particularly Aleppo.


ALEPPO, Syria, Aug. 20 (UPI) -- Ali Daqneesh, the 10-year-old brother of Omran Daqneesh whose haunting photo has become the new face of the Syrian civil war, died, officials said.
Ali died Saturday as the result of injuries sustained in Wednesday's airstrike, said Yousef Saddiq, the director of the Aleppo Media Center.
Omran and Ali were pulled from the rubble Wednesday night in the battered city of Aleppo, north of Damascus, along with their two sisters and parents.
A video of Omran being pulled from the remains of their family home has brought world-wide attention to the ongoing war in Syria.
The video of Omran, shot by photojournalist Mahmoud Raglan for the Aleppo Media Center, has since gone viral, even bringing CNN anchor Kate Bolduan to tears while on air.
The war is responsible for taking the lives of more than 400,000 people, 41,000 of them children, as the Syrian regime and its supporters battle for control of the city, according to CBS correspondent  Holly Williams.
Omran has since been released from the hospital. His mother is still in critical condition.

ORLANDO, Fla., Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Florida authorities aren't 100 percent certain they captured the alligator that killed a 2-year-old Nebraska boy wading in the shallow waters at a Disney World resort.
This was among the details that emerged after the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the Orange County Sheriff's Office released their reports Monday in Lane Gaves' June 14 death, which was ruled an accident by the sheriff's office.
The FWC said in its report that it captured six alligators 7 to 8 feet long that would have been capable of such an attack. Two females were found within two-fifths of a mile from where the toddler was attacked, but DNA and bite comparisons were inconclusive.
"While we cannot say with absolute certainty that the subject animal has been taken... it is very likely one of the two females captured close to the attack location was the offending animal," FWC said in its report.
Lane's body was found intact in the Seven Seas Lagoon 16 hours after he disappeared. An autopsy showed he died from drowning and traumatic injuries.
Officials said Lane and his father were building a sand castle in ankle-deep or less water when the alligator bit Lane's head and he was pulled into the water. Previous reports said that they were "wading" into the water, where "no swimming" signs were posted.
Neither person provoked the animal, according to the FWC report.
The father, Matt Graves, attempted to pry the gator's mouth open but the animal broke free.
At least two people reported to Disney workers seeing an alligator in the water before the attack.
One tourist saw a gator from his hotel porch and then pointed it out to a Disney employee. He mentioned he saw children playing in the ankle-deep water and just as he was going to warn them about the alligator, he heard the mother scream.
The man-made Seven Seas Lagoon's water drops off sharply from the shore, making it not an ideal alligator habitat.
The alligator may have lost its fear of humans because of living in close proximity with large numbers of people, the FWC said.
"The victim could have been mistaken for some of the animal's normal prey like opossum, armadillo or raccoon," FWC officials wrote.
Rock barriers will replace a temporary rope fence along the beaches on Disney property.


RICHMOND, Va., Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Virginia Gov. Terry R. McAuliffe has begun what's expected to be a laborious and time-consuming enterprise -- restoring the rights to vote and perform other civic duties for hundreds of thousands of convicted felons, on an individual basis.
The governor announced Monday the rights had been restored to about 13,000 former prisoners -- which will allow them to vote, run for office, perform jury duty and become notaries public. He previously said he planned to do the same for 200,000 felons.
"Restoring the rights of individuals who have served their time and re-entered society is the right thing to do," McAuliffe said in his announcement. "Virginia's felon disenfranchisement policy is rooted in a tragic history of voter suppression and marginalization of minorities, and it needs to be overturned."
Monday was McAuliffe's second go-round at restoring the rights -- after an earlier and far less complicated attempt was rejected by the Virginia Supreme Court.
In April, he issued a blanket clemency order to restore the rights for all felons who had completed their prison sentences and were no longer on probation or parole. Opponents argued that voting rights should be restored on a case-by-case basis -- out of concern for the types of crimes committed and whether they warrant further rights suspension -- and not in one giant, sweeping act.
The Virginia Supreme Court agreed and nullified the governor's order. McAuliffe replied by stating he would restore the rights individually if that's what was necessary. Monday was the beginning of that process.
"The court directed the Secretary of the Commonwealth to delete from the records any individuals who had their rights restored under [the blanket] orders, and for the Department of Elections to cancel the voter registration of any individual who had been restored under these orders," McAuliffe's office said Monday. "After a thorough review process, Gov. McAuliffe will direct the secretary's office to process the restoration paperwork for each individual that meet his criteria for restoration."
The Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution permits each state to determine its own laws regarding felons' voting rights.
McAuliffe also reiterated Monday that he will try and get the Virginia General Assembly to permanently repeal the state's policy against automatic restoration of the rights for rehabilitated felons.


MILWAUKEE, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Body camera footage of a fatal police shooting in Milwaukee won't be released until the Milwaukee County district attorney decides whether to charge anyone, Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel said Monday.
Sylville Smith was shot dead when he ran from a traffic stop about 3:30 p.m. Aug. 13. Police Chief Edward Flynn said body camera footage shows Smith was armed and turning toward Officer Dominique Heaggan.
Two officers were wearing body cameras.
But Attorney General Brad Schimel said at a news conference release of the footage could compromise the investigation and
it won't answer all the questions about what led to the fatal shooting.
"The investigation is ongoing and it is done only when the prosecutor is satisfied that the investigators have given them all we can," Schimel said. "That means until a charging decision is final there could always be follow-up."
The investigation has included witness interviews, and looked at whether there was a relationship between Smith and the officer who shot him, Heaggan and Smith, both black, knew each other from the Sherman Park neighborhood where both grew up, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.
"In the end, the public needs to have confidence that the process was an effective search for the truth," Schimel said.
An autopsy on Smith showed one gunshot wound to the chest and one to the right arm.
"We do not want to create the worst-case scenario, that the [district attorney] determines that charges might be appropriate and then cannot complete a successful investigation because we let the investigation get compromised," Schmiel said.
Heaggan became a sworn officer in 2013 and no complaint have been filed against him with the city's Fire and Police Commission.


WASHINGTON, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Speedo USA and Ralph Lauren both announced Monday they are dropping their sponsorship deals with U.S. swimmer Ryan Lochte following his statement over the weekend that he "over-exaggerated" what happened in Rio de Janeiro.
After saying for several days that the taxi they were riding in on the way home from a party was pulled over and that they were robbed at gunpoint, Lochte on Saturday said he had "over-exaggerated" and apologized for his behavior that overshadowed the final days of the Olympic Games. He said he takes "full responsibility" for three swimmers -- Gunnar Bentz, Jack Conger and James Feigen -- and himself vandalizing a gas station on Aug. 14 after a night of partying.
Surveillance video shows the swimmers going behind the gas station, coming back out, and then getting into the taxi as a guard approaches. Another shows them out of the car, sitting on the ground with their hands on their heads. One of the guards admitted that he had drawn his gun on the swimmers. They were released after paying a $50 fine for pulling down a sign.
Lochte and the other swimmers could be stripped of their gold medals. Speedo USA dropped Lochte on Monday.
"Speedo USA today announces the decision to end its sponsorship of Ryan Lochte. As part of this decision, Speedo USA will donate a $50,000 portion of Lochte's fee to Save the Children, a global charity partner of Speedo USA's parent company, for children in Brazil," Speedo USA said in a statement. "While we have enjoyed a winning relationship with Ryan for over a decade and he has been an important member of the Speedo team, we cannot condone behavior that is counter to the values this brand has long stood for. We appreciate his many achievements and hope he moves forward and learns from this experience."
Ralph Lauren has taken Ryan Lochte's name off its Olympic endorsers page, and told ESPN on Monday that it will not renew its sponsorship deal with Lochte.
Lochte has two remaining endorsement deals -- with Gentle Hair Removal and Airweave, a Japanese mattress maker. Airweave has pledged to stand by Lochte.


WASHINGTON, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- The FBI has uncovered an additional 14,900 previously undisclosed emails linked to Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state, State Department lawyers confirmed before a federal judge on Monday.
Previouisly, the State Department turned over 30,000 work-related documents from Clinton's lawyers in 2014.
The agency told District Judge James E. Boasberg that it is "prioritizing" the new emails, determining which are a personal nature or duplicates previously released emails.
State Department lawyers said they anticipate releasing the first batch of emails in mid-October -- weeks before the Nov. 9 presidential election.
Last week, government lawyers disclosed that the FBI turned over six computer discs of information to the State Department.
Boasberg ordered the agency to provide a status update on Sept. 22 on how many of the documents it has reviewed can be released under a Freedom of Information Act request.
Lawyers for Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, demanded release of the emails.
"FBI found almost 15,000 new Clinton documents. When will State release them?" Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton posted on Twitter on Monday morning.
Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit in May 2015 seeking the emails while Clinton was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.
U.S. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan on Friday ordered Clinton to answer questions in writing from Judicial Watch about her use of the private email server. The group wants to question Clinton under oath and in person. Sullivan said Judicial Watch must submit its questions to Clinton by Oct. 14 and she has 30 days to respond.
On July 7, the FBI decided not to charge Clinton in the handling of classified material in her email setup, but FBI Director James B. Comey called her "extremely careless." Comey said investigators found no evidence the emails "were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them."
Members of Congress will receive notes from Clinton's interview on July 2 with the FBI about her private email server.


NEW YORK, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Donald Trump said Monday "I have very little debt" in response to a New York Times report that the presidential candidate has at least $650 million in debt among the companies he owns.
The Times report published Saturday documented the figure, which is twice the amount listed in a 104-page financial disclosure in his bid for president.
"Well, the value -- if the value is $11 billion, it's a very small amount of debt," Trump said on Fox & Friends in a telephone interview Monday. "I have very little debt relative to the assets. I have massive assets."
Trump added, "I think I have less than 5 percent or so in debt, which is a very low debt."
The Times discovered much of his wealth is tied up in three passive partnerships that owe an additional $2 billion to lenders, including those holding the $950 million loan on the Avenue of the Americas building in Manhattan. Trump would not be held liable if those loans go into default, the Trump organization said.
The Times noted the lenders of the Avenue of the Americas building include the Bank of China, a bank in a country that Trump has complained about with an unfair trade advantage.
"Now, the smart people that read that story thought it was a good story," Trump said to Fox. "Some people didn't understand the story, but when you get to $300 million or $600 million, but you have massive buildings and big assets that's a very small amount of money. I have very little debt."
Trump has previously bragged that he's the "king of debt."
"I'm great with debt. Nobody knows debt better than me," Trump told CBS in June. "I've made a fortune by using debt, and if things don't work out I renegotiate the debt. I mean, that's a smart thing, not a stupid thing."
But Trump said that he does not like national debt.
"It's going to be very soon $21 trillion... And I will tell you, we are sitting on a time bomb and Hillary Clinton doesn't have a clue. And President [Barack] Obama has pretty much doubled the debt since he's been in office and somebody's going to pay a big price. We have to start chopping that debt down," Trump said to CBS.


FORT WORTH, Texas, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- A judge issued a preliminary national injunction blocking federal transgender guidelines for public schools.
U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor of Fort Worth, Texas, said in a ruling issued late Sunday that federal officials did not follow procedures in creating the guidelines, and that the guidelines conflict with current statutes and regulations. In issuing the injunction, O'Connor sided with 13 states, including Texas, who maintain federal directives issued in May by the U.S. Department of Education unfairly supplant local school control and threaten student safety.
The 38-page preliminary injunction, coming at the start of the school year, is a blow to the Obama administration's principle that transgender students should use restrooms corresponding to their gender identity.
The ruling Sunday comes after the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked an order on Aug. 3 allowing a transgender student to use the boys' restrooms in a Gloucester County, Va., high school. The school district said boys' restrooms were reserved for "biological males."
Federal officials argued any interpretation of "sex" in anti-discrimination legislation also includes sexual identity, and noted the states' lawsuit was filed before any school action was taken.
O'Connor said that the Texas case involved failure of the federal administration to follow rule-making procedures, and was less a case of students' rights.
"This case presents the difficult issue of balancing the protection of students' rights and that of personal privacy when using school bathrooms, locker rooms, showers, and other intimate facilities, while ensuring that no student is unnecessarily marginalized while attending school. The resolution of this difficult policy issue is not, however, the subject of this order," O'Connor wrote.
We are pleased that the court ruled against the Obama Administration's latest illegal federal overreach," Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said after the ruling was announced. "This president is attempting to rewrite the laws enacted by the elected representatives of the people, and is threatening to take away federal funding from schools to force them to conform. That cannot be allowed to continue, which is why we took action to protect states and school districts, who are charged under state law to establish a safe and disciplined environment conducive to student learning."


WASHINGTON, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- The UPI/CVoter daily presidential tracking poll released Monday shows Donald Trump closing in on Hillary Clinton's lead -- which now stands at 0.7 percent -- possibly a reflection of the Republican sticking largely to the issues last week.
The online poll shows Clinton with 48.19 percent to Trump's 47.47 in polling through Saturday. In one day, her lead declined by 2.9 percentage points. On Friday, she led Trump 49.45 to 45.85.
Trump's rise in the UPI/CVoter poll could indicate voters are being swayed by what the real estate mogul says -- and doesn't say -- in public.
Trump's tone in his speeches has been tempered in the past week as he relies on a teleprompter in remarks at rallies and largely stays away from more controversial statements. On Thursday in Charlotte, N.C., Trump said he regretted past comments that have caused people "personal pain."
Trump has regained ground he lost during tracking periods when he made controversial comments about the Muslim Gold Star family of U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq, as well as when he hedged whether he'd endorse Speaker Paul Ryan in his re-election campaign. Clinton also improved in the polls when Trump made comments about the 2nd Amendment some critics interpreted as a veiled threat against the Democratic nominee.
So while Clinton largely sticks to her scripted speeches and declines to take questions from reporters, swings in the UPI/CVoter daily tracker could fluctuate based on what Trump has to say, or chooses not to say, in a given time period.
Also within this past week, Trump has overhauled his senior campaign staff. Trump hired former Breitbart executive Steve Bannon, and also promoted veteran pollster and personal confidant Kellyanne Conway to a senior position. And campaign chairman Paul Manafort has departed.
On Friday, Trump also toured flood-ravaged Louisiana, a move Democratic Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards applauded for shining a light on the disaster there.
Meanwhile, the post-convention bumps both candidates enjoyed have largely leveled out this week. One group that has not rebounded since the two major party conventions, though, are those in the "others" category -- defined in the poll as any respondent who declined to pick either Trump or Clinton.
In mid-July, up to 16.85 percent of voters chose "others" in the UPI/CVoter poll, a number that has continuously dropped since. "Others" voters dropped below double digits July 21, the last day of the Republican National Convention.
As of Saturday, 4.34 percent of the respondents chose this option compared with 5.48 percent the previous Saturday.
The UPI/CVoter online tracking poll surveys about 200 people each day, leading to a sample size of roughly 1,400 people during any seven-day span.
Because the poll is conducted online and individuals self-select to participate, a margin of error cannot be calculated. The poll has a credibility interval of 3 percentage points. This seven-day span includes data collected from Aug. 14-20, when 1,689 individuals were surveyed. Of them, 1,191 identified themselves as likely voters.


EAST HAMPTON , N.Y., Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said Hillary Clinton is wrong to blame him for her use of a private email server.
"Her people have been trying to pin it on me," Powell, 79, said on Saturday at an event in East Hampton, N.Y. "It doesn't bother me...The truth is, she was using [the private server] for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did."
Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, has been involved in a scandal regarding mishandling of emails during her term as secretary of state, and when asked by the FBI about her use of a private server for unclassified communications instead of one assigned by the State Department, she reportedly contended Powell suggested she use the private server. The FBI concluded its investigation of Clinton in July, recommending that no charges be filed against her. FBI Director James Comey, though, called her actions "extremely careless."
Powell's suggestion reportedly came at a dinner attended by other former secretaries of state, including Madeleine Albright, Henry Kissinger and Condoleezza Rice. Although a spokesman first said Powell had no recollection of any conversations at the dinner, he later told NBC News in a statement that "He did write former Secretary Clinton an email memo describing his use of his personal AOL email account for unclassified messages and how it vastly improved communications within the State Department."


ROANOKE, Texas, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Five railcars fell into a Texas' Denton Creek after a train carrying coals derailed Sunday, local authorities said, adding no injuries were reported.
"Twenty railcards had derailed and approximately five railcars fell into Denton Creek," the City of Roanoke Police Department said in a statement. "The Roanoke Fire department confirmed the railcars were transporting coal and not any hazardous materials and no injuries reported."
Police said people should avoid highway U.S. Route 377 in Texas as it is closed from Farm to Market Road 1171 through Bobcat Boulevard until about 8 p.m. on Monday.

VICTORVILLE, Calif., Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Evacuation orders were lifted in San Bernardino County and utility companies were working to restore service to residents as Southern California's Blue Cut Fire neared containment, fire authorities said Sunday.
The explosive wildfire burned 37,020 acres and firefighters have the blaze 85 percent contained, authorities said as all 82,000 displaced residences were allowed to go home. Many will not have a home to return to.
Cal Fire said a preliminary estimate indicated at least 105 homes were destroyed and three damaged. Another 216 outbuildings were destroyed and six damaged.
The cause of the fire, which began east of Los Angeles on Tuesday and quickly grew into a major blaze, is still not known.
Evacuation orders were still in effect for the so-called Chimney fire in Northern California, which has scorched more than 27,000 acres and destroyed 47 structures. It remains 35 percent contained.
One of the buildings threatened by the fire is the landmark Hearst Castle, built by newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst and the model for Xanadu in Orson Welles' classic film Citizen Kane. It was closed Sunday after the fire reached an area near the mansion's water supply. The historic site will remain closed Monday with staff prepared to evacuate the mansion's priceless works of art if the fire moves closer.


BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Aug. 21 (UPI) -- 13 people have been wounded after a shooting at a house party early Sunday in Bridgeport, Conn., police said.
At least two shooters fired at party goers in a backyard through the backyard hedges, police said. The multiple victims were all rushed to local hospitals with one victim in critical condition.
The wounded include 11 men and two women, police said. Most had non-life threatening injuries to the lower body, but one man suffered a gunshot wound to the face and a woman is in critical condition with a gunshot to the face.
"There was so much noise, music and yelling, everybody singing," said next door neighbor Hector Torres, who said he heard five to seven shots.
Police are investigating, but a motive is not known. Police said regular patrols will be established in the area.


SALEM, Ore., Aug. 21 (UPI) -- Two men determined by state officials in Oregon to be at fault for a forest fire that burned more than 26,000 acres are responsible for reimbursing the $37 million it cost to put the blaze out.
The Oregon State Department of Forestry plans to bill Dominic Decarlo and Cloyd Deardorff the full cost of putting out the month-long Stouts Creek fire in 2015 after determining the illegal use of their lawnmowers caused it.
Both men were cited for using lawnmowers -- illegal at that time of year between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. -- which started the fire.
"We're trying to make people aware that they have some responsibility -- so people know there are consequences when you start [a wildfire]," Jeff Bonebrake, fire investigation and cost recovery coordinator for the State Department of Forestry, told The Oregonian. "If we can prevent one, that saves everyone a lot grief."
The wildfire started July 30, 2015, forcing evacuations and burning 26,452 acres of timber and wildlife habitat on private and national forest land over the course of a month.
Oregon holds people financially responsible for the costs of extinguishing fires, with the $37 million bill expected to cover the costs of firefighting crews, helicopters and bulldozers used to suppress the fire.
"It's critical that everyone living, working, or recreating in wildland areas know and follow the Public Use Fire Restrictions that are in place throughout the summer," Melvin Thornton, district manager for the Douglas Forest Protective Association, told KPIC-TV. "Individuals that are found to be in violation of the regulations will be cited and if a fire results from their actions, they may be held liable for all fire suppression costs."
During the summer, fire prevention regulations restrict the mowing of dry grass, non-industrial use of chainsaws, the cutting, grinding and welding of metal, off-road driving, campfires, debris burning, fireworks and smoking.
The bill is expected to be finalized and mailed to Decarlo and Deardorff in the next several weeks after the exact final numbers are calculated. The bill will include a full invoice summarizing the costs, though Bonebrake said it can be appealed.
"Initially we treat it as if we are going to [receive the full amount]," Bonebrake said. "But you can't squeeze blood out of a turnip."


STATE COLLEGE, Pa., Aug. 21 (UPI) -- Police charged a second person in the death of a Penn State professor early Sunday, days after his body was found at the bottom of a quarry on August 17.
Danelle Rae Geier on Sunday joined George Ishler, who was arraigned Friday, on charges they allegedly plotted and carried out the murder of Penn State professor Ronald Bettig because they thought his will left them money, the New York Daily News reported.
Geier, 32, and Ishler, 39, allegedly planned the murder for two weeks, partially because Geier was angry with Bettig, 56, for criticizing how she was raising her son and they thought he had added her to his recently signed will, according to police.
Geier and her son were living with Bettig when she and Ishler allegedly started planning to kill him during a trip to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, agreeing Ishler would drown him in the ocean, the Centre Daily Times reported.
Geier allegedly told police that when Ishler did not kill Bettig in the ocean, they agreed to lure him to a quarry to harvest marijuana. Police said in court records that Ishler told Geier the plants were close to the edge of the quarry and Bettig might fall, but if he didn't Ishler would "help" make sure it happened.
The two are accused of staging a scene near the quarry edge, leaving his car with items from his house nearby, and reported him missing to police on August 15. Police found Bettig on August 17, dead of the 80-foot fall from the quarry's edge.
Geier and Ishler have a history with drugs, Geier's sister, Angela Hill, told WTAJ-TV, but that whatever their issue with Bettig was nobody deserves to be murdered.
"She deserves whatever punishment she gets," Hill said of her sister, explaining the associate professor of media studies had invited Geier and her son to live with him when they were homeless.
Police have charged Geier and Ishler with first- and third-degree murder, aggravated assault and tampering with evidence, in addition to Geier's charge of conspiracy to commit murder.


MIAMI, Aug. 21 (UPI) -- Tropical Storm Fiona is continuing its northwest trek in the Atlantic as two disturbances have formed, the National Hurricane Center said Sunday.
Fiona was 825 miles east/northeast of the Leeward Islands with maximum sustained gusts of 40 mph and is moving at 15 mph, the center said in its 11 a.m. update. The storm is projected to weaken to a tropical depression by Monday morning as it encounters upper level wind shear during the next day and a half. A storm is listed as a tropical storm when it reaches 39 mph.
A tropical wave was moving off the coast of Africa with a 90 percent chance of developing into a tropical system in the next five days.
"A tropical depression is likely to form during the next couple of days while the system moves westward and then northwestward over the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean," the center said in its 8 a.m. outlook.
Another disorganized cluster of showers and storms is about 1,150 miles east of the Lesser Antilles and has a 50 percent chance of developing into a tropical system in the next five days.
"Environmental conditions are forecast to be marginally conducive for development during the next few ddays, and any development should be slow to occur," the center said.
After Fiona, the next two hurricane names are Gaston and Hermine. They may come into use rather quickly as two more systems farther out in the Atlantic are expected to strengthen into organized storms.


PHOENIX , Aug. 21 (UPI) -- A highly contagious parasite has infected and sickened over 100 people in Maricopa County, Ariz., swimming pools since August 4, officials said.
The microscopic parasite cryptosporidium, or "Crypto," was first discovered on August 4 and was found in at least 20 public pools. The infection, induced by ingesting pool water, causes stomach cramps, vomiting and fever, and lasts one to two weeks. It spreads in water contaminated with human fecal material, and is not always killed by chlorine in the water.
Officials did not identify which Phoenix-area pools were infected.
The Maricopa County Department of Public Health advised "that any facility in which an infected person swam prior to illness or while sick be treated for Crypto. MCESD is notifying the facilities that are affected and recommending that CDC [Centers for Disease Control] guidelines for decontamination are being followed."
Dr. Rebecca Sunenshine of the MCDPH added in a statement, "Right now, this outbreak is community-wide and there is an increased risk to those swimming at recreational water facilities. The most important thing the public can do to prevent spread of this disease is to stay out of the water if you have diarrhea, until at least two weeks after symptoms resolve."
Pool users are encouraged to take frequent restroom breaks when out of the pool, avoid drinking pool water and to thoroughly wash their hands with soap and water.


WASHINGTON, Aug. 21 (UPI) -- Donald Trump's position on forced deportation for undocumented immigrants is now "to be determined," his new campaign manager said on Sunday.
That's what Kellyanne Conway, the Republican nominee's campaign manager, said on CNN's State of the Union when repeatedly asked whether the Republican presidential nominee has changed its position on deportation.
Trump said last fall people in the country illegally should be removed. But in June he softened his statement to say he would deport only "bad dudes."
On Saturday, Trump met with a Hispanic Advisory Council at Trump Tower in New York and mentioned a "humane and efficient" way to deal with undocumented immigrants, according to Buzzfeed.
"So what Donald Trump said yesterday in that meeting ... varied little from what he has said publicly," Conway said. "What he supports is to make sure we enforce the law, that we are respectful of those Americans who are looking for jobs, and that we are fair and humane to those who live among us."
In another matter, Conway reiterated that the candidate won't release his tax returns because are under audit.
When she didn't work for the campaign five months ago, Conway urged Trump to "be transparent" and release his returns. But since joining the campaign, she understands the seriousness of an audit.
Conway and Breitbart News' Steve Bannon were hired to run the campaign last week.
"This is the best week, I think, so far in the Trump campaign," Conway said on ABC's This Week. "Mostly because he's able to be himself, the authentic Donald Trump."
Trump's tone in speeches has changed and he began using a teleprompter. On Thursday in Charlotte, N.C., Trump said he regretted past comments that have caused people "personal pain."
Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus predicted the change will attract more voters.
"I think what you're going to see is these polls beginning to tighten in the next couple weeks, and by Labor Day or thereafter I think you're going to be back to an even race if we continue down this path," Priebus told ABC's George Stephanopoulos.


ORLANDO, Fla., Aug. 21 (UPI) -- Lou Pearlman, who launched the boy bands Backstreet Boys and 'NSync, died in prison while serving a 25-year sentence for a $30 million Ponzi scheme, a federal inmate database shows.
Pearlman, 62, died Friday in Federal Correctional Institution at Texarkana, Texas, of undisclosed causes, according to the database. Multiple sources also confirmed the death to Billboard.
'NSync singer Lance Bass posted to Twitter on Saturday that Pearlman "might not have been a stand-up businessman, but I wouldn't be doing what I love today (without) his influence. RIP Lou."
Starting in the 1990s, Pearlman managed the Backstreet Boys, 'NSync, O-Town and the Chippendales. O-Town was formed from the reality series Making the Band on ABC and MTV from 2000 to 2003.
Pearlman's extravagant lifestyle, including a mansion in Orlando, Fla., came to a halt in 2006 he was found to be running the Ponzi scheme, a fraudulent investment scam.
He fled from regulators and creditors, but was caught by FBI agents in Bali, Indonesia, under the false name, A. Incognito Johnson. He was expelled from the country and arrested in Guam.
In 2008, he pleaded guilty to money laundering and making a false statement in a 2007 bankruptcy proceeding.
Money was funneled through his Trans Continental Airlines and Transcontinental Airlines Travel Services companies for worthless stock.
Band members were among those filing civil suits.
During sentencing, he said, "I'm truly sorry, your honor, to all the people who have been hurt and victimized by my actions. Over the past nine months since my arrest, I've come to realize the harm that has been done. I now want to do whatever I can to help resolve that harm."
Orlando attorney Mark NeJame represented Pearlman on civil cases. He described Pearlman -- known as "Big Poppa" by friends -- as a "colorful character" with different lives.
"He'd never forget to call you on a holiday or on your birthday," he told the Orlando Sentinel. "...but later when you found out all he'd been involved in, it was like a different side of him that he kept from everybody. We all had no earthly idea he was involved with all of that."
In the 1980s, he founded a helicopter taxi service in New York City and then moved into blimp leasing.
But he left the blimp business after some crashed.
He moved into the music industry when he remembered chartering a plane in the late 1980s for New Kids on the Block. He placed a classified ad in the Orlando Sentinel for teen male vocalists, who became the Backstreet Boys.
In a 2007 Vanity Fair article about Pearlman titled, "Mad About the Boys," he was accused of sexual harassment.
"None of these kids will ever admit anything happened," one attorney who sued Pearlman told Vanity Fair. "They're all too ashamed, and if the truth came out it would ruin their careers."
In 2014, Bass told The Hollywood Reporter: "We would hear things, for sure. He would always have young boy limo drivers for Trans Continental Records. Those limo drivers would always be put into different boy bands. Then I'd hear rumors that he would molest the boys before they would even get into the groups. I don't know how much of that is true, but to me, where there's smoke, there's fire."
Pearlman denied any inappropriate relations.

CITRONELLE , Ala., Aug. 21 (UPI) -- A suspect is in custody as Mobile County, Ala., police investigate the slaying of five people.
Five adults, one of whom was pregnant, were found killed in a home in the southern Alabama city of Citronelle early Saturday. Authorities also rescued a 4-month-old baby from the scene.
Mobile County Sherriff's Office detective Paul Burch said firearms and at least one other type of weapon was used in the assault. He said it was not clear if the victims were attacked while sleeping or if they engaged in a struggle. A long investigation of the crime scene is expected, police said.
"We're not there yet. We have a horrible scene here," Mobile County District Attorney Ashley Rich commented, adding the victims were "brutally and viciously murdered."
Burch said a 911 call Saturday morning reporting a trespasser alerted police to the home but no trespasser was found. A woman later told Citronelle police she had been abducted, but escaped, prompting a return to the home, where police found the bodies. The woman, police said, is believed to have a relationship with Derrick Dearman, who drove 30 miles to a Leakesville, Miss., police station and confessed to the killings. Burch added Dearman is the only suspect in the incident.
Burch said he expects Dearman to be charged with "five or six counts of capital murder. Sad to say, one of the females was about five months pregnant."


WASHINGTON, Aug. 20 (UPI) -- Facing criticism for remaining in New England on vacation instead of visiting flood-ravaged Louisiana, President Barack Obama will travel to Baton Rouge next week.
The White House said Obama will make the trip on Tuesday, which will follow visits to the area by multiple members of his administration this week.
"While in Martha's Vineyard, the President has received updates on the situation in Louisiana, including from the DHS Secretary and the FEMA Administrator, who took separate trips there," White House Director for Incident Management Integration Policy Sean Griffin wrote in a news release Friday. "Together they have determined that the President will visit Baton Rouge, Louisiana on Tuesday."
The president and the first family arrived on the Massachusetts island Aug. 6 for a 16-day vacation. In recent days, Obama has received criticism from some who faulted him for failing to cut the trip short to visit flood victims in Louisiana.
During a visit Friday, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump slammed Obama for his absence.
"The president says he doesn't want to come, he is trying to get out of a golf game," Trump told volunteers at Greenwell Springs Baptist Church.
At least 13 people were killed this month after severe rains caused flash flooding in the Bayou State.
"The President is mindful of the impact that his travel has on first responders and wants to ensure that his presence does not interfere with ongoing recovery efforts," Griffin added. "He is also eager to get a first-hand look at the impact of the devastating floods, hear from more officials about the response, including how the federal government can assist and tell the people of Louisiana that the American people will be with them as they rebuild their community and come back stronger than ever."
The Obamas are scheduled to return to Washington on Monday.


SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY, Calif., Aug. 20 (UPI) -- Firefighters gained more control Saturday over a savage blaze in the Southern California wilderness that's so far destroyed more than 300 homes and other structures, and blackened nearly 60 square miles of land.
Crews continued to fight the Blue Cut Fire overnight Friday and now have the flames nearly three-quarters contained. Officials said containment was at about 70 percent by Saturday afternoon -- up from just 26 percent a day earlier and 40 percent Friday night. More than 37,000 acres in San Bernardino County have been charred.
The wildfire started Tuesday near the Cajon Pass off Interstate 15, about 65 miles northeast of Los Angeles.
Some of the evacuations were lifted Friday, allowing some of the 82,000 people under mandatory orders to return to their homes -- if there was a home to return to.
"We know there are going to be people who are going to come home to nothing in a fire like this, that seemed to burn at will and jump literally a half-mile ahead of itself," San Bernardino County Fire Chief Mark Hartwig said.
Saturday, officials said at least 105 homes had been destroyed, along with more than 200 other structures. However, not one death or injury has been reported.
"The crews are still working to determine that everyone made it out safe and there were no fatalities in this fire," Daniel Berlant, a spokesman for Cal Fire, said.


More than 34,000 buildings, though, are still threatened by the fast-moving fire, which is being fed by extreme drought conditions. Saturday, fire crews focused on the communities of Lytle Creek and Wrightwood.
"There's still internal burning that has to be watched," U.S. Forest Service official Robert Taylor said.
The fire shut down stretches of several roads in the area, including California Highway 138 and Interstate 15, which is the main route between Los Angeles and Las Vegas.
More than 2,600 firefighters are working to put out the flames, officials said. The U.S. Forest Service's website lists 275 fire engines, 32 bulldozers, 26 water tenders, 10 air tankers and 14 helicopters on the scene.
The cause of the fire, which is one of several burning in California, is not yet known.
The Chimney Fire in San Luis Obispo County has burned more than 15,000 acres and is 32 percent contained. They Clayton Fire, started by an arsonist in Northern California, has destroyed about 300 structures, 4,000 acres and is 80 percent contained.

The company will also deliver a laser system that is sized to meet MQ-9 integration requirements.
Work will be conducted in California and has a September 2017 completion date.
The Missile Defense Agency is the contracting activity.


TEWKSBURY, Mass., Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Raytheon has been awarded a $92 million U.S. Navy contract for engineering and manufacturing development of the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar, or EASR, the company announced Friday.
The deal includes options which, if exercised, would bring the cumulative value of the contract to $723 million.
The cost-plus-incentive-fee contract calls for two configuration variants of the radar, Raytheon said in a statement.
The variants include a rotating phased array and a three-face, fixed-phase array.
Raytheon will build, integrate and test an EASR engineering development model.
The base contract begins with design work leading to preliminary design review and culminates with system acceptance of the engineering development model at the end of testing.
Work will be performed in Masschusetts, Virginia, Missouri, New Jersey, Indiana, Georgia, Wisconsin and Minnesota, and is expected to be completed by February 2020.
Naval Sea Systems Command is the contracting activity.
EASR will be deployed on the future USS John F. Kennedy, the second Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier that is set to debut in 2020, the U.S. Naval Institute reported last year.


Public health and medical advocates have been working for nearly two years to increase California's tobacco tax, one of the nation's lowest, by $2. The current tax, a mere 87 cents a pack, ranks close to tobacco-growing states like Kentucky.
The proposal that will be on the ballot in November as Proposition 56, the California Healthcare, Research and Prevention Tobacco Tax Act of 2016, allocates most of the revenue to pay for expanded medical services for poor people through Medicaid, known as MediCal in California.
More important, it includes crucial funds to reinvigorate California's aggressive and effective, but fading, tobacco control and research programs.
Heart disease, stroke, lung disease, cancer and other tobacco-induced diseases kill more people than car accidents, murder, suicide, alcohol, illegal drugs and AIDS combined. As director of the University of California San Francisco Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education, I study smoking. I also study â and have felt â the effects of the powerful tobacco lobby. I know what the tobacco companies have done in the past and can see what they are doing in California to block this proposal.
Californians voters can show the rest of the country how to stand up to out-of-state bullies Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds and improve the lives of millions.
Aggressive efforts worked, so Big Tobacco fought back

Health advocates had to go to the trouble and expense of putting this on the ballot because tobacco companies dominate the legislature. Despite 35 attempts by health advocates in the last 34 years, the legislature has raised the tobacco tax  only once â by just 2 cents, in 1993 â since 1967. With a tax of just 87 cents per pack of cigarettes, California, the country's most populous state, ranks 37th among the states in its tobacco tax.
California is one of only three states that has not raised its tobacco tax in the 21st century. California's cigarette tax is so low that even with a $2 increase it would still only rank only ninth.
Big Tobacco ponied up $36 million to get started
On July 12, Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds finally appeared when they coughed up $17 million to create "No on 56 - Stop the Special Interest Tax Grab. Major Funding by Philip Morris USA Inc. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, with a Coalition of Taxpayers, Educators, Healthcare Professionals, Law Enforcement, Labor, and Small Businesses." And on Aug. 5, they put in another $19 million, bringing their total so far to fight Proposition 56 to $36 million.
The "No" campaign, as usual, is not what it appears to be. To date, not a penny has come from "taxpayers, educators, healthcare professionals, law enforcement, labor or small businesses." The only reason Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds included their names in the committee name is that California's strong campaign finance disclosure law requires top donors â in this case the only donors â be identified. Normally, the tobacco companies stay in the shadows.
For comparison, North Dakota's 44-cent tobacco tax is even lower than California's, ranking 47th. Like California, health advocates have mounted an initiative  to raise it to $2.20. But because North Dakota lacks California's strong public disclosure law, Philip Morris (Altria) and RJ Reynolds  left names off "North Dakotans Against the 400% Tax Increase" despite dropping $859,873 so far to oppose that initiative.
And what is the cigarette companies' leading argument against the California initiative? They complain, "Prop 56 allocates just 13 percent of new tobacco tax money to treat smokers or stop kids from starting." And, "If we are going to tax smokers another $1.4 billion per year, more should be dedicated to treating them and keeping kids from starting."
This is a smart argument for the companies to make. Research has consistently shown it is their smartest argument.
Yet, while it may be their smartest argument, it does not always work. In 1988, health advocates successfully defended another initiative, Proposition 99, against the industry front group Californians Against Unfair Tax Increases. (That was before California passed the law requiring big money behind initiative campaigns identify themselves in their advertising.)
Proposition 99 allocated 5 cents of the 25-cent tax to support the largest, most aggressive and effective tobacco control campaign ever done. Unlike past government campaigns, it did not focus on kids or smokers. The California Tobacco Control Program directly confronted Big Tobacco and educated the public about secondhand smoke nicotine addiction. It focused on the nonsmoking majority to reinforce the nonsmoking social norm.
Industry running scared
And the results were stunning: Smoking dropped so fast between 1989 and 1997 that 58,900 deaths from heart disease were prevented. And 11,000 cases of lung cancer were prevented by 1999.
By 2009, the reductions in smoking had saved Californian citizens, taxpayers and businesses $134 billion in healthcare costs.
It also cost Big Tobacco $28.5 billion in lost sales.
Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds know this, which is why they have used their muscle in the legislature to fight every penny spent on tobacco control since voters passed Proposition 99.
Indeed, they did everything they could to divert money away from tobacco prevention efforts into paying for the very medical services they trumpet in their campaign against Proposition 56. After all, treating heart attacks doesn't reduce cigarette sales.
Tax increase needed to help smokers and nonsmokers
Since 1988, inflation has eroded the value of the five cents a pack that Proposition 99 allocated to California's tobacco control program. In 1989-90, the program's first year, the Tobacco Control Program received $242 million (in 2016 dollars) compared to just $70 million now.
The result is that the program is losing its effectiveness because the impact is directly related to how much money goes to fight Big Tobacco.
At the same time, the innovative research program Proposition 99 created saw its resources drop from $41 million in 1989-90 (in 2016 dollars) to $13 million now.



							Stanton Glantz using data from  California Department of Public Health and Legislative Analyst							



Proposition 56 is the opportunity to restore lost ground on tobacco control programs.
According to the California legislature's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst, Proposition 56 provides $135 million to anti-tobacco education and $50 million to research. This money would bring funding for the anti-tobacco education to $205 million and research to $63 million, restoring 85 percent of the programs' purchasing power.
These resources, combined with the price increase that will accompany the tax, will cut smoking. Our analysis of a $1 tobacco tax that the industry (barely) defeated in 2012 estimated that the combined effect of the tax and reinvigorated anti-tobacco campaign would have cost Philip Morris, RJ Reynolds and other tobacco companies a billion dollars a year.
Improving the economy and creating jobs
Reducing smoking benefits more than health. Eighty cents of every dollar spent on cigarettes leaves California to tobacco companies (and a few farmers) back East. When people quit smoking, they don't burn the money, they spend it. And because less leaves the state, more of their money gets recycled in California, where it creates local economic activity and jobs.
The billion dollars a year that would have not been spent on tobacco had the 2012 tax passed would have led to $1.9 billion in economic activity and 12,000 new jobs.
Because Proposition 56 is a bigger tax with more money for anti-tobacco education and research it will have a bigger effect on health, reducing medical costs and building the California economy ... and cost Big Tobacco even more money.
So, I doubt that Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds are really investing tens of millions to oppose Proposition 56 because they want to see more spent on smoking reduction.
Smoke-free society is in reach
In 2014, only 11.7 percent of Californians smoked, and among them, two-thirds (65 percent) were smoking 10 cigarettes or less daily with one-third (37 percent) not even smoking every day.
If voters see through Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds' disingenuous campaign and vote Yes on Proposition 56, they will reinvigorate the state's tobacco control program. The bottom line? California could become the first state to reach former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop's vision of a smoke-free society.

VILNIUS, Lithuania, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Rheinmetall and Krauss-Maffei Wegmann will supply Lithuania's military with 88 Boxer armored vehicles as part of an approximately $441 million deal, Rheinmetall announced Monday.
The deal is set to run from 2017 to 2021, the company said in a statement.
It makes Lithuania the third NATO nation behind Germany and the Netherlands to field the high-mobility combat vehicle.
The order was placed via the Organization for Joint Armament Cooperation, and the vehicles will be configured as infantry fighting vehicles armed with a turret-mounted 30mm automatic cannon.
The 8x8 vehicle offers mobility on and off the road and is powered by a turbo-charged diesel engine, allowing it to reach speeds of more than 60 mph with a combat weight of 36.5 tons.
Germany has 405 Boxers in its inventory, while Netherlands has 200.
The vehicles have been deployed in Afghanistan.
Lithuania's military will call the vehicles "Vilkas," which means "wolf," Rheinmetall said.


WELLINGTON, New Zealand, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Saab has received the first order under a five-year deal to provide the New Zealand army with the Tactical Engagement Simulation System, the company announced Monday.
"This initial order will provide the army with a proven, off-the-shelf and technically advanced training system," Saab said in a statement.
The laser-based system draws on more than 35 years of tactical engagement simulation design, delivery and support expertise.
Saab has delivered such systems to the U.S., British, Canadian, Australian and NATO forces.
The system has been developed and regularly modernized using the experience of more than 20 customer nations.
New Zealand will lead the region in the employment of advanced laser-based tactical engagement systems to support training, Saab said.
The system offers a wide range of realistic training scenarios that will enhance the army's ability to conduct and analyze the outcomes of force-on-force exercises.


AUGUSTA, Ga., Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Raytheon has unveiled its Cyber and Electromagnetic Battle Management tool at the U.S. Army's Cyber Quest event, the company announced Monday.
The Army event informs cybersecurity requirements and priorities, Raytheon said in a statement.
The battle management tool integrates cyber and electromagnetic spectrum awareness capabilities into the service's Electronic Warfare Program Management Tool, an Army program of record since 2014.
Raytheon's new system provides a shared situational understanding of electronic warfare, cyber and management, and control of organic assets.
The tool allows electronic warfare officers to determine the best path forward without being jammed or discovered, Raytheon said.
It also allows users to jam an enemy's communication ability and disrupt the ability to use cyber emitters.
Raytheon's newest tool offers operational and life-cycle cost benefits, the company said, including increased mission effectiveness, reduced planning cycles, coordination of effects, collaboration with other elements of mission command, electronic warfare and cyber effectiveness analysis and reduced training costs.


Immigrants have become a major scapegoat in recent years for sputtering Western economies.
From the United Kingdom's jarring "Brexit" from the European Union to Donald Trump's infamous wall and more recent proposal to apply "extreme vetting" to those wishing to enter the United States, many politicians have found success by casting immigrants as a threat to the physical, social and economic welfare of natives.
In short, Americans (and our European brethren) are unhappy, and many are convinced immigration brings harm. A recent poll found that almost two-thirds of Americans think immigration, including the legal kind, "jeopardizes the United States."
While it has become a popular notion in the West that immigrants jeopardize the job prospects of natives, over 30 years of economic research (including my own) gives strong reason to believe otherwise.
And in fact, the opposite may be more likely: There's evidence immigrants actually promote more economic growth.
Why we blame immigrants for our troubles
Extensive reviews of research on the topic (like this one) show that most studies of how immigration affects native wages and employment found very little effect.
Although economists have yet to arrive at a complete consensus, decades of studies generally do not support the notion that immigration harms the economy, market wages or native employment. So why do so many believe it when research suggests otherwise?
Recent media coverage can be partly to blame, for promoting more negative images of immigrants than positive ones. One example is how there's been a lot of coverage of fraud in the H-1B visa program but relatively little of testimony by Bill Gates and others about its important benefits. And nationalistic politicians frequently drum up support by claiming immigrants are stealing our jobs.
But a deeper issue is that it is easy to think that the labor market is a zero-sum game. If everyone is competing over a finite number of jobs, more immigrants mean fewer opportunities for natives. However, the reality is much more complex, and the labor market is far from a zero-sum game.
A new migrant interested in the same job as you may diminish your odds a little, but a single immigrant with a good idea might end up creating hundreds or thousands of jobs that wouldn't have existed had he or she not crossed an ocean or border (the impact of son-of-a-migrant Steve Jobs or South African tech entrepreneur Elon Musk comes to mind).
The labor market is dynamic, and both individual workers and employers constantly readjust to changing conditions. In fact, many economists have found evidence that natives quickly adjust to the labor market forces of immigration and in a way that often yields positive benefits.
Adjusting to immigration
Immigration flows into the United States do not affect all sectors equally. Immigrants are highly overrepresented in either very low-skilled manual and labor-intensive jobs or very high-skilled science and engineering occupations.
The types of immigrants who arrive and the areas in which they work are crucial for understanding the impact, and this concentration makes it possible to adjust to it.
In a 2010 study, Dartmouth economist Ethan Lewis found that companies in regions that saw inflows of less-skilled immigrants in recent decades adopted capital machinery at a lower rate.
In other words, because businesses substituted capital for less-skilled immigrant workers, they didn't suffer harmful effects on productivity or value added per worker. This substitution lowers the pressure to reduce wages.
Economists Giovanni Peri and Chad Sparber found that inflows of immigrants â whether low- or high-skilled â induced native workers to shift to jobs that are more complementary in nature and where they have a comparative advantage. And that limited the impact on wages and employment.
For example, natives working in fields receiving large inflows of low-skilled immigrants â who had a comparative advantage in manual and physical labor â moved toward occupations requiring more communication-intensive tasks. They observed a similar phenomenon when high-skilled immigrants with comparative advantages in fields like science and mathematics enter the U.S. labor force. Rather than being laid off, native skilled workers moved to occupations that required more managerial and communication skills.
Economists George Borjas and Kirk Doran also found convincing evidence of this mobility in very high-skilled academic research positions, where native mathematicians altered their research away from topics dominated by new immigrant academics.
Just as natives move toward occupations in which they possess a comparative advantage relative to immigrants, they can also move across skill groups by acquiring education. Several economic papers, like ones by Jennifer Hunt and Will Olney and Dan Hickman, found that natives tend to acquire more education following the arrival of less-skilled immigrants. Increases in education benefit the long-term prospects of natives, and means they are no longer competing in the less-skilled labor market.
Growing the economic pie
But beyond simply doing no or little harm to natives, there's evidence immigrants actually benefit the overall economy â which helps everyone.
Recall that immigrants in the United States are highly represented in high-skill science and engineering occupations. Economists have long understood that economic growth is generated by innovation, which in turn comes from research and development. A study by Stanford economist Charles Jones found that nearly half of U.S. economic growth since the 1950s is attributable to the increase in the number of scientists and engineers engaged in research and development.
Combine this with the fact that about half of the growth in the number of scientists and engineers in the United States since the 1980s was due to immigrants and it is not difficult to understand the connection between skilled immigration and economic prosperity.
In a recent paper, coauthored with Giovanni Peri and Chad Sparber, I formally tested this idea. We examined whether increases in skilled foreign-born scientists and engineers in the United States from 1980 to 2010 improved productivity. We found modest gains in real wages for native skilled workers. And no negative impacts on native employment.
Complementing our finding is research by economists William Kerr and William Lincoln, who found that skilled immigrants increase innovation, thereby generating productivity gains for native workers most ready to take advantage of such technological advances.
As long as immigrants continue to innovate and invent, they can continue to boost economic growth.
Who is actually most hurt by immigration
Although most studies don't find adverse impacts on natives, that does not mean they have not found adverse impacts at all. In fact, the group that most commonly appears to be negatively affected by new immigrants are other recent immigrants.
Recent immigrants are the most easily substituted with new immigrants, tend to live and work in the same labor markets that new immigrants enter, often do not have the skills to move toward communication-intensive jobs and face restrictive policies that limit access to higher education. As such, their labor market prospects appear to deteriorate when new immigrants arrive.
Research suggests natives' productivity in certain occupations â ones that truly appear to be zero-sum â is also somewhat affected by immigration. For example, economists George Borjas and Kirk Doran found that the publishing rates of American math professors were negatively affected by inflows of Soviet mathematicians in the 1990s after the Soviet Union's collapse. Since the amount of papers an academic journal can publish is fixed, more quality papers from immigrants will crowd out those written by natives.
Other studies that take a general focus on the labor market and find negative effects have been debated from time to time among academics, however, with little consensus.
A new paper, however, calls into question many of these negative findings, showing researchers have been using measures of immigration that carry an inherent negative bias. Using correct measures eliminates the negative impact.
Facts are facts
All in all, most of the research suggests that the fear that immigration will drastically harm native wages and job prospects is by and large unsubstantiated. In fact, much work has shown the labor market is dynamic, and that native workers and employers take measures to evade any competitive forces from immigration.
While some pundits and presidential candidates will likely continue to claim immigration is harming our economy, that won't alter the evidence economists have uncovered in study after study. By the same token, claims that immigrants are flooding across our southern border (so we need a giant wall to keep them out) doesn't change the fact that illegal immigration to the United States has actually been falling for the past nine years.
Though it is easy to believe that foreigners will overcrowd a frail, zero-sum labor market, decades of research has shown the only thing that sums to zero are the estimated effects of immigration.

The leaders of Italy, France and Germany vowed Monday to boost joint European security efforts in the wake of Islamic extremist attacks as they made a symbolic bid to relaunch the European Union after Britain's vote to leave.
From the deck of the Italian aircraft carrier Garibaldi, which is spearheading the EU's migrant rescue and anti-smuggling effort, Italian Premier Matteo Renzi, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande also promised new economic prospects to young people - albeit without any specific proposals or details.
The three leaders travelled to the sun-soaked island of Ventotene to pay tribute to one of the founding fathers of European unity, Altiero Spinelli, and show common cause going into a bigger EU-wide summit next month in Slovakia.
Spinelli, along with another intellectual confined to Ventotene in the 1940s by Italy's fascist rulers, co-wrote the "Ventotene Manifesto" calling for a federation of European states to counter the nationalism that had led Europe to war. The document is considered the inspiration for European federalism.
Renzi invited his French and German counterparts to the island off Naples to remind Europe of its founding ideals as the EU forges ahead amid a spate of challenges, from slow economic growth to extremist violence, after Britain's vote to leave the bloc.
The three placed three bouquets of blue and yellow flowers - the colors of the European Union - on Spinelli's simple white marble tombstone before meeting for an hour privately aboard the nearby Garibaldi.
"Many people thought that after Brexit, that Europe was finished. It's not like that," Renzi said from the deck. "We respect the choice of Britain's citizens, but we want to write a page for the future."
Renzi, Merkel and Hollande all voiced support for improved internal and external defense measures, including better intelligence-sharing and beefed-up border defenses, following a spate of Islamic extremist attacks in France that have rattled Europeans' sense of security.
Renzi said such measures were an "absolute priority" for the EU going forward.
"Europe should have a framework of protection. For security we need to have borders that can be guarded," Hollande said. "We also want there to be more coordination in the fight against terrorism."
Merkel said the EU is currently facing "enormous challenges" and needed to work together especially on the security front at home and abroad.
"We feel that faced with Islamist terrorism and in light of the civil war in Syria that we need to do more for our internal and external security," she said. "Defense cooperation ... should be strengthened and the exchanges between our intelligence services must be intensified."
The three also called for greater economic stimulus measures to create jobs, especially for young people, and improve investment opportunities.
For Merkel, the visit to Ventotene marked the start of a string of meetings with other EU leaders to discuss the post-Brexit EU, with visits to Estonia, the Czech Republic and Poland in the coming days and meetings with the leaders of Slovakia and Hungary in Warsaw. Merkel has also invited leaders from the Nordic countries, the Netherlands, Austria and other eastern European nations for informal meetings at a government guest house in Germany.
"She wants to support a discussion that is as broad as possible, with as many actors involved as possible," her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said last week. That is aimed at ensuring that whatever emerges from the post-Brexit process "finds the widest possible acceptance in the member states and in the population."
Merkel has shown little enthusiasm for grandiose changes to the EU's structure, preferring to make things work better rather than embark on major structural reform. France, for its part, wants greater EU integration and Hollande is a strong proponent of joining European defense efforts as Italy wants. However the French presidential campaign is getting into full swing and is likely to unleash anti-EU sentiment.
Italy has a lot to gain from a reinvigorated EU as it copes with flat GDP, the migrant crisis and political uncertainties over a constitutional referendum this fall on which Renzi has staked his government's survival.
Monday's mini-summit will serve as a warmup for an EU-wide summit in Bratislava in September designed to chart the EU's post-Brexit way forward. It follows an initial three-way huddle by Renzi, Merkel and Hollande in Berlin in the days immediately following the June 23 British referendum.
There, the three leaders pledged their commitment to European unity and plotted a common proposal to relaunch the European project focusing on three key areas: improving security, boosting economic growth and strengthening options and programs for young people.
Charting a course is difficult until Britain formally begins the exit process, probably next year, and lays out proposals for its future relationship with the EU.

France’s former leader Nicolas Sarkozy announced on Monday that he is running again to become president in next year's elections.
“I have decided to be a candidate for the 2017 presidential election. I felt I had the strength to lead this battle at a troubled time in our history,” Sarkozy wrote in an excerpt of his upcoming book “Everything for France” (“Tout pour la France”) posted on his social media accounts.
“The five years that come will be full of danger, but also of hope,” he added.
Sarkozy, 61, served as president from 2007 to 2012, when he lost re-election to the now deeply unpopular President François Hollande.
A hyperactive and divisive figure both loved and loathed among right-wing voters, Sarkozy did not say whether he would join his conservative Les Républicains party (formerly the UMP) primaries scheduled for November.



His aides later told the AFP that he will be stepping down as the party’s leader on Monday.
More than a dozen contenders are vying for the Les Républicains candidacy, including main rival, Alain Juppé.
Sarkozy – who has made no secret of his desire to return to the presidency – has been scathing of Hollande’s security record, urging France to get tough on immigration, crack down on suspected Islamists and halt the erosion of France’s secular identity.
Courting voters tempted towards France’s growing far-right National Front party, Sarkozy has laced recent speeches with references to national identity and blames “cowardly leaders” for a loss of French culture.
His emphasis on hot-button topics of French identity and his ability to present himself as an experienced commander-in-chief at a time when France is under emergency rule may boost his chances, foreign diplomats and political analysts say.
Even so, legal troubles surrounding party financing and overspending by his 2012 presidential campaign, as well as his outsized personality,  could yet trip him up.
Sarkozy credits himself with steering Europe through its worst economic and financial crisis since the Great Depression during his 2007-2012 term.
But his abrasive manner repelled many voters and his weak performance on free-market reforms to revive the economy disappointed French business leaders.
“Everything for France” is set to be released on Wednesday.

Opponents of Libya’s U.N.-backed government voted on Monday against a motion of confidence in the Tripoli-based administration, in a rare session of the parliament based in the east of the country.
The vote is a fresh blow for the Government of National Accord (GNA), which has been seeking the parliament’s endorsement for months as it tries to extend its influence and authority beyond its base in the capital.
The vote was the first since January, when the parliament rejected an initial list of ministers put forward by the GNA’s leadership, and the first since the GNA began installing itself in Tripoli in March.
Parliamentary sessions in the city of Tobruk have been repeatedly delayed or blocked as opposition to the GNA in eastern Libya has hardened.
GNA supporters, many of whom did not attend Monday’s sitting, had previously complained that opponents used physical force and threats to prevent votes from taking place.
Spokesman Abdallah Bilhaq said 101 deputies had attended Monday’s session, with 61 voting against the GNA, 39 abstaining, and just one voting in favour.
The GNA is the result of a U.N.-mediated agreement signed in December. The deal aimed to resolve a conflict that flared up in 2014, when an armed alliance took control of institutions in Tripoli and the newly-elected parliament relocated to the east.
Western powers have been counting on the GNA to tackle Libya’s security vacuum, revive oil production, and stem the flow of migrants crossing the Mediterranean to Europe.
While forces aligned with the GNA have largely recaptured the coastal city of Sirte from Islamic State militants, the government has struggled to make an impact in other areas, losing support because of its inability to resolve a liquidity crisis, power cuts and other problems.

New clashes broke out between Kurdish forces and the Syrian army in the city of Hasakeh overnight Monday, threatening to heat up yet another front in Syria’s intractable multi-sided war. 
The fresh violence came days after Syrian war planes bombed in and around the Kurdish stronghold of Hasakeh for the first time on Thursday, forcing the US to scramble jets to halt any regime strikes that might endanger the 300 US military advisers aiding Kurdish forces.
“We've informed the Russians where we're at ... [they] tell us they've informed the Syrians, and I'd just say that we will defend ourselves if we feel threatened,” said Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend, the US commander for Syria and Iraq, in comments to CNN on Sunday.
Not since the war began five years ago has the US taken such direct measures to protect Kurdish fighters on the ground.
The escalation prompted Russia to launch a mediation bid on Sunday, and the renewed violence overnight came amid conflicting reports on whether a ceasefire had been agreed; Kurdish forces have denied Syrian military and state media reports that a deal was reached.
While the Assad regime and the Kurdish forces share a common enemy in the Islamic State (IS) group, last week’s clashes reflect the increasingly fraught state of play in a country being ripped apart by multiple opposing campaigns. Until the clashes in Hasakeh, regime forces have mainly been fighting rebels in the west while the Kurds have concentrated on IS group targets in northern Syria.
“Previously, it seemed that the Assad regime saw the Kurds as the least of its problems and hence, there was not much confrontation between the two,” said Gallia Lindenstrauss, research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Israel.
“Indeed some elements, including Turkey, even accused the Kurds of cooperating with Assad,” she told FRANCE 24.
Multi-sided conflict 
Russian and US forces are both battling the IS group in Syria but often work at cross purposes. Moscow believes a strengthened Assad offers the best counterweight to IS group advances while Washington says perpetuating the Assad regime quashes any hope of bringing long-term stability in Syria.
As allies of the United States, the Kurds have been a key part of the US-led coalition campaign in Syria and make up 60 percent of the Syrian Democratic Forces helping to fight the IS group on the ground.
But the expansion of Kurdish-controlled territory in northern Syria has wider implications for how the US and Russia pursue their joint goal of defeating the IS group, Lindenstrauss says. Russia may now increase pressure on the US to rethink its strategy against the jihadist group, especially if Turkey expresses serious objections to further Kurdish advances in the north.
Some believe that the Kurdish fighters in northern Syria have close ties to the Kurdistan Workers party (PKK), which both Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the US government classify as a terrorist organisation. Ankara fears that the Kurdish push against the IS group is partly aimed at carving out a Kurdish autonomous region along Turkey’s southern border.
So far, Turkey’s position has been to distance itself from the developments on the ground in Syria. But on Saturday, Turkey’s Prime Minister Binali Yildirim announced a possible change of tack, saying Turkey will be taking on a greater role in Syria to stop it from being split along ethnic lines.
"In the six months ahead of us, we shall be playing a more active role," Yildirim said. "It means not allowing Syria to be divided along ethnic lines ... ensuring that its government is not based on ethnic [divisions]."
Yildirim went on to reiterate that there was no future for Assad in Syria. "The United States knows and Russia knows that Assad does not appear to be someone who can bring [the people] together," he said.
"There may be talks [with Assad] for the transition. A transition may be facilitated. But we believe that there should be no [Kurdish rebels], Daesh or Assad in Syria's future," he added, using an Arabic acronym for the IS group.
“Yildirim may be implying a growing cooperation between Turkey, Russia and Iran towards a settlement of the Syrian civil war that will emphasise maintaining the territorial integrity of Syria,” said Lindenstrauss.
But Turkey-US relations could also be put to the test if Erdogan continues to reach out to Tehran and Moscow, she added.
The Kurdish question
In another sign of the growing animosity between Kurds and the Assad regime, Syria’s army recently described the Kurdish fighters as a branch of the PKK, a notion the group rejected on Saturday.
“Pro-Assad fighters see any independence movement as threatening the security of the regime,” said Muzaffer Senel, director of the Center for Modern Turkish Studies at Istanbul Sehir University.
He added that US forces’ current policy of backing Kurdish militias in Syria will not be enough to defeat either the IS group or the Assad regime. “Instead they are fostering the fragmentation of Syria,” said Senel.
Turkish-Kurdish peace talks collapsed following elections in June 2015, when the liberal and pro-Kurd People’s Democratic Party (HDP) secured 13% of the vote to deny Erdogan’s ruling AKP party its single-party majority for the first time in more than a decade. But in subsequent months a wave of terror attacks by Kurdish separatists weakened the party’s political legitimacy.
Turkish analysts like Mehmet Kaya, chairman of the Dicle Communal Research Center in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir, have called for a new round of reconciliation talks to improve the security situation inside Turkey. "Attacks in cities like Elazig, where the Turks and the Kurds coexist, are laying the foundation for a possible Turkish-Kurdish confrontation," Kaya said in an article in Deutsche Welle.  "The government must take steps to diffuse this very dangerous development and end the conflict."
Senel believes some Kurdish groups are capitalising on the prominent role Kurds have played in fighting the IS group, which “has given them the confidence to attack Turkey”, he said.
He added that US and Turkish interests are diverging on the issue of Syria, which could also further complicate Turkish-Kurdish relations.
Lindenstrauss notes that the continuing violence between all parties to the Syrian conflict and “the complexity of the situation” make it difficult to find a more coherent approach.
“Unless a complete ceasefire is achieved, there will continue to be inherent contradictions in US and other countries’ policies,” she said.

A Malian jihadist on Monday pleaded guilty to ordering attacks on historic sites in the Malian desert city of Timbuktu in 2012, in the first case of an Islamist facing international justice for cultural destruction.
Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi, a Malian national aged around 40, is the first jihadist to face charges at The Hague-based International Criminal Court (ICC) for the destruction of cultural heritage sites.
Prosecutors allege that as a member of Ansar Dine – a Malian Islamist group with links to al Qaeda – al-Mahdi ordered the destruction of nine historic mausoleums and a mosque in Timbuktu in 2012, when militant groups seized control of northern Mali.
At the hearing Monday, al-Mahdi pleaded guilty to charges of deliberately attacking religious or historical monuments.
"Your honour, regrettably I have to say that what I heard so far is accurate and reflects the events. I plead guilty," al-Mahdi told the ICC after the solo charge of cultural destruction was read to him.
The trial marks a legal milestone, which archaeologists hope will send a warning that the plundering and pillaging of the planet's ancient artefacts and sites will not go unpunished.

The groundbreaking trial comes at a time of growing international alarm over the destruction of cultural heritage sites by jihadist groups across many parts of the world.
Forgiveness from ‘ancestors of the mausoleums’
Wearing a dark suit and striped tie, al-Mahdi stood up in court while the charges were read Monday. He expressed regret over his “wrongful” acts and begged forgiveness from the people of Timbuktu.
"I seek their forgiveness and I ask them to look at me as a son who has lost his way," he said, adding that he was also seeking forgiveness from "the ancestors of the mausoleums I have destroyed".
At the start of the trial, prosecutors revealed that they had made a deal with the defence team to ask for a jail term of nine to 11 years. In return, al-Mahdi said he would not appeal.
The judges recognised this, but also warned al-Mahdi that they were not necessarily bound by the deal and he faced a maximum term of 20 years.
During his hearing, the defendant sought to distance himself from jihadists by describing their acts as "evil".
He said he wanted to "give a piece of advice to all Muslims in the world – not to get involved in the same acts I got involved in because they are not going to lead to any good for humanity".


From trainee teacher to Hisbah head
As the head of the department for upholding public virtue and preventing vice for Ansar Dine al-Mahdi ordered the attacks on the Timbuktu’s shrines, according to ICC prosecutors.
The shrines included 14 of Timbuktu’s 16 ancient mausoleums that are considered totems of idolatry by jihadists.
Born in Agoune, a village about 100 kilometers west of Timbuktu, al-Mahdi is an ethnic Tuareg who trained as a teacher. Acquaintances have described him as a quiet man who practiced an austere form of Islam alien to the West African nation. One of al-Mahdi’s former teachers told the French weekly Jeune Afrique that al-Mahdi refused to shake her hand since it was considered “un-Islamic”.
When rebel groups seized control of northern Mali in 2012, al-Mahdi joined Ansar Dine, a militant group founded by Iyad Ag Ghali, a controversial Tuareg rebel leader who once served as a Malian diplomat in Saudi Arabia, where he came under the sway of the strict, official Saudi form of Wahhabi Islam.
Prosecutors say that as the head of Ansar Dine’s Hisbah, the department for upholding public virtue and preventing vice, al-Mahdi grew frustrated when local people refused to stop worshipping at the city’s ancient shrines and ordered attacks with pickaxes, chisels and pick-up trucks.
Saving Timbuktu’s ancient texts
An ancient hub on the old Saharan trading routes, Timbuktu was a center of Islamic scholarship under several West African empires, where a syncretic practice of Islam saw the flourishing of numerous shrines and Islamic schools that housed ancient manuscripts from across the Muslim world.
When northern Mali fell to a motley mix of jihadist and Tuareg militant groups following a military coup in March 2012, archaeologists sounded warnings of the fate of the city’s cultural heritage.
Many of the ancient texts however survived until France launched a military operation to liberate northern Mali in January 2013. Credit for the preservation of numerous texts have gone to local librarians and collectors who managed to smuggle out several ancient manuscripts, as recorded in Joshua Hammer’s book, “The Bad-Ass Librarians of Timbuktu and Their Race to Save the World’s Most Precious Manuscripts”.
A milestone for justice?
While the trial has been hailed as a milestone in international justice, it has faced criticism from a number of Malians and a few human rights groups.
Some rights groups have voiced dismay that the trial was not extended to include other human rights violations.
The Paris-based rights group International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) has filed a criminal complaint in the name of 33 victims from Timbuktu in the Malian courts against al-Mahdi and 14 others, for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including sexual and gender-based crimes such as rape and sexual slavery.
"We appreciate the significance of prosecuting the destruction of cultural property but deeply regret that the charges against al-Mahdi were not widened to include crimes against the civilian population,” said the FIDH in a statement.
Conservationists however have widely welcomed the trial. UNESCO chief Irina Bokova said recently the case was close to her heart and that she "would never forget" the scenes of ransacked and damaged shrines she saw on a visit to Timbuktu in January 2013 shortly after the launch of the French-led military operation.

A blustery storm, a touch of melancholy and a sense of pride converged at the closing ceremony of the 2016 Olympics on Sunday as Brazil breathed a collective sigh of relief at having pulled off South America's first Games.
After a gruelling 17 days, Rio de Janeiro cast aside early struggles with empty venues, security scares and a mysterious green diving pool to throw a huge Carnival-like party.
Samba dancers, singers, drummers and a giant plumed macaw float mixed with hundreds of athletes in the storied Maracana stadium while a final volley of fireworks lit up the night sky.
Brazilians came to the closing ceremony happy, many wearing the canary yellow jersey of the nation's sports teams, having won two late gold medals in their two favourite sports, men's soccer and volleyball.
But Sunday served up tough weather conditions for such a big party. High winds buffeted the Maracana, power briefly went out in the upper part of the stadium, and rain drenched performers and athletes as they entered the ceremony, many with medals hanging around their necks.
To the beat of traditional Brazilian music, Olympians danced and waved their countries' flags to celebrate their place on the world's premier sporting stage.
In the last of 306 medal ceremonies, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach draped the gold around the neck of Kenya's Eliud Kipchoge, winner of the men's marathon earlier in the day.
The city handed over the Olympic flag to Tokyo, site of the 2020 Summer Games, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe appeared in the stadium dressed as popular video game character Mario, tunnelling from Tokyo to Rio.


Bach declared the Rio Games closed and expressed hope that they had left a lasting mark on the metropolitan area of 12 million people.
"These Olympic Games are leaving a unique legacy for generations to come," he said. "History will talk about a Rio de Janeiro before and a much better Rio de Janeiro after the Olympic Games."
In a final symbolic act, the Olympic flame that had burned since Aug. 5 was then extinguished in a downpour of artificial rain.
Tapping natural talent
In the midst of it worst economic recession since the 1930s, Brazil's opening and closing ceremonies relied more on the country's unique talents and natural beauty and less on expensive technology.
On Sunday, there was an ode to the white-clad lacemaking ladies and the forro music of the Northeast that sparked waves of pride among Brazilians.
One of the more stunning moments of the ceremony focused on the ancient art found in the Serra da Capivara National Park - a UNESCO World Heritage site in northeastern Brazil featuring cave paintings, some more than 25,000 years old.
But the beauty was betrayed by Brazil's tough times.
Just this week, the foundation that maintains the park said it could no longer do so because of a lack of funding.
For all the troubles before and during the Games, Rio will surely be remembered for great sporting moments.
There was the remarkable comeback of American swimmer Michael Phelps, who won five golds to reinforce his distinction as the most decorated Olympian of all time.
Jamaica's Usain Bolt drew down the curtain on his brilliant Olympic career by securing a sweep of the sprint titles for a third successive Games. And American gymnast Simone Biles, the U.S. flag bearer in the closing ceremony, kicked off her Olympic run by tying the record of four gold medals in a single Games.
But at times it was hard to focus on the sporting triumphs taking place across the sprawling city.
A low point for Rio came when Ryan Lochte, one of America's most decorated swimmers, said he was robbed at gunpoint. That ignited further security concerns after a series of assaults against government ministers, athletes and tourists.
But Lochte's story quickly unravelled, enraging Brazilians and Americans alike.
Brazilians could nevertheless take heart in the fact that there were no major mishaps or breaches after deadly attacks in Europe and the United States had prompted the biggest security operation in Brazil's history with 85,000 troops.
'Difficult moment'
"Even with all our problems we pulled off a good Olympics. Nothing too bad happened and I'd say it was better than expected," said Nivea Araujo, a Rio resident attending the closing ceremony.
For many in the soccer-mad nation, the best Olympic moments happened in the Maracana, where Brazil defeated Germany in soccer on Saturday and pieced together a widely hailed opening ceremony despite the tight budget.
Rio won the right to host the Games in 2009, when the economy was booming and millions were pushing into the middle class.
"We are in a difficult moment as a country right now, we can't hide that, but the Games were scheduled and I'm glad we could enjoy them," said Alessandro Freitas, also from Rio.
One of the major concerns for Brazilians is what will be the final cost of the Games for a country and how much they actually helped improve the city's infrastructure. Many Rio residents could not afford tickets to events, leaving them feeling on the sidelines of the city's biggest undertaking.
And come Monday, with the Games no longer a distraction, Brazil gets back to its dour reality of duelling political and economic crises. An impeachment vote in coming days could lead to the permanent ouster of suspended President Dilma Rousseff.
Interim President Michel Temer, who was booed at the opening ceremony, decided not to attend the closing event.

Two young French volunteers found dead Sunday on an island off the northeast coast of Madagascar were likely murdered, French and Madagascan authorities said.
Local mayor Bessaou Ismak Ado Crophe on the resort island of Sainte Marie told AFP that the bodies of both victims, a man and a woman in their twenties, showed signs of head trauma, with officials suspecting murder.
"They spent the evening in a nightclub and were found on the beach nearby," he said.
"I saw the bodies. Both had injuries to the head."
The two had in recent months been volunteering at Cetamada, a local environmental non-profit organisation working to protect ocean mammals.
The French foreign ministry in a statement condemned the "odious crime that claimed the lives of two French nationals".
It offered its condolences to the families and said an investigation was under way in Madagascar.
Madagascan Tourism Minister Roland Ratsiraka said he had spoken to the French ambassador to the Indian Ocean island and that the consul would be visiting Sainte Marie on Monday.
"The government strongly condemns this act and will ensure that the investigation will be transparent," he said.
Cetamada vice-president Jean-Jacques Ravello, who is also France's honorary consul to Sainte Marie island, called the incident "barbaric".
"I do not want to minimise this barbaric act, but we've been bringing dozens of volunteers here for 15 years and we've never had a problem this big," he told AFP.
He said fellow volunteers had gathered together following the incident and were "shocked psychologically".
In 2012, a French couple was found dead on a beach in southern Madagascar.
A year later, two Europeans were attacked and killed by a mob on the northwest island of Nosy Be, suspected of involvement in the death of an eight-year-old local boy.

Iran said Monday that Russian raids on Syria from one of its airbases had ended for now, shortly after accusing Moscow of "showing off" when it revealed the bombing missions.
"It was a specific, authorised mission and it's over for now. They conducted it and they are gone now," foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi told reporters in Tehran.
He left open the possibility of future Russian combat flights from Iran, saying it would depend on "the situation in the region, and according to our permission."
That came a few hours after defence minister Hossein Dehghan made a rare public criticism of Russia for revealing that its warplanes were using Iran's Hamedan airbase to attack insurgents in Syria.
"Naturally, the Russians are keen to show that they are a superpower and an influential country and that they are active in security issues in the region and the world," Dehghan told Iran's Channel 2 television.
"There has been a kind of showing-off and inconsiderate attitude behind the announcement of this news," he said.
Iran and Russia are key backers of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but Tehran has remained relatively guarded about its precise involvement in the conflict.
The Islamic republic is highly sensitive to any suggestion that it would allow foreign militaries to be based in its territory, which is outlawed under its constitution, and has emphasised that Russian planes were only refuelling in Iran.
"(Russia) needed to refuel in an area closer to the operation. That's why they used the Nojeh base (in Hamedan) but we have definitely not given them a military base," said Dehghan.
The flights from Iranian territory started on August 16. They were a major shift, significantly shortening flight-times for Russian warplanes, allowing them to carry increased firepower.
Russia said it struck targets linked to the Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra jihadist groups in Aleppo, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.
Moscow had previously used short-range craft stationed at its Hmeimim airbase outside the Syrian coastal city of Latakia, as well as ships in the Caspian Sea and a submarine in the Mediterranean, to bombard Syrian territory.
Tehran oversees thousands of troops fighting for Assad on the ground, while Russia provides airpower. Both oppose calls for Assad to step down as a way of resolving the conflict that has killed more than 290,000 people since it erupted in March 2011.

At least 54 people were killed on Saturday when a suspected suicide bomber detonated his explosives among people dancing on the street at a wedding party in the southern Turkish city of Gaziantep close to the Syria border.
President Tayyip Erdogan said it was likely that the so-called Islamic State (IS) group had carried out the late-night attack, the deadliest bombing this year in Turkey, which faces threats from militants at home and across the border with neighbouring Syria. 
Erdogan later said at a press conference that the suicide bomber was between 12 and 14 years old.
But speaking to reporters in Ankara on Monday Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said it was too early to verify the organisation responsible or whether the attack was carried out by a child.


At least 22 victims under age of 14




Turkey's Dogan news agency reported the suicide bomber had mixed in with the guests before detonating the charge. Security forces are now searching for two individuals who entered the celebration with the suspected bomber and then fled, it added.
The local governor’s office said that many of the the wounded were still being treated in hospitals around the province.
The Hurriyet Daily News said the bride and groom -- Besna and Nurettin Akdogan from the mainly Kurdish region of Siirt -- were in hospital but that their lives were not in danger.
Gulser Ates, who was wounded in the attack, told Hurriyet the attack took place as the party was breaking up.
"We were sitting on chairs, having a chat with one of our neighbours.
"During the explosion, my neighbour died on top of me. I remember being underneath. If my neighbour hadn't fallen on top of me, I would have died," she said.
Blood stains and burns marked the walls of the narrow lane where the wedding party was attacked, while women cried waiting outside the morgue for word on missing relatives.

"We want to end these massacres," witness Ibrahim Ozdemir said. "We are in pain, especially the women and children."
At least 12 people were buried on Sunday, but other funerals will have to wait because many of the victims were blown to pieces and DNA forensics tests would be needed to identify them, security sources said.
The pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party, or HDP, said in a statement that the wedding was for one of its members, and women and children had been among those killed.
Mahmut Togrul, an HDP lawmaker from Gaziantep, around 40 km (25 miles) north of the border with Syria, told Reuters it was a Kurdish wedding. The Islamic State group has been blamed for suicide bombings on Kurdish gatherings in the past as militants try to stir ethnic tensions.
Turkey is still tense after an attempted coup on July 15 which Ankara blames on US-based preacher Fethullah Gulen. He has denied the charge.

Three suspected Islamic State group suicide bombers killed 44 people at Istanbul’s main airport in June. In October last year, suicide bombers killed at least 95 people when they attacked a rally of pro-Kurdish and labour activists outside Ankara’s main train station.
Violence flared up again this week in the largely Kurdish southeast, with bomb attacks leaving 10 people dead in separate attacks, mostly police and soldiers, in an escalation that officials blamed on the PKK, Kurdish separatists militants.
The Turkish president said at a press conference on Sunday that the aim of such attacks was to sow division between different groups in Turkey such as Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen and to "spread incitement along ethnic and religious lines".
"Our country and our nation have again only one message to those who attack us -- you will not succeed!" the president added.

France's Tony Yoka completed a romantic Olympic double on Sunday, winning the super-heavyweight title just days after his fiancee had secured her own boxing gold medal.
The 24-year-old from Paris -- the first Frenchman ever to win the Olympic super-heavyweight division -- outfoxed Britain's Joe Joyce to claim a split-points decision.
After the victory Yoka sought out his fiancee Estelle Mossely, who won France's first women's Olympic boxing crown on Friday.


The couple embraced ringside after he got the narrow win before wrapping themselves in a French Tricolor.
"It's incredible, this story," Yoka said. "We dreamed about competing in the Olympics as a couple. And we dreamed about winning medals, or even gold medals. And now we've done it. Incredible."
Yoka revealed he'd received a simple instruction before the bout from Mossely.
"Estelle just said: 'I've done my job, you do yours'. It was my turn. I couldn't fail,'" Yoka said.
Yoka meanwhile said he was surprised that Joyce had not sought to vary his approach.
"He's not intelligent. Look at my face," Yoka said.
"He hit me a lot on the arms, in my gloves. And every time I struck him I hit him in the head.
"Look at the guys on the podium -- they are black and blue everywhere. Look at my face, I'm pretty good."
Turning pro
Yoka said he now plans to follow 2012 Olympic gold medallist Anthony Joshua -- the International Boxing Federation heavyweight champion -- into the pro ranks.
"I've won everything there is to win as an amateur. Four years ago Anthony Joshua was standing in my shoes," he said. "I can go as far as him, maybe even further."
Joyce meanwhile believed he had done enough to claim the decision.
"I thought the gold was mine, I'll just have to watch it again. I was landing shots on him and getting through his guard. He nicked it," Joyce, 30, a fine arts graduate, told the BBC.
"I gave it my all, got the training right, just disappointed. Silver isn't that bad but I expected the gold -- it just wasn't to be."
Joshua, who watched the bout from ringside, said Joyce deserved the win.
"The sky is the limit for him. He is a credit inside and outside the ring.
"I was just praying he would catch him with one punch. The power Joe possesses... he is a phenomenal fighter."
Joyce made the better start, landing some clumping punches to rock the Frenchman.
Yoka was more mobile but Joyce was packing the greater power in the final bout of the boxing tournament in Brazil.
Joyce was working the body frequently as Yoka seemed sluggish and unable to get his punches away.
The pair were gasping by the third and final round, with Mossely watching anxiously on from the stands.
However, a confident Yoka stuck his tongue out at the Briton seconds from the final bell -- confident he had the decision.

The United States and South Korea kicked off annual military exercises on Monday, prompting warnings of retaliation from the North, as already-heightened tension on the peninsula has been inflamed by the defection of a Pyongyang diplomat.
North Korea has become further isolated after a January nuclear test, its fourth, and the launch of a long-range rocket in February brought tightened U.N. Security Council sanctions that Pyongyang defied with several ballistic missile launches.
About 25,000 U.S. troops are joining in the Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercise, which runs until Sept 2. The U.S.-led U.N. Command Military Armistice Commission said it notified the North Korean army the exercises were "non-provocative" in nature.
The North calls the exercises preparations for invasion, and early on Monday threatened a pre-emptive strike. North Korea frequently makes such threats.
“From this moment, the first-strike combined units of the Korean People’s Army keep themselves fully ready to mount a preemptive retaliatory strike at all enemy attack groups involved in Ulji Freedom Guardian,” a KPA spokesman said in a statement carried by the North’s state-run KCNA news agency.
Last week, South Korea announced that Thae Yong Ho, the North’s deputy ambassador in London, had defected and arrived in the South with his family, in an embarrassing blow to the regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
High-level defections pointed to cracks in the Kim regime, South Korean President Park Geun-hye said on Monday.
“Recently even North Korea’s elite group is collapsing, followed by key figures defecting to foreign countries, showing a sign of serious cracks, with chances of shaking the regime further,” she told a National Security Council meeting.
North and South Korea are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.

Former industry minister Arnaud Montebourg has said he will run in France's presidential election after "wasted" years under Francois Hollande, the latest candidate on the left to challenge the government's 
pro-business line.
Ousted two years ago over his increasingly vocal criticism of Hollande, Montebourg is joining an already crowded field jostling to replace the unpopular Socialist president in May 2017.
>> Read more on FRANCE24.com: "France’s Hollande orders cabinet reshuffle amid economy row"
"I shouldn’t be here proposing an alternative because that’s what we promised four years ago," Montebourg told a rally of supporters in Burgundy on Sunday.
"But four years later we are left with a feeling of waste.  Like the majority of French it is impossible to support the current president. I am candidate for the presidency."
Unlike other rebel Socialist candidates, Montebourg, who came third in the 2012 primary winning some 17 percent of the vote, did not say whether he would take part in the party’s primaries or run as an independent left-wing candidate.
Urging Hollande not to run again, Montebourg said his project would include measures to end austerity while raising expenditure, reverse tax increases of the last five years, fight globalisation and restructure the European Union which had "practically become a failed company."
Hollande, whose approval ratings are the lowest of any French president in modern times, has said he will announce by the end of the year whether he will run again. Polls show he could still win the primary.
He has been struggling to contain an open rebellion within his party against economic reforms and some of the security measures taken in response to Islamist militant attacks.
"We no longer need managers for the collapse of the country and the system," Montebourg said.

Pope Francis on Wednesday granted French President François Hollande a private audience, three weeks after Islamist militants killed an elderly French priest by slitting his throat in front of worshippers.
Hollande, accompanied by Interior Minister Bernard Cazenueuve, flew into Rome against the backdrop of a mounting row over moves by French seaside towns to ban burkinis, an issue he described as "not for today."
Speaking after a pre-audience visit to the St Luigi dei Francesi (Saint-Louis-des-Francais), France's national church in the Italian capital, Hollande said that was not what he had come to talk about.
"I want to discuss religious freedom, secularism and unity with respect for everyone," said Hollande, who has clashed in the past with the Vatican over gay rights issues.
"French secularism's message is one which unites, not one that wounds," he said. "The Republic must defend the right to believe and also to not believe.
"When a religious figure is assassinated, the Republic is also profaned."
Hollande's gay marriage legislation was fervently attacked by the Church and a diplomatic stand-off over the Church's refusal to accept an openly gay man as France's ambassador to the Holy See was only recently resolved.
But Hollande said France had been very grateful for the Pope's solidarity following the killing of 85-year-old priest Jacques Hamel by two teenagers claiming allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) group.
"The pope's words were very comforting," Hollande said. "He confided in me that he felt like a brother at the side of the French people."
Francis and Hollande spoke by telephone hours after Hamel's murder while he was celebrating mass at his church in a town near Rouen -- Hollande's birthplace -- on July 26.
The following day, the pope said of Hamel: "This holy priest who died in the moment of offering prayers for the church is one (victim). But how many Christians, innocents, children?"
Adel Kermiche and Abdel Malik Petitjean slit Hamel's throat in front of a small group of worshippers before both were shot dead by police.
The attack, the first committed in the name of IS group against a church in the West, came less than a fortnight after a jihadist drove a 19-tonne truck into a crowd celebrating Bastille Day on the seafront in the French coastal resort of Nice, killing 85 people and wounding more than 400.
It was Hollande's second visit to the Vatican as president. His first trip was in January 2014.
Aides to the Socialist leader have said the latest trip will mark a "tightening of ties". Observers in France say Hollande is also anxious to shore up support amongst Catholic voters ahead of next year's presidential election.

Three resorts in France were poised Tuesday to join three other seaside towns in banning the burkini, the full-body Islamic swimming garment that has sparked concern about religious extremism.
Prime Minister Manuel Valls also weighed in on the debate, lashing the wearing of the burkini as "not compatible with the values of France and the Republic" and saying he supported mayors who ban it if they acted in the public good.
In the southwest, the mayor of the resort town of Leucate, Michel Py, was to sign a municipal decree later Tuesday that would ban the burkini on public beaches, the town hall said.
The decree, which runs until August 31, will bar access to public beaches to "any person who is not properly dressed, respectful of moral behaviour and secularism, hygiene and bathing safety."
"The wearing of bathing clothes which are associated with these principles is also forbidden," according to the decree, seen by AFP.
Leucate is located on the Mediterranean coast, 35 kilometres (20 miles) from Perpignan.
In the northern French department of Pas-de-Calais, the mayor of the Channel town of Oye-Plage said Tuesday he would also move to ban the burkini after seeing a woman wearing "a complete cape and gloves, covering her face and her eyes" as she headed to the beach on Sunday.
In the nearby upmarket resort of Le Touquet, local mayor and MP Daniel Fasquelle said he would also implement a burkini ban in the coming days "to fight against religious proselytising."
"There are no burkinis in Le Touquet at the moment, but I don't want the town hall to be caught offguard if we are affected by this phenomenon," Fasquelle told AFP.
String of jihadist attacks
France has been hit by a string of jihadist attacks over the last 19 months that have left the country on edge and fretting over home-grown religious extremism.
Partly as a result, the burkini has become embroiled in a fierce debate about perceived religious symbols and their place in a strongly secular country. To critics, the garment is associated with an intolerant and sectarian strand of Islam.
On July 14 Nice was the target of an attack claimed by the Islamic State group when a Tunisian ploughed a truck into crowds celebrating Bastille Day, killing 85.
And on July 26, a priest was killed in his church in northwestern France by two attackers who had proclaimed their allegiance to IS.
The following day, the Cote d'Azur city of Cannes banned the burkini and the nearby resort of Villeneuve-Loubet followed suit in early August.
Beach brawl over burkinis
The Corsican town of Sisco on Sunday became the third to introduce a ban after a brawl in a cove between locals and families of North African origin left five people injured.
A witness said the violence broke out after tourists took pictures of women swimming in burkinis on the Mediterranean island. Investigators are still probing what happened.

The first ban on the burkini has been attributed to Mandelieu-la-Napoule, close to Cannes, where it was discreetly barred in July 2013.
The text of the municipal decree has been used, typically word for word, in bans elsewhere.
Cannes mayor David Lisnard said he had signed off on the burkini ban out of "respect for good customs and secularism", a founding principle of the French republic.
But Villeneuve-Loubet mayor Lionnel Luca had a different argument, saying swimming "fully dressed... (was) unacceptable for hygienic reasons."
The bans are opposed by some, who contend they are a populist ploy, violate human rights and likely to inflame tensions.
The Collective Against Islamophobia in France (CCIF) mounted an unsuccessful legal challenge to the ban in Cannes.
It is now taking its case to the Council of State, the highest judicial authority in France for administrative matters.
But Valls, in an interview published on Wednesday with the southern regional newspaper La Provence, said he supported the ban.
"I understand mayors who, at this time of tension, respond by looking for solutions, by avoiding disturbances to public order," Valls said.
"I therefore support those who have passed (burkini) decrees if they are impelled by the will to encourage people to live together and not by ulterior political motives."
Valls added: "Beaches, like all public areas, must be protected from religious claims. The burkini is not a new range of swimwear, a fashion. It is the expression of a political project, a counter-society, based notably on the enslavement of women."
However, Valls ruled out a nationwide law to fight the burkini, saying "overall regulations on proscribing clothes cannot be a solution."

The French government has defended municipal bans on body-covering Muslim burkini swimwear but called on mayors to try and cool tensions between communities.
Three Mediterranean towns – Cannes, Villeneuve-Loubet and Sisco on the island of Corsica – have banned the burkini, and Le Touquet on the English Channel is planning to do the same.
The mainly conservative mayors who have imposed the ban say that the full-body swimsuit, which leaves the face, hands and feet exposed, defies French laws on secularism.
The burkini debate is particularly sensitive in France given deadly attacks by Islamist militants, including bombings and shootings in Paris which killed 130 people last November, which have raised tensions between communities and made people wary of public places.


France's Minister for Women’s Rights Laurence Rossignol said municipal bans on the burkini should not be seen in the context of terrorism but she supported the bans.
“The burkini is not some new line of swimwear, it is the beach version of the burqa and it has the same logic: hide women’s bodies in order to better control them,” the Socialist minister told French daily Le Parisien in an interview.
Rossignol said the burkini had sparked tensions on French beaches because of its political dimension.
“It is not just the business of those women who wear it, because it is the symbol of a political project that is hostile to diversity and women’s emancipation,” she said.
France, which has the largest Muslim minority in Europe, estimated at 5 million, in 2010 introduced a ban on full-face niqab and burqa veils in public.
Burkini brawl
On Saturday, a brawl broke out between Muslim families and a group of young Corsicans in Sisco after a tourist took pictures of women bathing in burkinis. The mayor banned burkinis on Monday.
Apart from the Paris attacks, a Tunisian deliberately drove a truck into crowds in Nice on July 14, killing 85 people, and a Roman Catholic priest had his throat cut in church by two French Muslims.
The string of attacks have made many people jumpy. On Sunday, 41 people were injured in a stampede in the Riviera town of Juan-les-Pins when holidaymakers mistook the sound of firecrackers for gunfire.
Villeneuve-Loubet mayor Lionnel Luca, member of the hardline Droite Populaire faction of the conservative Les Républicains party, said the burkini was an ideological provocation.
“Since the Nice attack, the population is particularly sensitive,” he told Le Parisien.
He said the burkini raised hygiene issues and could make rescue at sea more difficult.
The Collective against Islamophobia in France (CCIF) on Tuesday filed a complaint against the bans with the Conseil d’Etat, France’s highest administrative court, which is expected to hand down a ruling in the coming days.
CCIF spokesman Marwan Muhammad said the bans restricted fundamental liberties and discriminated against Muslim women.
“This summer we are witnessing a hysterical political islamophobia that pits citizens against one another,” he said.

France’s Université Pierre et Marie Curie (39th), Paris Sud (46th) and the Ecole normale supérieure (87th) all landed in the top 100 of the Shanghai Ranking of the world’s best universities, published Monday.
A total of 22 French schools placed in the top 500 ranking publish Monday, making France the sixth-highest ranking country, after the US, China, Germany, the UK and Australia.
The Shanghai Ranking's "Academic Ranking of World Universities", which was launched in 2003, takes into account six criteria in order to rank the top 500 of the world’s 1,200 listed universities.
Criteria include the number of former students who have earned Nobel prizes, the number of researchers who are the most-cited in their field, and the number of articles published in the journals Science and Nature.
Critics have previously said that the Shanghai Ranking stresses science over the humanities in its grading.
Universities from mainland China broke into the global top 100 in the annual ranking for the first time while Harvard remained number one for the 14th consecutive year.
China's prestigious Tsinghua University was 58th, beating elite Peking University in 71st place. The National University of Singapore also entered the top 100 for the first time, tying for 83rd.
For the top 10, Stanford maintained second place but MIT dropped from third to fifth, with the University of California at Berkeley and the UK's University of Cambridge each moving up one spot to take third and fourth.
Princeton University was sixth again, with another three US institutions – the California Institute of Technology, Columbia University and the University of Chicago – in places eight to 10.
In the Asia-Pacific region, the University of Tokyo was top at number 20 overall.


France not happy #Shanghai ranking of unis: Page 1 @lemonde cites disquiet about methodology. But so many top French researchers in US unis.— Emma-Kate Symons (@eksymons) August 16, 2012


The Shanghai Ranking is consistently largely static at its top levels, and this year nine of the top 20 were in unchanged positions, and another nine moved by only one place.
Thierry Mandon, France’s secretary Minister of State for Research, noted that France ranks higher on the Reuters ranking of the world’s most innovative research institutes: “the CEA (Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission) occupies first place, CNRS (National Center for Scientific Research) fifth place, Inserm (French Institute of Health and Medical Research) tenth pace and the Institut Pasteur 17th place”.
The biggest change was by Britain's Oxford University, which climbed three spots from 10th to seventh.
The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich was the highest-ranked entry from continental Europe, in 19th place, while the University of Copenhagen in Denmark – which came 31st – overtook France's Pierre and Marie Curie University (39th) as mainland Europe's next best, the statement said.

A beach brawl between locals and families of North African origin in Corsica, reportedly due to photos being taken of women in burkinis, resulted in protests Sunday as tensions remained high.
Saturday’s dispute erupted between members of "three families of North African origin and young locals", prosecutors said in a statement, describing the clashes as "very violent".
Witnesses said the fight started after the families objected to tourists taking pictures of women bathing in burkinis, the full-body, head-covering Islamic swimsuits. Some of those involved in the brawl were reportedly armed with hatchets and harpoons.
Prosecutors said five people, including a pregnant woman, were injured in the fighting, all of whom were later discharged from hospital.
The incident took place on a creek near the village of Sisco, in Upper Corsica.
On Sunday, the unrest spread to the island’s second city of Bastia, where hundreds of Corsicans marched on the Lupino district, which has a large North African community, chanting, “This is our home.”
Riot police could be seen barring the angry crowd from a housing estate, where some of the bathers involved in Saturday's brawl are said to live.
Third French town bans Burkini

French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve condemned the violence, and pledged a full investigation "to shed light on these intolerable deeds and to arrest those responsible".
The clashes come amid heightened tension in France after a string of attacks claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group, including the July 14 massacre in the southern city of Nice when a Tunisian ploughed a truck into crowds celebrating Bastille Day, killing 85 people.
In Corsica last December, angry protesters vandalised a Muslim prayer hall and trashed copies of the Koran after an assault on firefighters that was blamed on local youths of Arab origin.
The nearby French Riviera resort of Cannes has also sparked controversy by declaring a ban on burkinis  -- a ruling which won a court backing at the weekend. 
On Monday, Corsica's Sisco became the third French town, after Cannes and Villeneuve-Loubet, to ban the burkini from its beaches.
Sisco's Socialist Mayor Ange-Pierre Vivoni told France's BFM TV that the burkini was not acceptable in his town.
He said he was not targeting Muslims but he wanted to get rid of Islamist fundamentalists on the island.
“These people have no business here,” Vivoni said.
Islamic dress has long been a hot-button issue in secular France, where the full-face veil is banned in public places.
Last month Corsican lawmakers called on the French state to close down radical mosques on the island, hours after an underground separatist movement issued a threat against Islamic extremists.

The popular French tourist city of Cannes has banned full-body, head-covering swimsuits from its beaches, citing security reasons - a measure some are decrying as a discriminatory anti-Muslim move that only worsens religious tensions.
The ban on so-called burkinis, at the height of the French Riviera's vacation season, comes as France remains on edge after deadly Islamic extremist attacks on nearby Nice and on a Catholic church in northwest France.
A second Riviera town, Villeneuve-Loubet, imposed on August 5 a ban on the full-body swimsuit from its beaches because of sanitary reasons.
"I was informed that there was a couple on one of our beaches where the wife was swimming fully dressed," the Villeneuve-Loubet mayor, Lionnel Luca said.
"I considered that unacceptable for hygienic reasons and that in general it was unwelcome."
Cannes Mayor David Lisnard issued an ordinance in late July forbidding beachwear that doesn't respect "good morals and secularism." It notes that swimwear "manifesting religious affiliation in an ostentatious way, while France and its religious sites are currently the target of terrorist attacks, could create risks of trouble to public order."

A City Hall official said the measure, in effect until the end of August, could apply to burkini-style swimsuits. Violators risk a 38 euro ($42) fine.


The mayor calls the burkini "the uniform of extremist Islamism, not of the Muslim religion." In an interview published Friday in Nice-Matin newspaper, Lisnard said the measure could also apply to saris worn by Indian bathers, because the clothing could hamper rescuers' efforts to save them in an emergency.
The Cannes beach ban is just the latest of many French measures seen as singling out Islam, the country's second larrgest religion, in the name of official secularism.
An administrative court in Nice rejected on Saturday a plea by the CCIF, an umbrella organisation of groups against Islamophobia, to suspend the Cannes ordinance, saying that the town’s decision “respected” France’s constitutional provisions on secularism. The CCIF immediately retorted that they would appeal to the Conseil d’État, the highest administrative court in France.
Private 'burkini party' banned
Last week, the mayor of Les Pennes-Mirabeau -- a suburb of the southern French city of Marseille -- banned a women’s burkini party planned by Muslim community group Smile 13 at a local water park. The left-wing mayor, Michel Amiel, said the event would be divisive and “a provocation”.  The deputy mayor Dominique Bucci backed the ban, saying it would be a breach of the equality between men and women and "trample" on France’s secular values. Since it announced its burkini day on Facebook earlier this month, Smile 13 has received bullets through the mail.
French law already forbids face-covering veils anywhere in public, and headscarves in public schools. Proponents say the laws preserve secular values and protect women from religious oppression. But critics say they've deepened the religious divide, and Islamic State extremists say the laws are justification for attacking France.
Legal questions
The local branch of the Human Rights League warned that Cannes' burkini ban could further alienate French Muslims.
France is currently struggling to balance its cherished secular values with its multicultural society following a wave of deadly terrorist attacks claimed by the so-called Islamic State group.
The Collective Against Islamophobia in France said it's filing a lawsuit challenging the legality of the Cannes measure.
It urged tolerance, noting that Muslims made up about a third of the 85 victims of the July 14 truck attack on the Nice seafront. Two weeks later, after extremists killed a Catholic priest near Rouen, Muslims across France attended Mass in a symbol of solidarity and a denunciation of terrorism.

A French court has rejected a bid to close the 72 cafes and shops in the makeshift migrant camp in Calais, but the local government says it will continue to monitor what it calls a dangerous underground economy. 
The Lille court on Friday turned down the demand of the local government (prefecture) of the Pas de Calais region to close the operations – which humanitarian organisations contend are a lifeline for the migrants.
A statement by the prefecture said the installations do not respect sanitation rules, pose a fire risk and are a source of public disorder.  
In his ruling, which came after an expedited process, the judge said that, while the concerns expressed were "completely understandable," the “emergency conditions and public necessity required by law” to justify the expulsion of the vendors had not been met.
Social role of cafes
He also highlighted the social role of the shops, canteens and restaurants where struggling migrants can eat the cuisine of their homelands at a fraction of the cost of a meal in a French restaurant.
The French government provides some free meals, but not enough, according to aid groups.
The judge said he accepted that the outlets lacked "any administrative authorisation" and that some "do not respect the most basic sanitary rules," but that they served a valuable role as "calm meeting places for the migrants."
Maya Konforti, secretary of French NGO l’Auberge des Migrants, told FRANCE 24 that the cafes provide other, less obvious, essential services. 
“They are places to hang out during the day, to meet people, to charge phones,” she said. The cafes also often provide people arriving to the camp late at night with a free place to sleep until they can get settled during working hours.”
Despite the ruling, the prefecture said it will continue inspections and legal action against what it calls a dangerous underground economy
Local aid workers say the problems aren’t as severe as authorities portray them to be.
“The prefecture talks about hygiene problems and rotten products, but we haven’t recorded any cases of food poisoning,” said Valérie, head of communications at Utopia 56, an aid organisation working with migrants in Calais. “All these little restaurants are supplied daily with fresh products. We, the members of the organisation, eat at them regularly. Everything is cooked and recooked as it is in countries with little refrigeration.” 
Rise in camp population

The court’s ruling comes as two local charities supporting migrants reported a surprise increase in the camp's overall population.
Thousands of migrants and refugees have camped out in the Jungle, hoping to smuggle themselves aboard trucks that are crossing the Channel to Britain either through the Eurotunnel or on ferries.
According to a census conducted by French NGOs l’Auberge des Migrants and Help Refugees between August 6 and 9, some 2,000 migrants moved into the camp in July, representing a population increase of 29 percent and bringing the overall population to 9,106 people. Of those, 865 are minors, 676 of whom are unaccompanied. 


Worries about migrant children 'disappearing' 





The camp's overcrowding has increased the risk of fire and generated tensions in ever-longer queues for food and washing facilities, according to the two organisations.
The increase in the camp’s population renders the makeshift restaurants all the more necessary, aid workers say. 
The Jules Ferry day center, located near the camp, currently distributes up to 3,500 meals a day and is “incapable of ensuring food for the entire camp,” l’Auberge des Migrants warned. People sometimes have to wait as long as three hours to be fed. A Kitchen in Calais, another kitchen manned by volunteers, serves 1,500 meals a day and a typical queue is approximately 300 people.
The long lines for food can lead to clashes, as evidenced recently when an Ethiopian immigrant was killed on July 26. Furthermore, fights between Sudanese and Afghans at the end of May left 40 people injured.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives have agreed that women should be banned from wearing the face veil in schools and universities and while driving, Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said on Friday.
The move follows an influx last year of more than 1 million, mainly Muslim, refugees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, and growing security fears among the public after two Islamist attacks and a shooting rampage by a mentally unstable teenager.
Regional interior ministers belonging to Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) and her Christian Social Union (CSU) allies presented a declaration in Berlin on tougher security measures, including more police and greater surveillance in public areas.
Among the more disputed proposals is a call for a partial ban on the burqa and niqab garments. Lorenz Caffier, interior minister for the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, said the full body veil is a barrier to integration, encourages parallel societies and suggests women are inferior.
“We all reject the full veil - not only the burqa but also other types of full veil that only leave the eyes visible ... It has no place in our society,” de Maiziere told reporters.
“Baring one’s face is essential for our communication, co-existence and social cohesion and that’s why we’re asking everyone to show their faces. We want to introduce a law to make people show their faces and that means that those who breach that law will have to feel the consequences.”
The conservative interior ministers want to ensure women show their face while driving, when they register with authorities, at passport controls and at demonstrations.
They also want civil servants, teachers, students at schools and universities, judges and witnesses in court to be banned from wearing the full veil.
Centre-left coalition partner opposes move
De Maiziere said that the regional interior ministers’ declaration sent a signal that the full veil was not wanted in Germany, although it was not possible to fully ban everything that was undesirable.
The CDU proposals must be adopted by the government before they can become law. The debate over a ban on the face veil has divided Merkel’s ruling coalition; her Social Democrat (SPD) junior coalition partners largely oppose the demands.
The CDU’s calls for a partial ban come as it has lost support to the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which says Islam is incompatible with the constitution and wants to ban the burqa and minarets on mosques. The AfD is expected to perform well in regional elections in Berlin and the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in September.
SPD Labour Minister Andrea Nahles has said the calls were a sign of an « increasingly xenophobic » political discourse in Germany and could be a serious setback to efforts to integrate immigrants. Justice Minister Heiko Mass, also from the SPD, said debates about the burqa and security should be kept separate.
Germany has nearly four million Muslims, about five percent of the total population.
There are no official statistics on the number of women wearing a burqa - which covers the face and body - in Germany but Aiman Mazyek, leader of its Central Council of Muslims, has said hardly any women wear it.
A study carried out by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees in 2009 found that more than two-thirds of Muslim women in Germany did not even wear a headscarf. The niqab covers the hair and face except for the eyes.
Public debate about a ban on full body veils has broken out in several European countries since three French Mediterranean cities banned body-covering Muslim burkini swimwear, saying the burkini defies French laws on secularism.
France, which has the largest Muslim minority in Europe, estimated at 5 million, has banned the wearing of the niqab and burqa in public since 2010.

Three bomb attacks targeted security forces in eastern Turkey, killing at least nine people, mostly police officers and soldiers, and wounding several others. Turkish officials have blamed the banned Kurdish militant group, the PKK.
A roadside bomb ripped through a Turkish military convoy returning from an operation in the mainly-Kurdish province of Bitlis in the country’s troubled southeastern region Thursday just hours after two massive car bombs hit separate cities in eastern Turkey in attacks attributed to the PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party).
Three soldiers were killed in the roadside bombing in Bitlis, while a local guard was killed in clashes with Kurdish rebels in Bitlis, according to state-run news agency Anadolu.
Earlier Thursday, a massive blast hit a local police headquarters in the eastern Turkish city of Elazig, killing at least three police officers and wounding 146 people, according to local officials.
The attack in Elazig came after another car bombing on a police station in the eastern province of Van near the Iranian border late Wednesday killed a police officer and two civilians. At least 73 people, including 53 civilians and 20 police officers were wounded, according to officials.
Footage shows gutted police offices
Footage of the Elazig police station shortly after the attack aired on the CNN Turk channel showed offices  in ruins and filled with smoke after the bomb exploded just outside the complex at 9.20 am local time.
Violence in Turkey’s restive, mainly Kurdish southeastern region has increased since a ceasefire between the government and the PKK broke down last year.
Turkish security forces have launched major military operations against the rebel group in the region, sparking fears of a return to 1990s levels of violence, when the group fought a pitched fight for greater autonomy for Turkey’s estimated 15 million Kurds.
But Elazig, a conservative province that votes in large numbers for the ruling AK Party, had been spared until now.
No group has officially claimed responsibility for the bombings, but Turkish officials were quick to blame the PKK for the attacks. "The people see the real face of the PKK," said Defence Minister Fikri Isik.
Speaking to reporters after the two car bombings, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said there was no doubt they were carried out by the PKK, deemed a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.
"The (PKK) terror group has lost its chain of command. Its elements inside (Turkey) are carrying out suicide attacks randomly wherever they get the opportunity," said Yildirim.
"We have raised the state of alarm to a higher level," he said at the scene of the attack, where a crowd chanted "Damn the PKK!"

Turkey will grant early release to some 38,000 prisoners who committed crimes before July 1, Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said Wednesday, amid reports of prison overcrowding after the failed coup.
Bozdag said in a series of messages on Twitter that the move was "not an amnesty" and the convicts were not being pardoned but released on parole.
It will not apply to convicts guilty of murder, terrorism or state security crimes, or the thousands jailed after the putsch which took place on July 15.
"The regulation refers to crimes committed before July 2016. The crimes committed after July 1 2016 are outside its scope," Bozdag said.
"As a result of this regulation, approximately 38,000 people will be released from closed and open prisons at the first stage."
The timing means that it is impossible that anyone detained for complicity in the coup can be released as part of the mass parole move.
There have been reports in Turkish media that jails in the country were suffering severe overcrowding due to the influx of tens of thousands of prisoners in the wake of the failed July 15 coup.
According to Turkish officials, over 35,000 people have been detained since the coup attempt although almost 11,600 of them have since been released.
It is likely that releasing convicts not linked to the coup will make room for the alleged coup plotters who still face trials and heavy jail sentences.
Bozdag, however, did not outline his reasoning for the move.

Anjem Choudary, Britain's most high-profile Islamist preacher whose followers have been linked to numerous plots across the world, has been found guilty of inviting support for the Islamic State (IS) group.

Choudary, 49, was convicted at London's Old Bailey court of using online lectures and messages to encourage support for the banned group which controls large parts of Syria and Iraq.
Notorious in Britain where the tabloids denounce him as a hate preacher, he is also well-known abroad, making regular TV appearances in the wake of attacks by Islamist militants to blame Western foreign policy for targeting Muslims.
"These men have stayed just within the law for many years, but there is no one within the counter terrorism world that has any doubts of the influence that they have had, the hate they have spread and the people that they have encouraged to join terrorist organisations," said Dean Haydon, head of London police's Counter Terrorism Command.
Prosecutors said that in postings on social media, Choudary and his close associate Mizanur Rahman, 33, had pledged allegiance to the "caliphate" declared by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and said Muslims had a duty to obey or provide support to him.
Both men, who had denied the terrorism charges and claimed the case was politically motivated, were found guilty last month but their convictions could not be reported until Tuesday for legal reasons. They are due to be sentenced in September and could face a jail sentence of up to 10 years each.
Choudary, the former head of the now banned organisation al-Muhajiroun, became infamous for praising the men responsible for the 9/11 attacks on the United States and saying he wanted to convert Buckingham Palace into a mosque.
Despite his often controversial comments and refusal to condemn attacks by Islamists such as the London 2005 bombings, Choudary has always denied any involvement in militant activity and had never been previously charged with any terrorism offence.
Rahman served two years in jail for encouraging followers to kill British and American troops in Afghanistan and Iraq during a protest in 2006.
Breeding ground for militants

Born in the UK to parents of Pakistani descent, Choudary was a lawyer and one-time head of the Society of Muslim Lawyers. His extensive knowledge of British law enabled him to tread a legal fine line with his incendiary speeches.
He co-founded al-Muhajiroun in the late 1990s with Syrian-born Islamist cleric Omar Bakri Muhammad, who was banished from Britain in 2005.
Police said it was suspected of being the driving force behind the London bombings while Michael Adebolajo, one of the men who hacked to death British soldier Lee Rigby on a London street in 2013, had attended protests Choudary had organised.
Last year, the trial of a teenage Muslim convert found guilty of plotting to behead a soldier in London was told he had fallen in with al-Muhajiroun.
The group's influence is said to extend far beyond Britain. Those connected to it include Abu Hamza al-Masri, jailed for life in the United States last year for terrorism-related offences.
Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the gunman who shot and killed a soldier in Canada's capital and then stormed parliament in 2014, followed Choudary on Twitter, although the preacher told Reuters at the time he had no links to him.
"Over and over again we have seen people on trial for the most serious offences who have attended lectures or speeches given by these men," Haydon said in a statement.
Both Choudary and Rahman say they abide by a "covenant of security" which forbids Muslims from carrying out attacks in non-Muslim lands where their lives and wellbeing are protected.
"We're living in a global community and no doubt Muslims around the world who have their eye on what's happening in Syria and Iraq or want to know about the sharia (law) will come across us at one point or another," Choudary told Reuters in 2014.
"That does not mean that we're encouraging people to carry out any acts of terrorism."
A force on social media
Choudary had a considerable following on social media, enabling him to extend his influence worldwide. His Twitter account has more than 30,000 followers.
British authorities failed to shut down the radical preacher’s Twitter and YouTube accounts because the government had no power to force corporations to remove material from the Internet even if it was believed to have fallen foul of UK anti-terror laws, according to UK daily The Guardian.
Facebook however did agree to a request to delete Rahman’s profile in August last year. 
During the trial at the Old Bailey, legal teams considered over 20 years' worth of material over more than 333 electronic devices containing 12.1 terabytes of storage data.

Prosecutors in western Turkey have demanded a life sentence for U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey accuses of masterminding the failed coup, the state-run news agency reported Tuesday.

Concluding a yearlong investigation into his movement's financial dealings, prosecutors in the city of Usak demanded that Gulen be punished with two life sentences plus 1,900 years in prison, the Anadolu Agency reported.
In the more than 2,500-page indictment accepted by the court in Usak on Tuesday, Gulen and 111 other suspects are accused of transferring funds obtained through charities or donations to the United States via "front" companies, Anadolu said. It said the indictment also makes reference to Gulen's alleged role in the July 15 coup.
Gulen, a former Erdogan ally who lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania, is already on trial in absentia in Turkish courts, facing life terms over accusations of plotting to overthrow the government and leading an armed group.  He has also been indicted on a charge of leading a terror organization and faces another trial in absentia in November.
On Tuesday, police in Istanbul launched simultaneous raids on 44 companies suspected of providing financial support to Gulen's movement while authorities issued warrants to detain 120 company executives, Anadolu reported. The private Dogan news agency said the companies searched included a supermarket chain.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has refused to rule out bringing back the death penalty in order to punish the coup plotters - a move that would further jeopardize Turkey's faltering European Union membership bid. But on Tuesday, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim appeared to move away from reinstating capital punishment.
"Anyone who spilled the blood of our martyrs will be held to account. But, my valuable citizens, we won't act in the spirit of vengeance," Yildirim said during his weekly address to his ruling party's legislators. "Death penalty is death for one time. But there are worse ways of dying. This is through an objective and fair trial."
Meanwhile, Turkey made a formal request to Greece for the extradition of eight Turkish officers who fled to the neighboring country after last month's attempted coup, the state-run news agency reported Tuesday.
A Justice Ministry file had been delivered to Greece requesting the officers' return over charges that include breaching the Constitution through the use of force, plotting to kill the president and crimes against the parliament and government, Anadolu reported.
The six pilots and two engineers fled to Greece aboard a military helicopter after the July 15 attempt. Turkey wants them returned to stand trial on charges of participating in the violent attempt by renegade officers within the Turkish military that resulted in at least 270 deaths. Parliament was bombed, while Erdogan escaped an attack on his hotel at a seaside resort.
The eight deny involvement in the coup and have applied for asylum, saying they fear for their safety amid widespread purges in the aftermath of the attempted overthrow of the government.
The government says the coup was the work of followers of Gulen's religious movement, who allegedly have infiltrated the military over the years. The government declared a state of emergency and launched a massive crackdown on Gulen's supporters in the aftermath of the coup, raising concerns among European nations and human rights organizations who have urged restraint.
Some 35,000 people have been detained for questioning and more than 17,000 of them have been formally arrested to face trial, including soldiers, police, judges and journalists. Tens of thousands more people with suspected links to Gulen have been suspended or dismissed from their jobs in the judiciary, media, education, health care, military and local government.
Gulen has denied any prior knowledge or involvement in the coup.

Ankara has said that the deal whereby Turkey stems the flow of illegal migrants to the European Union will be torn up if the bloc does not grant Turks visa-free travel in the EU. 
Turkey’s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was asked by Germany’s Bild newspaper whether the thousands of refugees in Turkey would be allowed to head to the EU if the visa issue was not resolved, and he said: "I don't want to talk about the worst case scenario – talks with the EU are continuing but it's clear that we either apply all treaties at the same time or we put them all aside."
Visa-free access to the EU – the main reward for Ankara's collaboration in stopping hundreds of thousands of migrants getting into Europe – has been subject to delays due to a dispute over Turkish anti-terrorism legislation and Ankara's crackdown after a failed coup.
Before conceding visa liberalisation, Brussels wants Turkey to soften its anti-terrorism laws. European Commissioner Guenther Oettinger has said he does not see the EU granting Turks visa-free travel this year due to Ankara's crackdown after the failed military coup.
Cavusoglu said the treaties signed with the bloc laid out that all Turks would get visa freedom in October, adding: "It can't be that we implement everything that is good for the EU but that Turkey gets nothing in return."
A spokesman for the European Commission was not immediately available to comment on Cavusoglu's comments.
Last week Selim Yenel, Turkey's ambassador to the EU, said efforts were continuing to find a compromise with the EU on visa liberalisation and he thought it would be possible to handle this in 2016. He rejected the idea that visa-free travel may be pushed back further beyond October, after missing an initial June deadline.
EU 'humiliating' Turkey

EU-Turkish relations have soured since the coup attempt against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, with Europe alarmed by Ankara's subsequent crackdown.
Erdogan has said he would approve the restoration of the death penalty if parliament voted for it, a move which would sink any hopes of European Union membership.
Turkey has angrily rejected EU criticism that the purges might violate the rights and laws expected for them to qualify for the visa-free travel agreement and accelerated negotiations for bloc membership.
In the Bild interview Cavusoglu said Europe was acting as if Turkey had already introduced the death penalty. He said he was against introducing it, but that emotions were riding high in post-coup Turkey and the people could not be ignored
"The Turkish people are traumatised" by the failed putsch, Cavusoglu told the German daily. "Rather than helping Turkey, (European nations) are humiliating us," he added.
According to Cavusoglu, Turkey has made intense efforts, "like few other nations, to fulfill the conditions of accession to the EU". In return, Turkey has received "only threats, insults and a total blockage" from the 28-nation union, he added.
Asked if Turkey would leave NATO, Cavusoglu said anti-Turkish groups had raised this issue and added that Ankara was one of the biggest supporters of the Western defence alliance.
"But it's clear that we also need to cooperate with other partners on buying and selling weapon systems because some NATO partners refuse to allow us to sell air defence systems for example or to exchange information," he warned.

A team of EU anti-terror specialists will arrive in mainland Greece this month to track down would-be jihadists in Greek migrant camps. Some of the jihadists behind the November 2015 Paris attacks entered Europe by posing as refugees in Greece.
The deployment will consist of around 30 European police officers and is part of a “permanent cooperation between Greek authorities, their European counterparts and Europol", a Greek police source told national daily Kathimerini on Saturday.
The expert team from the European police agency Europol will be tasked with identifying individuals who could be in the process of being radicalised.
Europol spokesperson Alexandru Niculae told FRANCE 24 that the team will be involved in secondary security checks rather than first-line border control.
“In a nutshell, Europol cross-checks data submitted by its partners against data held in specialist counter-terrorist and other Europol databases,” said Niculae.
Europol  exchanges information with EU member states and shares in analysis.
While earlier anti-terror operations have concentrated on the "hotspot" migrant registration camps on the Greek islands near Turkey, this mission will focus on the dozens of camps on the mainland.
At least two of the jihadists who carried out the November 2015 Paris attacks slipped into Europe by posing as Syrian refugees in Greece, sparking fears that more extremists could be using the migration crisis to do the same.
Greece was hit by a massive wave of migration in 2015. More than 47,000 migrants – most of them Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans – remain in Greek camps, their journey through Europe delayed since the Balkan countries closed their borders last winter.
The number of migrant arrivals has dropped significantly, however, since a controversial deal in March between the EU and Ankara in which migrants are sent back to Turkey if they fail to apply for asylum or their claim is rejected.
But recent reports suggest numbers may again be on the rise.
Greek Migration Policy Minister Yiannis Mouzalas downplayed concerns, however, noting that the numbers are manageable and that Turkey appears to be honouring its agreement with the European Union.
“We have a daily average of 80-100 people and that has roughly been the average since the beginning of the agreement,” Mouzalas told Kathimerini.

Germany’s interior minister has proposed tough new security measures including deporting foreigners and revoking citizenship after two attacks claimed by the Islamic state group.
At a press conference on Thursday Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière outlined plans to beef up federal security forces, make the promotion of terrorism a crime and strip German citizenship from dual nationals who fight for foreign militias.
After terrorist attacks on German soil this year, two of them by migrants, the minister has been under intense pressure from both the political right, who want fewer Muslim migrants, and the left, who’ve been calling for a stronger police presence.
“A lot of people ... are worried about further attacks. That is understandable," De Maizière told reporters. "No one can guarantee absolute security, but we must do what is possible."
'Politically reasonable'

Revoking German citizenship would go some way towards dealing with the estimated 820 Germans fighting in Syria and Iraq who may pose a threat on their return to Germany.
It’s nonetheless considered a controversial proposal with Green lawmaker Volker Beck among those condemning it as “desperate activism”.
Social Democrats (SPD) chief Sigmar Gabriel said his party  -- the government’s junior coalition partner -- are not open to just "any populist quick fix", but that they are "ready for discussions on anything that can contribute to reinforcing security".
And the security package has yet to be approved by the country's right-left coalition and German parliament.
Deportations
Beyond the issue of homegrown terrorism, the minister is proposing to make it easier to deport terror suspects and detain foreigners who have committed crimes or are a public security risk.
A tightening of German and European Union weapons laws is also on the cards.
De Maizière said he was limiting himself to policies that could be implemented quickly, and that he considered "politically reasonable".
Raffaello Pantucci, Director of International Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told FRANCE 24 that he supported the removal of citizenship as a practical measure.
“If a person is not conducive to being a valuable participant of society then it’s logical to take these people out of the stream. But it has to be used judiciously.”
Scoping social media

The policy proposals include a new unit to combat cybercrime and terrorism, with the government also considering screening the public social media profiles of people being admitted into the country under resettlement programmes.
Security experts and authorities are well aware that Facebook and other social media are used by extremists to recruit jihadists and spread propaganda.
The suicide bomber at Ansbach music festival where 15 people were killed in July had six Facebook accounts in which he used one to distribute Islamist propaganda under an assumed name, whilst the 17 year old Afghan who attacked train passengers with an axe had two Facebook accounts.
These measures may prove difficult to implement, however, as in the past German politicians have accused organisations like Facebook of refusing to cooperate with requests for data sharing.
Pantucci told FRANCE 24 that he agrees social media organisations need to take more responsibility.
“It’s amusing that these companies become agitated over requests made for data when they use data themselves for targeted advertising,” he said.
“But in one sense they’re right because the government shouldn’t have unfettered access to just any information.”
Bring in the army

On the ground, De Maizière’s plan includes spending on security to be raised by two billion euros ($2.2 billion) by 2020, with a special division set up within federal police forces to better coordinate security efforts.
This is in addition to Chancellor Angela Merkel's controversial call during her summer press conference for the military to participate in joint anti-terror exercises with the police.
But putting soldiers on the streets has triggered alarm in a country still haunted by its Nazi past.
A poll by the Die Zeit weekly found that 66 percent of the population did not think that deploying the army in Germany was a good idea.
Even the police voiced disapproval with the chairman of the police union GdP, Oliver Malchow, saying that "the armed forces are completely unable to offer the help that we need."
"We need investigators, we need policemen who are trained constitutionally," he said.
A ban on full face veils worn by Muslim women was widely speculated to be part of the minister’s security package, but he shut down speculation saying it was “constitutionally problematic”.
De Maizière will meet his counterparts regarding the measures on August 18.

BEIRUT, Lebanon — Omran Daqneesh, a small Syrian boy from the embattled rebel-held section of Aleppo, somehow snapped to attention millions of people around the world, who watched and shared the arresting video of him as he wiped dried blood and thick soot from his face.The widespread interest in 5-year-old Omran surprised the doctors who treated him, the photographer who shot the video and many Syrians who wondered whether the world had only just discovered how children have suffered every day in a war that has raged for more than five years.On Saturday, Omran’s 10-year-old brother, Ali, died of wounds he suffered during the same attack, medical workers said. Ali’s death, which did not draw the same instant social media outpouring as Omran’s suffering, only underscored how many Syrian children are dying under the radar of the wider world.

The Syrian Boy Pulled from the Rubble in Aleppo


Omran Daqneesh, 5, was rescued after an airstrike in the Syrian city of Aleppo. Within hours, a photo of his dust- and blood-covered face captured the world's attention. This is the story behind the image.

Omran was injured on Wednesday by either a Syrian or a Russian airstrike — Russia has denied involvement — that destroyed the building where his family lived in eastern Aleppo. On Thursday, a pro-government website published a photograph of a young girl that it said was hurt — around the same time as Omran — by rebel mortar attacks on the government-held western side of the city.The rebels have no air power, and the devastation in Aleppo has been greater on the rebel-held side. One monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said that 100 children had died on the city’s eastern side this month alone, and 49 on the western side. For each family, the loss is immeasurable. And there are children constantly caught up in battles in other places, on all sides, across war-torn Syria.
Omran’s picture has resonated for reasons obvious and unknowable. Here are images of seven of the many other children treated in the past week at hospitals in the same region. They are taken from among several that were posted by doctors and other residents of Aleppo on a WhatsApp group for journalists.Ahmad Tadifi, 2

Doctors did not know who this child was when he arrived at the same hospital that treated Omran. On Wednesday, Ahmad had been separated from his family — as happens to many children in the chaotic aftermath of an attack — in the Mashhad neighborhood of Aleppo.He underwent surgery for serious injuries to his head, groin and right arm and leg. Later identified, Ahmad was kept in the intensive care unit of the hospital along with his father.Late on Friday, he died from his injuries.Rouwaida, 5, and Rana Hanoun, 7 months

The Hanoun sisters were wounded on Wednesday in the same airstrike that injured Omran. They were among 12 children under 15 who were treated at the same hospital in Aleppo. Both of the girls had suffered shrapnel wounds, but were treated and then released on Thursday morning. Doctors shared their picture with the WhatsApp group around the same time they shared the photograph of Omran.

Aisel suffered wounds to her head and to one of her legs on Tuesday, and was treated at Al Quds hospital. The severity of her injuries could not be confirmed because doctors were busy treating new cases. But activists have nicknamed her “Syria’s Cinderella” because of a picture that one took of her shoes — Mary Janes, worn with white socks.

He was treated on Tuesday night at the Omar Hospital and released, said Baraa al-Halabi, a citizen journalist who photographed him. None of the medical workers who could be reached remembered the boy, which is not unusual in the overwhelmed hospitals.

Four children, no pictureAt 3 a.m. Saturday, a barrel bomb landed on a house in the Jalloum quarter of Aleppo’s old city, destroying the house and killing seven members of one family — including all four children — said Abdelkafi al-Hamdo, a friend of the father’s. The children were Aisha, 12; Mohammad, 11; Obaida, 7; and Afraa, 6. There is no picture of their injuries to show because they were pulled dead from the rubble. Their father, Ali Abu Joud, recorded this video of three of his children’s bodies wrapped in shrouds. His voice can be heard breaking as he tells them goodbye, calling them “habibati” — my darlings — “birds of heaven, gone to the one who is better, gone to God.”

“Yes, the Olympic Village will be something for rich people,” Mr. Paes said. “But there’s no shame in that.”

In a sign of the anger over the Games, a media bus was attacked on August 9 in an area torn apart for Olympic projects. But some analysts agree with Mr. Paes that the Games will not leave the city with significant debt.In a report issued in May, Moody’s said that the Games would have a negligible impact on the city’s ailing economy but that the $7 billion in transportation-related spending was money well spent.
That assessment stood in stark contrast to the benefits seen in the estimated $11 billion that Brazil spent hosting the 2014 World Cup, which left behind a constellation of 12 new or renovated stadiums, most of which are not used regularly.Parsing the numbers can be tricky, of course, and Olympic hosts often fiddle with budget categories to conceal the true costs.Bent Flyvbjerg, an Oxford University economist and the lead researcher on a study that examined Rio’s Olympic finances, said the actual amount spent on sports venues was most likely $4.6 billion, 51 percent over budget.That amount, Mr. Flyvbjerg said, placed Rio somewhere in the middle of host cities that have exceeded their spending projections.“All governments try to take the most convenient truth and spin it for their own purposes,” he said. “I guess if I was doing P.R. for the mayor of Rio, I’d also say we’re doing better than the previous three Olympics.”In recent years, Oslo, Boston and Munich, bowing to popular opposition, have dropped their Olympic ambitions. Over the last three decades, nearly every city that has hosted the Games has lost money, and few expect Rio to recoup the billions of dollars spent preparing for an event that lasts just weeks.“Fewer and fewer cities are willing to host the Olympics because they are a tremendous waste of resources,” said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College and the author of “Circus Maximus: The Economic Gamble Behind Hosting the Olympics and the World Cup.” “There’s no sensible way to rationalize the expenditures that have gone into this.”The amount of money lost to waste and corruption may never be known. Sérgio Cabral, the former governor who helped land the Olympics, has been accused of demanding millions in bribes. It also remains to be seen whether the 12 Olympic venues intended to become schools or community sports centers will end up as white elephants.

But city officials say the Olympics helped move the needle on infrastructure plans that had languished for years.
In some poor neighborhoods, the Olympics served as a cudgel to speed the overhaul of public clinics that had been plagued by long waits and poor service. At one, in the troubled City of God favela, software now streamlines the triage process, a cheery ombudsman takes complaints and a new app lets supervisors track how long doctors spend with each patient — or whether they take inordinately long lunch breaks.“It’s like night and day,” said Elizabeth Rezende, 61, a retired maid waiting to get her electrocardiogram results after experiencing chest pain. “The other emergency hospitals are so chaotic.”Then there is Meu Porto Maravilha, or My Wonderful Port, the historic waterfront that for decades was cut off from downtown Rio by a hulking elevated highway, its 19th-century warehouses left to molder. Plans to rehabilitate the port, first put forth in the 1980s, had long been stymied by a lack of money and insufficient political will.The $2.5 billion rehabilitation, much of it financed through the sale of air rights from adjacent properties and tax incentives to developers, included demolishing the viaduct and funneling traffic through a new three-mile tunnel.Over the next decade, the developers plan to build 500 apartments that they say will be affordable to residents of a nearby favela. Many of these residents are descendants of the half-million African slaves who first arrived in Brazil at Valongo Wharf. The wharf’s recently unearthed foundations are scheduled to become part of a museum that will also include a forgotten slave cemetery.“If we didn’t get the Games, I’m not sure this would have happened in our lifetime,” said Alberto Silva, who is in charge of the project.Since opening in May, the port has been a hit with Brazilians, who crowd the waterfront promenade day and night, drawn by free concerts, food trucks and the opportunity for selfies in front of the Olympic flame.
As she made her way through the elbow-to-elbow throngs, Maria Helana Lima, 49, a house cleaner, said she had initially shared the skepticism of friends who viewed the Games as a colossal waste of money.

“It’s hard to get excited about the Olympics when our hospitals are so overcrowded and people can’t find jobs,” she said. But sitting in the shadow of a new science museum by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, Ms. Lima said she had changed her mind.“I’m sure there was a lot of corruption and waste that went into this, but the end result is gorgeous and really cool,” she said. “This is definitely a place I’m going to come back to again and again.”

In New York, officials plan to order up to 750 of the cars to run on the subway’s lettered lines. The higher capacity trains are part of a broader push to ease crowding. The authority is also updating the signal system so that trains can run closer together and expanding the system with projects like the Second Avenue subway line, which is scheduled to open on the Upper East Side in December.The state-run transportation authority had planned to buy only 10 open gangway cars, but moved to expand the order after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, asked it to look at ideas from around the world, said Veronique Hakim, president of New York City Transit, the authority division that runs city subways and buses. The agency plans to work with the builder to make sure the cars arrive “as soon as possible,” she said.

“When you look at other large systems — Paris, London, Toronto — you can really see and appreciate that these open-end car designs provide additional space,” Ms. Hakim said in an interview.To make it easier for riders to enter the cars, the new trains will have 58-inch doorways, up from 50 inches, though Toronto’s doorways are 64 inches. (To be fair, Toronto’s system is far from perfect; it still accepts tiny tokens while New York retired the coins more than a decade ago.)Toronto’s reputation as a livable city with good transit has helped it grow to more than 2.8 million people, on par with the population of Chicago. Toronto’s transit system — the third largest in North America — has about 1.7 million riders each weekday on its network of subways, streetcars and buses, but those figures are dwarfed by New York City’s nearly 6 million daily subway riders.Toronto’s transit system is facing major crowding challenges and uncertainty over funding. The city has three main subway lines, and its busiest, the Yonge-University line, is regularly packed at rush hour, mirroring conditions on New York’s busiest lines.
Steve Munro, a longtime transit advocate in Toronto, said that the new cars had helped with crowding, but that the city should have built new subway lines to handle the rising demand decades ago.“By the time you realize you need the new trains, you already have a crowding problem, and there is a backlog of demand that will immediately fill the new capacity,” Mr. Munro, 67, said at a cafe near the busy Bloor-Yonge station.Mr. Munro, Toronto’s version of Gene Russianoff, New York City’s prominent voice for subway riders, cautioned that even with the new cars, trains would still be very crowded.Some riders in New York have raised concerns that regular subway annoyances — from “showtime” dancers to misbehaving riders — might now become the whole train’s problem, instead of being contained to one car.Andy Byford, the chief executive of the Toronto Transit Commission and an enthusiastic evangelist for improving the system, dismissed those fears, saying riders could easily escape unpleasant situations in the new cars.

“You’re not then trapped in a single carriage,” Mr. Byford said from his office atop the Davisville station north of downtown Toronto. “You can get up and move.”If a rider urinates or vomits, someone could simply walk away, rather than waiting for a station and darting from one car to another. Shameen Miller, 33, said that was how she responded when she came across a man emitting a foul odor.“Think about it — their smell is not going to drift all the way down,” Ms. Miller said.One downside is that if a train has a technical problem, workers must remove the entire six-car train from service, Mr. Byford said, instead of separating a pair of cars and replacing them. But over all, he said, the benefits have outweighed the drawbacks.
As major cities around the world have switched to open gangway subway cars, American cities have been reluctant to try them. Yonah Freemark, a transit blogger in Boston who created a map of all the cities where the trains are used, called the delay a case of “American exceptionalism in a really bad way.”New York’s decision to buy the cars was a major step, especially because the authority has been slow to adapt to technology, like countdown clocks or a new fare payment system.“It exhibits that the agency is moving into the 21st century when it comes to trains,” Mr. Freemark said.American transit officials have had reservations about whether the design could work on the nation’s aging subways and whether ridership levels warrant the expense of switching to the new cars, said Randy Clarke, a safety and operations expert at the American Public Transportation Association. In Boston, subway officials considered the idea for new cars on two lines but decided against it.Officials in New York have worked with engineering consultants on the plans and are confident the design is feasible, even though the subway is an older system, Ms. Hakim said.

In Toronto, the best sign of the cars’ popularity is that riders whose lines do not have the trains are pleading for them. Sygmund Gaskin, 45, said he wished the older trains on his Bloor-Danforth Line could be replaced with the new cars.“I don’t know why it takes so long to get them for this line,” he said. “How come we don’t have them here as well?” Continue reading the main story

BAGHDAD — Hatam Kareem received the telephone call on Sunday that he had been waiting for, saying the men who killed his brother had been executed by hanging.“It was the happiest call I have ever received,” he said.Thousands of other Iraqis shared his happiness on Sunday over the executions of 36 men convicted and sentenced to death for taking part in the Islamic State’s massacre of roughly 1,700 Shiite military personnel in 2014.The massacre, at the Camp Speicher air base near Tikrit, Saddam Hussein’s hometown, is the deadliest atrocity to date carried out by the Sunni militants of the Islamic State, either in Iraq or in Syria. The crime galvanized Iraq’s historically oppressed Shiites, who have been in power since the 2003 American invasion, and took up a place in their collective memory alongside the atrocities Mr. Hussein inflicted on them.Video images of the massacre that were made and released by the Islamic State showed killing on an industrial scale, with one man after another being shot in the head and pushed into the flowing waters of the Tigris River. Other victims were killed on land and buried in mass graves. A survivor, speaking to The New York Times in 2014, described how he heard a bullet whiz past his head, then played dead in a pile of bodies and hid out for three days among the reeds along the river.Iraqi forces recaptured Tikrit from the Islamic State in 2015, and the riverbank became a site of pilgrimage, visited by relatives of victims from mainly Shiite southern Iraq.
Iraqi officials said that the 36 convicts were executed on Sunday at a prison in Nasiriya in the south. The death chamber was crowded with the families of Camp Speicher victims who were invited to watch the executions. The convicts were hanged one by one, as women wailed and howled, their tears of joy mixing with tears of sadness, and men hugged each other in celebration, according to a prison official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.After the completed executions were announced, Sabah Radhi, whose brother was killed at Camp Speicher, said: “Today is the day of victory for all of us, the day where happiness has entered our broken hearts. We have been waiting for this day since the massacre, and it’s finally come true.”

Surviving an ISIS Massacre

Mr. Radhi said that as soon as he heard the news, he called his uncle, who lost a son at Camp Speicher. “He was very happy,” Mr. Radhi said. “He felt that the Iraqi justice system has taken revenge for his son.”The convictions and death sentences were handed down this year. After an Islamic State bombing in Baghdad last month killed roughly 300 people, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi promised to speed up executions of convicted Islamic State terrorists.Activists have long criticized Iraq’s use of the death penalty because of the problems plaguing the country’s justice system and the number of convictions based on testimony from confidential informants, without any physical evidence. Human rights groups have also documented cases of confessions obtained by torture inside Iraqi jails.“The criminal justice system remains critically flawed in Iraq,” Amnesty International wrote in a report in July. “Trials, particularly of defendants facing charges under the antiterrorism law and possible death sentences, can be grossly unfair, with courts often admitting torture-tainted evidence, including when defendants recant their ‘confessions’ in court.”Mr. Abadi’s promise to fast-track executions drew sharp criticism from the United Nations. “Given the weaknesses of the Iraqi justice system, and the current environment in Iraq, I am gravely concerned that innocent people have been and may continue to be convicted and executed, resulting in gross, irreversible miscarriages of justice,” Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement issued this month. “Fast-tracking executions will only accelerate injustice.”Iraqi officials see things differently, and said on Sunday that the executions were the result of fair trials and that the sentences had been approved by the president in accordance with Iraqi law.
“This is simple restitution to the martyrs’ families,” said Yahiya al-Nasiri, the governor of Dhi Qar Province, where the executions took place. “Today, the Iraqi judicial system did its work. Today is an important day for the families, to see the people who killed their sons executed in front of their eyes.”Not all relatives of the Camp Speicher victims expressed satisfaction with the executions. Many believe that the massacre victims, who were mainly low-ranking military recruits, were abandoned and betrayed by senior officers when the Islamic State militants advanced on the air base.“I’m not interested in the execution of these people,” Khalaf Edan, who lost a son at Speicher, said on Sunday. “I would be happier if I attended the execution of one of the military commanders who caused this massacre.”

There was Lassana Bathily, a Muslim immigrant from Mali, who hid shoppers in the basement of a kosher grocery store outside Paris two days after the Charlie Hebdo attack, then smuggled them out as the terrorist Amedy Coulibaly held people hostage upstairs.In Villejuif in April last year, a fitness instructor and mother, Aurélie Châtelain, 32, refused to hand over her car to Sid Ahmed Ghlam, who the authorities say planned to gun down a crowd at a suburban church. Her refusal ended with both of them being shot in a tussle, and she died. When Mr. Ghlam called the police for help, he was arrested. He remains in prison and contends he did not shoot her.Ms. Châtelain received the Légion d’Honneur posthumously after her family and friends pointed out that if those who stopped a gunman presumed to be on the verge of an attack on the high-speed Thalys train running from Amsterdam to Paris deserved France’s highest award, so did she.The attempted attack on the train occurred almost exactly a year ago, when a shirtless man emerged from a train bathroom with a Kalashnikov assault rifle and a Luger pistol. Three Americans who  stopped him have been decorated by France’s president, along with a Briton and a French-American man, Mark Moogalian, who was the first to grab the gunman, Ayoub El Khazzani. Mr. Moogalian was shot in the process but survived. The intervention of the men stopped what could have become a slaughter.On Nov. 13, 2015, when extremists tied to the Islamic State attacked a theater, a stadium and restaurants in and near Paris, a number of people made extraordinary efforts to help each other. One was Ludovic Boumbas, a 40-year-old of Congolese descent, who lived in Lille and was celebrating the birthday of a waitress at the bar-cafe La Belle Équipe when armed men began firing on them. He jumped in front of a young woman who was at the party and was fatally shot; she was wounded but survived.
Most recently, in July, Sister Danielle Delafosse overcame her fear after  terrorists entered a small church at St.-Étienne-Du-Rouvray in Rouen, France, with the intent to kill people. She ran out of the church, found someone with a phone and had the person call the police, who arrived too late to save the Rev. Jacques Hamel, 85, who was killed, but perhaps in time to prevent more bloodshed.

While the heroism that gains attention is often the sort that risks the hero’s own life or limb, many who acted in less visible ways nonetheless transcended the moment. They responded with an extraordinary commitment to assist the wounded in circumstances that many would find overwhelming. In Nice, they include doctors, X-ray technicians, nurses and firefighters who worked hours upon hours treating the injured or trying to match lost children with their families.There was also Gilles Thévenet, the owner of the High Club, a popular discothèque in Nice that faces the Promenade des Anglais, who swiftly turned his nightclub into a triage center for emergency workers.Mr. Thévenet was sitting in his office in the back of the building, oblivious to the bloody chaos as the cargo truck careened by, until his security guards rushed in and he ran to the front door. “We heard the weeping, the cries, we saw the crowds,” he said.“I understood I had to choose. I could not open the door to the crowds of people and to those giving first aid, I decided the first priority was the wounded, to do as much as we could for the emergency responders who were trying to save whomever they could,” he said.In minutes, the firefighters and first-aid workers began carrying the injured — and the dead — into the club to get them off the promenade, which was thick with running, stumbling, screaming people. Soon, two medical helicopters landed just in front of the disco, where the aid workers performed triage, with the most badly hurt airlifted to hospitals nearby.Some of Mr. Thévenet’s security staff, who were trained in first aid, worked alongside the firefighters and emergency responders; a room in the club was set aside for the dead.Mr. Thévenet is not sure when — or even if — business will return, especially because many in Nice know that the dead and wounded lay in rows on the same floor where they would be dancing. But he believes it will.

“We will have to find again the party atmosphere, that has been our protein for 11 years,” he said. “It is out of the question to cede it to the terrorists.”
A few blocks farther west on the promenade, in sight of the sea, stands the ultramodern Lenval Foundation Hospital, one of only two major pediatric centers in southern France. and the place where Dr. Virginie Rampal, a pediatric orthopedist, who was born and raised in Nice, works day in and day out to mend the bones of children.She was on-call the night of the attack, but at home after a relatively quiet day. She had considered going with her daughters to the promenade to see the fireworks, but her plans changed when a friend stopped by. When Dr. Rampal’s pager went off, like everyone else, she did not know of the attack, but rushed to the emergency room.The wounded were already filling the chairs, lying on the floor, some with open fractures — most of them children. More were coming in, some carried in their parents’ arms.She helped with triage, went into surgery, back to triage, working without stopping as 30 young patients, many under the age of 10, were stabilized and sent into surgery. Of the 30 children, 28 survived — two died from head injuries and crushed pelvises, she said.At 7 a.m. she went home to shower. “I came in and took my daughter in my arms and held her close to me” — she has two girls, one 2½ and another 9 months old.She was back at the hospital 90 minutes later.

ISTANBUL — The wedding on Saturday night was winding down, and some guests had already left. But the music was still playing and people were still dancing in the narrow streets of Gaziantep, a city not far from the Syrian border.Just then a child — no more than 14 years old, Turkey’s president said later — meandered into the gathering and detonated a vest of explosives.Suddenly, the most joyous of occasions became a scene of blood and gore, with body parts scattered all around. Once again, the horrors of Syria’s civil war had visited Turkey.

Turkish President Blames ISIS for Attack


A resident of Gazientep, Turkey, describes the aftermath of a suicide bomb that killed at least 51 people at a Kurdish wedding party on Saturday. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blamed the Islamic State for the attack in the restive region that borders Syria.

The devastating bombing of the Kurdish wedding in Gaziantep killed more than 50 people, for which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blamed the Islamic State, the terrorist group that controls a swath of land straddling the frontier between Iraq and Syria.“In this area, we live in a ring of fire,” said Hilmi Karaca, a Kurdish activist who witnessed the explosion. “We live in a place where mothers are weeping for their dead children just hours after crying tears of joy at a wedding.”The attack was the deadliest in a string of terrorist bombings that have struck Turkey this year, as it grapples with the spiraling chaos of spillover from the war in Syria. Bombings this year that Turkish officials have blamed the Islamic State for have struck Istanbul’s old city, near the Blue Mosque; its most famous shopping boulevard, Istiklal Avenue; and, in June, Istanbul’s main airport, among the busiest in Europe.

                Wedding Bombing is the Latest in a Series of Deadly Terror Attacks in Turkey            

                The assault continues a string of deadly attacks.            



For years, critics have said that Turkey contributed to the chaos — allowing extremist rebels to cross its territory on their way to fight in Syria — to advance its goal of toppling the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. At the outset of the war in 2011, Mr. Erdogan was confident that Mr. Assad would quickly fall, as the dictators of Egypt and Tunisia had. But as the war ground on, Turkey increasingly found itself drawn in, with millions of refugees fleeing across the border and, over the last year, a spate of attacks within Turkey.At the same time, Kurdish militants in the southeast resumed a stalled war against the Turkish government, emboldened by the success of their brethren in Syria, where Kurds have carved out a region of autonomy in the country’s east.Now, Turkey finds itself with three enemies in the Syrian civil war — Mr. Assad, the Islamic State and Kurdish rebels — and escalating chaos within its own borders. The attack on Saturday in Gaziantep demonstrated how those conflicts sometimes overlap. The Islamic State, which has fought Kurds in Syria in cities like Kobani, have also targeted Kurds within Turkey, as they apparently did on Saturday by striking the wedding.

Turkey is also reeling from a failed military coup last month that aimed to topple the government of Mr. Erdogan and left at least 240 people dead. That conspiracy was blamed on followers of Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric in self-exile in Pennsylvania. Mr. Erdogan said on Saturday that there was no difference between the various terrorist organizations — the Islamic State, Kurdish militants or followers of Mr. Gulen — that are attacking the country.Hours before the attack on Saturday, the Turkish prime minister, Binali Yildirim, met with journalists over breakfast at an old Ottoman palace, once used by sultans for hunting excursions, that overlooks the Bosporus in Istanbul. He said Turkey would take a more active role in diplomatic efforts to end the war, working closely with world powers like Russia and Iran, two of Mr. Assad’s most ardent backers.Calling the Syrian conflict “the bleeding wound of the globe,” he said Turkey would accept a role for Mr. Assad during an interim period while the long-term future of the country was being resolved.



This was a slight shift in policy, as Turkey has long been adamant that Mr. Assad must go before any serious peace talks could take place. But it was unclear whether that matters this far into the conflict, and with Mr. Assad strengthened by Russian military support.“In the long term, can Syria bear Assad?” Mr. Yildirim said. “No way.”In normal times, Gaziantep is famous for its cuisine, especially baklava, the sweet pastry made with pistachios grown nearby. Before war broke out, busloads of Syrians crossed the border almost daily to shop in Gaziantep, as Mr. Erdogan pushed stronger economic ties with Syria.Yet in recent years the city became a hub for lives upended — and preoccupied — by the civil war in Syria. Spies, foreign fighters, diplomats, journalists, relief workers and refugees passed through the city, sometimes all gathering at the same Starbucks. In the earlier days of the conflict it was a place of intrigue, transformed much as the Pakistani border city of Peshawar was during the 1980s, when American-backed rebels moved through on their way to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan.

And then Gaziantep became more sinister and violent. The police found an Islamic State bomb-making facility in the city, which they said was used in an attack in Ankara last year that killed more than 100 people. The bomber who struck Istanbul’s Istiklal Avenue came from there, officials said. The Islamic State also carried out murders of Syrian journalists in the city.On Saturday, the city’s place as not just a remote transit hub for the war but a battleground itself came into focus again.“We had just walked past the wedding and offered our good wishes when we heard the blast,” said Ibrahim Ates, a local man. “Suddenly people started running past us. When we went back to see what had happened, everyone was on the floor, and there were body parts scattered everywhere and blood splattered on the walls.”

Mahmut Togrul, a lawmaker with the Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party who on Sunday visited the scene of the attack, said the wedding had been a traditional Kurdish ceremony and had taken place in a predominantly Kurdish neighborhood. He said that many of the victims — at least 51 people were killed and 69 more wounded, Mr. Erdogan said on Sunday — were children.That the perpetrator of the attack and so many of its victims were so young was a potent illustration of the degradation of the Syrian war as it has inflamed the region. Children have suffered immensely – one devastating image of a Syrian boy injured in an airstrike in Aleppo last week appeared on the front of newspapers around the world, a jarring reminder of the human cost of the war. The Islamic State, meanwhile, recruits boys as suicide bombers across Iraq and Syria.The bride and groom on Saturday, Besna and Nurettin Akdogan, survived without serious injuries. Neighbors said they were cousins who had been engaged for six months. After being released from the hospital, the bride said, “They turned our wedding into a blood bath,” according to the state-run Anadolu News Agency.





In Gaziantep on Sunday, a mass funeral was held at the Yesilkent cemetery. One of the mourners was Arif Yugmen, 35, who had left the wedding just before the attack.When he heard of the bombing, he said, he went back and took some of the wounded victims to the hospital in his car.Mr. Yugmen said the victims included so many children because they had gathered away from the folk dancing, in a place closer to the site of the blast.Nearby, Mizgin Gurbuzun, grieved over her dead 16-year-old son, falling to her knees beside his coffin.Rocking back and forth, and crying, she wailed, “My martyr son has gone.”

NAIROBI, Kenya — A suicide bomb rocked the Somali town of Galkayo on Sunday, killing at least 20 people and showing that Islamist militants, despite recent setbacks, can still plan and execute deadly attacks anywhere in the country.Galkayo, a midsize town in central Somalia, had been quiet in recent months.Yet that suddenly changed at 10 a.m. on Sunday when militants detonated a deafening bomb in a market, sending a column of black smoke shooting into the sky. A squad of militants stormed a nearby government building, engaging in gun battles with security forces.“One of the blasts was so huge, I was really shocked,” said Abdirahman Abdweli, a student in the city.The explosion ripped the roofs off several buildings, scattering sharp pieces of corrugated metal and debris across the area.The death toll was not immediately clear. The Shabab militant group, which claimed responsibility for the attack, said 30 people had been killed. Somali health officials and residents said the number was closer to 20, with dozens wounded.



The United States is increasingly watching Somalia, a poor, unstable country that has spewed violence across its borders for more than 20 years. On Aug. 10, American Special Forces assisted Somali troops in killing several members of the Shabab who were running an illegal checkpoint. Somali officials said the Shabab had lost “senior members” in that raid.In recent years, American airstrikes have killed many Shabab members, including both foot soldiers and top commanders.
On Monday, Secretary of State John Kerry is scheduled to hold talks on Somalia with African officials in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi. State Department officials said he would also focus on South Sudan, which has plunged into bloodshed and chaos as well.Somalia is scheduled to hold an election this year to choose its Parliament and president. But because of the rampant instability and the paucity of functioning government institutions, citizens will not be lining up to vote. Instead, clan elders will select delegates, who will then choose the politicians.Somali intellectuals have criticized this plan, saying the government is using the process as a way to stay in power and siphon more money from donor nations like the United States.“The prevailing Somali public view is that the electoral process will not be free, fair and transparent as vehemently claimed,” said Mohamud M. Uluso, a former Somali government official.

Jeffrey Gettleman reported from Nairobi, and Hussein Mohamed from Mogadishu, Somalia.

Kerry on U.N. Troops in South Sudan

NAIROBI, Kenya — A new protection force intended for South Sudan that was authorized by the United Nations this month needs to be deployed there as soon as possible to safeguard civilians, especially women and girls, Secretary of State John Kerry said on Monday.“We need to move forward,” Mr. Kerry said, calling South Sudan’s ethnically based conflict, which has killed tens of thousands in the past two and a half years, tragic and reprehensible.Mr. Kerry made the remarks while visiting Nairobi for the beginning of a six-day trip to Africa and the Middle East.Kenyan newspapers have described Mr. Kerry’s visit as a “peace mission” because the region’s conflicts are at the top of the agenda. Mr. Kerry is familiar with East Africa’s troubles, having flown in several times over the years to advocate peace proposals.As a senator, he visited Sudan, venturing to the war-plagued region of Darfur. He has also visited Juba, the capital of South Sudan, the world’s youngest country, where people on the street joked that he was a “white Dinka” because of his 6-foot-4-inch height. (The Dinka are among the biggest ethnic groups in South Sudan and are one of Africa’s tallest.)
So far, the government of South Sudan has resisted the planned deployment in Juba of a 4,000-soldier protection force, which the Security Council approved on Aug. 12 to bolster the United Nations peacekeeping mission there.That mission, which has about 12,000 soldiers, has been struggling to protect civilians from armed groups.International pressure for the additional force, which would be supplied by neighboring nations, escalated after a burst of fighting in July claimed hundreds of lives and resulted in rapes, including of Western aid workers.As Mr. Kerry emphasized several times on Monday: “This is not an intervention force, this is a protection force.”His words appeared aimed at the leaders of South Sudan’s warring factions who have often seemed to want to fight it out among themselves without a neutral force in between.President Salva Kiir of South Sudan, a Dinka, has resisted such a deployment, describing it as a United Nations takeover of the country. His main rival, the former vice president Riek Machar, a member of the Nuer ethnic group, fled the country last week, just a few months after he had returned under a peace deal that appears to have collapsed.Mr. Kerry met with the foreign ministers of five African countries — Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda — in an effort to coax them to play a bigger role in stabilizing trouble spots, such as South Sudan and Somalia.But he also said there was “a lot more going on in East Africa,” praising the region’s economic progress and “entrepreneurial energy.”
He shared some light comments about Kenya’s success at the Olympics in Brazil, where Kenyan runners won gold in the men and women’s marathons and other track and field events. He said he had congratulated President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya and had asked him “to teach us how to run.”On Tuesday, Mr. Kerry was scheduled to fly to Nigeria, where the topic of hundreds of missing schoolgirls, kidnapped in 2014 by the militant group Boko Haram, was bound to come up.Then he heads to Saudi Arabia to discuss the war in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia has been bombing areas of the country, trying to shore up a weak central government against Houthi insurgents. That action has provoked an outcry by international human rights groups who say the Saudi bombings have indiscriminately killed civilians.

The industry, which requires huge start-up costs, is dominated by a handful of established behemoths. Embraer of Brazil and Bombardier of Canada have long operated as a virtual duopoly in the midsize passenger jet market that Mitsubishi is targeting. Chinese and Russian manufacturers also recently tried to grab a share of the business, with mixed results.Taxpayer funds are on the line. The Japanese government is underwriting about a third of the development costs for the Mitsubishi jet, which were initially projected at $1.5 billion but are likely to rise after repeated delays.“It’s a miracle this project came about at all in this day and age,” said Yasuo Unakami, an analyst at the Japan Finance Corporation, a government-backed research and investment group. “If Japan succeeds at this, it could be a huge new industry. But the short-term hurdles are high.”For a country proud of its manufacturing heritage, the fact that no modern passenger airplane is marked “made in Japan” rankles.Japan was banned from making planes after its defeat in World War II. Although the prohibition ended decades ago, efforts to revive the industry stumbled. One project, a propeller plane called the YS-11, built by Mitsubishi and other big names in the 1960s and ’70s, was a commercial flop.

Even so, enthusiasts still celebrate the short-lived plane. When the last ones were retired from service by airlines a few years ago, newspapers and television news programs were full of nostalgic tributes.
The Mitsubishi Regional Jet, for which Kato is making parts, is drawing on a similar sentiment. At the unveiling of a prototype in 2014, a film showed workers holding signs with messages like “Made in Japan,” “This is our M.R.J.” and “M.R.J. renovates Japan.”“The world is full of products that are made in Japan, but unfortunately there hasn’t been a domestically made passenger plane in about 40 years,” Hideaki Omiya, the chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the plane’s developer, said at the time. “This is a long-held dream.”The Mitsubishi jet is the most prominent of several Japanese aircraft projects underway. Honda Aircraft Company, a subsidiary of Honda Motor, is developing a light jet for five or six passengers, but it is being built in North Carolina.Japanese military contractors are looking at overseas markets after a decades-long ban on arms exports was lifted in 2014. ShinMaywa Industries, for instance, is in talks to sell a large-capacity seaplane, the US-2, to the Indian Navy. In space launches, Mitsubishi is working on a new vehicle, the H3, that it says will halve the cost of putting a satellite in orbit.Mitsubishi considers its new passenger jet the logical extension of a business that has grown to encompass satellite-carrying rockets and large-scale subcontracting work on Boeing jets. The company says it has an edge in technology, in particular lightweight composite materials. The materials, Mitsubishi says, will make the new jet more fuel efficient than those of its rivals.But making parts and subsystems to order is one thing. Organizing the hugely complex task of assembling a modern jet is another.The delays to the project have added to costs and undercut technological advantages by giving competitors like Embraer time to catch up. Mitsubishi’s first test flight took place last year, three years behind schedule. The first delivery had originally been planned for early 2014, but is now expected in late 2018.Mitsubishi declined to disclose its latest cost estimates for the project, but it said it would cover any overruns without relying on additional support from public funds. “We will recover our investment costs in the long run,” it said in a statement.
Despite the challenges, Mitsubishi is a central piece of the government’s plans to nurture a broader industry and to provide a lift to the sagging economy. Aircraft manufacturing now generates about 1.5 trillion yen, or about $15 billion, in revenue for Japanese businesses, according to the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, an industry lobby. That is up by half from five years ago, though it is still just a small fraction of the auto industry’s sales.Japan’s efforts extend along the supply chain. C-Astac, a government organization, helps small-business owners break into aerospace, holding seminars to explain the certification and grant process.Subcontractors like Kato Manufacturing are benefiting from start-up cash and relaxed regulations on things like factory floor space to accommodate new machinery. Mr. Kato said he received a government grant of ¥15 million to buy new equipment.His new team is a mix of seasoned factory workers and novice recruits. Ryoji Soga, a young-looking 72, retired seven years ago but decided to come back when he heard the company needed experienced hands to produce new kinds of aircraft parts.Mr. Soga said he was glad to have a good-paying industrial job. “It’s better than waving a flag at a road construction site or cleaning toilets at a supermarket,” he said.

Killings Surge in Philippine Drug War


Under President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, 712 suspects have died in police operations and 1,067 have been killed by vigilantes, the nation’s police chief says.

MANILA — Killings by the police and vigilantes in the Philippines’ war on drugs have soared to nearly 1,800 in the seven weeks since President Rodrigo Duterte was sworn into office, the nation’s top police official told a Senate hearing on Monday.Under Mr. Duterte, who campaigned on a pledge to rid the country of drug dealers, 712 suspects have been killed in police operations, National Police Chief Ronald dela Rosa said. Vigilante killings have totaled 1,067 during the same period, he said, although it was unclear how many were directly related to the illegal drug trade.The numbers represent a huge increase over those cited by the police last week, when they put the total at more than 800 since Mr. Duterte’s election on May 9. The new figures do not include killings that occurred between the election and his inauguration on June 30.The police did not explain the sudden increase. Senators are expected to question them about the tally on Tuesday during a second day of joint hearings by the chamber’s committee on justice and human rights and the committee on public order and dangerous drugs.Mr. Duterte is said to have incited the wave of killings with his vow to eradicate crime. He has said the police should “shoot to kill” when they encounter members of organized crime or suspects who violently resist arrest.
Human rights advocates have been horrified by the killings, but Mr. Duterte’s popularity has soared among a large segment of Filipinos weary of crime and enthusiastic about his pledge to rid the country of drug dealers.Senator Leila de Lima, a longtime Duterte opponent who led the hearing on Monday, called on the government to end the killings.

“I strongly believe extrajudicial or extralegal killings, whether perpetrated by the state or by nonstate actors, must stop,” she said. “Blatant disregard for human life has to stop.”Richard Javad Heydarian, who teaches political science at De La Salle University in Manila, said many members of the public were giving Mr. Duterte wide leeway to deliver on his promise to suppress the drug scourge within three to six months. Mr. Duterte’s “shock and awe” approach reflects not only his commitment to eradicating drugs, Mr. Heydarian said, but also extremely high public expectations.“The more fundamental question at this point is, why the seemingly unprecedented support for the new president despite global criticism of his uncompromising approach?” he said. “I think it largely has to do with dissipated public trust in existing judicial institutions, a sense that the normal democratic processes are not coping with the magnitude of the crisis.”In recent days, the president has lashed out at critics. On Sunday, he threatened to withdraw from the United Nations after two human rights experts from the world body urged the country to stop the killings. Mr. Duterte’s foreign minister later said the Philippines would not take that step.Last week, Mr. Duterte sharply criticized Ms. de Lima, calling her immoral and accusing her of receiving money from drug dealers, a charge she emphatically denies.On Monday, the senators heard from two women whose family members had been killed by the police.Mary Rose Aquino, who testified wearing a bandanna, sunglasses and a hooded sweatshirt so she could not be recognized, said her parents were found dead on June 20. Her father had been an informant for corrupt police officers who would raid dealers and take the drugs for themselves, she said. Sometimes the officers would smoke methamphetamine at their home, she said.
“I know who they are,” she told the senators. “I can recognize their faces, others by their names. My father was a police asset who informed police what houses to raid. They would then resell the drug.”She said her parents had planned to get out of the drug trade, and she blamed the police for their deaths. She and her siblings have been hiding from the police since their parents died, she said, sobbing.

The senators also heard from Harra Kazuo, whose husband, Jaypee Bertes, and his father, Renato Bertes, were killed by the officers inside the Pasay City police station after they were arrested.She told the committee that the police had been extorting money from her husband, a small-time drug peddler. She said he had been preparing to surrender to the police because he was afraid he would be killed. About 600,000 people suspected of being drug dealers or users have turned themselves in to escape being killed since the antidrug campaign began, the authorities have said.Wearing large sunglasses and partly covering her face with a shawl, Ms. Kazuo told the senators that the police had beaten her husband and threatened to shoot him if he did not hand over his drugs, but that he had nothing to give them. The police strip-searched their 2-year-old daughter looking for drugs, she said. Renato Bertes arrived in the middle of the commotion, and the police beat him for insisting they show him a warrant, she said.“If you want, we can shoot you all here,” Ms. Kazuo said one officer told them.At the station, the police severely beat the two men, breaking her husband’s arm, according to a forensic report. The police said the two had tried to grab their guns and escape. Each man was shot three times.Ms. Kazuo, who is seven months pregnant, said she had visited them at the station before their deaths and had seen that her husband was in poor condition. He asked for a doctor.“He was leaning on the bars and had a hard time standing,” she said. “He had a difficult time speaking. That was the last time I saw them alive.”
After the hearing, Chief dela Rosa said he was surprised by the women’s testimony, which he said contradicted official reports. The Bertes case was rare, he said, because the two were killed inside a jail cell.He said he would investigate Ms. Aquino’s account of police behavior.“I will not tolerate this,” Chief dela Rosa said. “I myself will find these policemen.” But he said the campaign against drugs would not stop, because the police had orders from the president to eliminate drugs.“The police now have the momentum,” he said.

BERLIN — Germany, France and Italy will be the three most important nations left in the European Union after Britain’s stunning decision in June to leave the bloc. Yet all are substantially weakened by nagging domestic problems at a critical moment when Europe needs a new direction.So the summer weather did little to disguise the gloom that hung over a small summit meeting on Monday held by the leaders of the three nations off the coast of Naples, Italy, where they began charting a new course for the 27 countries that will be left in the bloc.The three leaders used the moment to present a united front, emphasizing that the benefits of the union far outweighed the challenges it faced and making clear that Europe would persevere, even after the British vote.“We respect the choice of British citizens, but we want to write a new page for the future,” Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy said. The aftermath of the “Brexit” vote, as it is commonly known, called for “strong measures to boost growth and fight youth unemployment,” he said, as well as for investments and structural reforms.The way forward, however, was far from clear. Though Mr. Renzi played the host, the role of guiding the bloc rests largely on the shoulders of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the leader of Europe’s strongest economy.
Ms. Merkel, like Mr. Renzi and President François Hollande of France, faces immediate challenges that make decisive action even more difficult than it has been for the last several years in the face of Europe’s economic, migration and border crises.For Ms. Merkel, those challenges include terrorist assaults at home last month that have helped fuel support for a far-right party in elections in her political home state and added to her vulnerability over her refugee policy. That is in addition to a failed coup in Turkey and worsening conflict in Ukraine and Syria.Mr. Hollande is entering spring presidential elections with record-low approval ratings, a sluggish economy and his nation in a skittish mood after a series of terrorist attacks. He is facing potential challenges even from within his own party, in addition to those from conservatives and the far right under Marine Le Pen. 



                What’s Next for Business After ‘Brexit’?            

                More than a month on, little is clear. Britain’s trading relationship with the E.U. looks to be in limbo. Companies are reassessing their long-term investments in Britain. Here’s what’s happened so far.            



On Monday, former President Nicolas Sarkozy formally announced that he would run to again be the standard-bearer for the center-right Republicans party, though when he left office four years ago, he too was deeply unpopular.Italy recorded zero growth in the second quarter this year. Mr. Renzi has staked his political future on a November referendum on constitutional changes. Defeat could mean early elections.“Although in different ways, all three are weak leaders facing internal difficulties, with more or less imminent electoral tests, and therefore with narrow margins to maneuver,” wrote Adriana Cerretelli in an editorial on Sunday in the Italian daily Il Sole 24 Ore. She nonetheless called for “imagination, political courage and strategic vision to lift Europe out of the ford in which it has been mired for years.”Yet the three leaders themselves remain divided on critical issues, not least whether to allow flexibility on stiff budget requirements for the 19 eurozone countries that Ms. Merkel insists are necessary and that Mr. Renzi, especially, blames for stunting economic growth.Allowing some leeway might bolster Mr. Hollande and Mr. Renzi politically, but it would be further proof of the European Union’s inability to stick to its own rules.
Jan Techau, a German analyst who is the chairman of Carnegie Europe in Brussels, cast doubt on whether any progress could be made on the issue.“He wants a revised eurozone, moving away from austerity,” Mr. Techau said, referring to Mr. Renzi. “Everyone knows that the eurozone must be reformed. But the timing and direction are completely open, and completely disputed.”Ms. Merkel faces national elections in the fall of 2017, and it is unlikely that a euro overhaul will be achieved before then, Mr. Techau noted. “She doesn’t want to get rushed into anything before elections next year.”As a leading German newspaper, Süddeutsche Zeitung, put it, “Over the next month, Europe will embark on a quest for meaning.”

                Britain’s financial and military connections to the rest of Europe.            



The talks on Monday are supposed to culminate in mid-September in a meeting of the 27 nations that will remain in the bloc. The three top leaders have promised new efforts on internal and external security; fresh stimulus for growth and jobs; and special programs for Europe’s youth, who are bearing the brunt of unemployment almost everywhere but Germany.There is no clear indication of how or why these efforts would succeed where others have failed. Yet the pressure is immense; if Europe cannot rally to its many challenges, anti-European Union feelings could lead to even more referendums.The Netherlands, which already voted against a Europe-wide agreement on Ukraine in a referendum this summer, “are a very nervous European partner at the moment,” Mr. Techau said.Other factors gnawing at Europe’s fragile unity include the rerun presidential election scheduled for Oct. 2 in Austria, where a far-right politician could win in the first such triumph in Europe since 1945.
Ms. Merkel will spend the rest of the week crisscrossing central and Eastern Europe and then hosting Western European conservative leaders at a castle outside Berlin to try to forge new unity. Mr. Hollande and Mr. Renzi are likely to reach out to politicians in Portugal, Spain and Greece to unite the Continent’s southern flank.One important task is working out a mandate for Michel Barnier, a veteran politician from France, to negotiate with the British on behalf of the European Union.No one knows when negotiations on Britain’s departure will begin. Prime Minister Theresa May has hinted that London might not activate the relevant clause — known as Article 50 — until late this year, or even early in 2017. The complex separation will then have to be negotiated within two years.In Ms. Merkel’s view, that ball is very much in Britain’s court. In contrast to the many meetings planned with European leaders this week, the only place she will run into a leading Briton is at a celebration in Germany’s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, where Britain will be represented by Prince William, who, like other members of the royal family, has no say in politics.“We are not conducting any prenegotiations with the British, Ms. Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said on Monday. “It is up to them to tell us” when the clock starts ticking on Britain’s membership, he said, which for now remains, “with all the advantages — and all the obligations.”

MOSCOW — A week after allowing Russian planes to fly bombing runs into Syria from a base inside its borders, Iran reversed course on Monday and withdrew permission for the flights, complaining that the Kremlin had been too public about the arrangement.The about-face and the explanation for it from Iran’s Foreign Ministry seemed to surprise Russia, where state news media had been trumpeting the deal as a sign of a growing friendship with Iran. No foreign power has based forces in Iran since World War II.In response, the Russian military issued a statement saying its planes had already completed their missions.“The Russian military aircraft involved in launching airstrikes from the Iranian Hamadan base against terrorist sites in Syria successfully accomplished the tasks they had set out to complete,” Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said in a statement. “All aircraft involved in this operation are now on Russian territory.”The agreement had seemingly marked a milestone for Russian foreign policy in the Middle East and a strengthening alliance with the region’s Shiite powers of Iran, Iraq and the government side in Syria’s civil war.

Iran Denies Russia Has a Local Base


A spokesman for Iran's foreign ministry said that Russia does not have a base in Iran, and that airstrikes launched by Russia from Iran against militants in Syria was a temporary arrangement.

                    By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS on                                                                Publish Date August 22, 2016.

The reasons for the abrupt unraveling of the agreement were unclear, even to Russian analysts of the region. Iran’s minister of defense, Brig. Gen. Hossein Dehghan, accused Russia of publicizing the deal excessively, calling the Kremlin’s behavior a “betrayal of trust.”With a history of meddling by Western powers, notably Britain, Iran guards its sovereignty closely. After Russia’s Tupolov and Sukhoi bombers started flying last week, Iranian members of Parliament said the agreement might be in violation of the Constitution.
“We have not given any military base to the Russians and they are not here to stay,” General Dehghan said. The two countries had “no written agreement” for use of the base, he said, adding that it was only a temporary agreement on refueling.Russia announced what it described as a deal to use the Iranian base on Aug. 16, saying it would shorten the distance flown by long-range bombers, which had been flying from southern Russia.A Russian analyst of the Middle East, Yuri Barmin, posted on Twitter that it was clear the base was “a temporary arrangement due to logistical difficulties” but added that the termination “was too quick.”Victor Mizin, a professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Russia’s university for diplomats, said the symbolism of the air base deal had been important in Moscow.“The message was a continuation of what Russia started in Syria,” Mr. Mizin said, “which is saying that Russia has returned to the status of a great power, like the Soviet Union, only without the ideology.” Continue reading the main story



LONDON — Convicts in British prisons who preach terrorism and extreme ideology to fellow inmates will be held in high-security “specialist units,” the government announced on Monday, amid efforts to crack down on Islamic radicalization in jails.The announcement reflects an emerging trend in Europe to isolate terrorism convicts and influential extremists from the rest of the prison population. Prisons are often regarded as potential breeding grounds for would-be terrorists, particularly for young offenders serving sentences for crimes unrelated to terrorism but who nonetheless fall under the spell of older, charismatic inmates.Last week, Anjem Choudary, one of Britain’s best-known Islamist activists, was found guilty of inviting support for the Islamic State. He could face a lengthy prison term.“There are a small number of individuals, very subversive individuals, who do need to be held in separate units,” Elizabeth Truss, who took office last month as justice secretary and who made the announcement, told the BBC. Under the plan, prison wardens, or governors, will also be instructed to remove extremist literature and tighten the vetting of prison chaplains.The announcement was in response to a government review of Islamist extremism in prisons, a summary of which was also published on Monday.
The review, led by a former prison governor, Ian Acheson, recommended placing in specialist units a “small subset of extremists who present a particular and enduring risk to national security through subversive behavior, beliefs and activities.”Antiterrorism legislation passed after the July 7, 2005, bombings in London, which killed 56 people, including four bombers, criminalized “those who glorify terrorism, those involved in acts preparatory to terrorism and those who advocated it without being directly involved,” the review noted.

The review identified the ways that Islamist extremism could manifest itself in prison, including gang culture, terrorism convicts who advocate support for the Islamic State, and charismatic prisoners “acting as self-styled ‘emirs.’ ”“Aggressive encouragement of conversions to Islam, unsupervised collective worship, attempts to prevent staff searches by claiming dress is religious, intimidation of prison imams, and exploitation of staff for fear of being labeled racist” are also indicators, according to the review.It concluded that “cultural sensitivity” by prison staff members toward Muslim inmates inhibited the jailers’ ability to challenge extremist views and behavior.In the late 1990s, Britain used a “policy of dispersal” aimed at convicted members of the Irish Republican Army, according to the government. But they were relatively few in number and had little influence on other prisoners. Since then, that policy has not been changed in response to the threat from Islamist extremism, the government said.The authors of the review said they had visited prisons in the Netherlands, France and Spain, which also isolate extremists from the mainstream prison population and keep them in high-security conditions.This year, the French authorities introduced a program in at least five prisons that placed selected extremists and terrorism convicts in separate blocks, usually involving groups of 20.Peter Dawson, the director of the Prison Reform Trust, an organization based in London, said prisoners should not be permanently kept in small, isolated units. “The goal must be to get people back into the main prison community, so that changes in their behavior can be observed,” he said. “Anything else is just storing up an even more difficult problem for when they are eventually released.”
Muslim prison chaplains also need the government’s full support, Mr. Dawson said. “They are part of the solution, not the problem.”

Already reeling from corruption scandals and a declining security situation, President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico was accused on Sunday of plagiarizing nearly a third of his law school thesis, according to a report by an investigative journalist.The journalist, Carmen Aristegui, has reported on several articles that have contributed to the president’s declining public approval ratings, including the disclosure in 2014 of his wife’s questionable real estate dealings with major government contractors.

Ms. Aristegui lost her job in 2015 after her reporting on the Mexico City mansion built for the president’s wife, Angélica Rivera, by a firm that had received hundreds of millions of dollars in government contracts. Since then, Ms. Aristegui has been publishing her work on her own website.Her latest article, published on the website aristeguinoticias.com, cited a report by a group of specialists and academics who reviewed Mr. Peña Nieto’s roughly 200-page thesis on the Mexican presidency, which he submitted in 1991 and wrote while studying for his degree at the Panamerican University from 1984 to 1989.The report says that the young Mr. Peña Nieto appropriated the work of at least 10 authors without attribution, including parts that were apparently taken from the work of a former president of Mexico.Mr. Peña Nieto’s spokesman, Eduardo Sanchez, issued a brief statement on Monday characterizing any similarities between the president’s thesis and earlier work as “style errors,” such as forgetting to quote passages correctly or cite original authors mentioned in the bibliography.

BEIJING — She was a face that people passed on the sidewalk without noticing, a sickly young woman with red lipstick and a pile of clothes. She hawked skirts for $15 and scarves for $10, joking with passers-by about the tedium of life.But to those who stopped to listen, the woman, Liu Lingli, offered an extraordinary tale. She had once been a university teacher of English in Lanzhou, a city in northwest China, but she was fired for absenteeism after being treated for ovarian cancer. She decided to sue the school for wrongful termination, and in the meantime, to sell clothes on the street to pay her medical bills.For much of the last two years, Ms. Liu grappled with her medical and legal battles in private. But on Monday, her story exploded into the public sphere, after Lanzhou Jiaotong University said it was “deeply sorry” and agreed to pay the wages it had denied her.There was only one problem: After months of legal wrangling, Ms. Liu, 32,  died on Aug. 14 from complications of cancer.For many Chinese, the case was a poignant reminder of the shortcomings of the nation’s legal system and the persistent stigma of illness and disability.
On Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter, commenters attacked the university and expressed concern about what they described as a callous attitude toward employees with illnesses in China.“The death of humanity,” a user named WangFuping8583 wrote.Others said the case revealed a lack of respect for workers’ rights and called for the firing of the university’s president.“The lack of humanity at institutions of higher learning is sending chills through all of society,” LiYinan_704 wrote.Ms. Liu became ill in the summer of 2014, after two years of teaching English at Lanzhou Jiaotong University’s Bowen College, according to interviews with her friends and news media reports. She took sick leave that fall, but in early 2015, when her mother requested more time for Ms. Liu to recover and asked the school to continue paying her medical insurance, the university fired her, citing her poor attendance record.Chinese law prohibits employers from firing workers while they are receiving medical treatment. But the law is often ignored, legal experts said, especially in industries like mining and construction, where workers often fall ill or are injured on the job.Lu Jiefeng, a law professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing who has studied employment discrimination, said the university’s handling of the case was a clear violation of labor law.“Not only did the school fail to show much concern,” Mr. Lu said, “it kind of stabbed her in the back at a time when she needed the most help.”Officials at Lanzhou Jiaotong University did not respond to requests for comment.Shortly after she was let go, Ms. Liu filed a lawsuit against the university, arguing that she had been wrongfully dismissed.
The court sided with Ms. Liu, ordering Lanzhou Jiaotong to restore her employment, but the school did not comply, choosing instead to appeal the decision. In June, the school lost the appeal.Ms. Liu’s medical bills for chemotherapy and other treatments quickly piled up, totaling more than $60,000, far out of reach for her mother and father, who earned only about $500 per month, according to news reports. Her father also has cancer.Even as her health deteriorated, Ms. Liu was determined to pay her bills and decided to begin selling clothes. Outside a shopping mall in Lanzhou last autumn, she met Nie Ting, 29, an employee at a tour agency, and the two became friends.Ms. Nie, 29, said in a telephone interview on Monday that she was struck by Ms. Liu’s willpower: She continued selling clothes even after she began using a wheelchair.“She was a strong woman,” Ms. Nie said. “I had no idea she had cancer the first time I met her.”Ms. Liu did not speak often about her dismissal, but when she did, she told friends that she felt humiliated.“I used to be a teacher who stood at the podium,” Ms. Liu once said, according to Ms. Nie, “and now I’ve ended up selling clothes on the street.”On Monday, the Chinese news site  The Paper reported that Lanzhou Jiaotong University said it would pay Ms. Liu’s family nearly $11,000, including about $2,200 to cover the cost of her funeral. It also suspended the human resources director at the college where Ms. Liu was working, The Paper reported.
Her mother, Liu Shuqin, declined to comment when reached by telephone on Monday, saying only, “I haven’t slept for days.”

In the final months of Ms. Liu’s life, the financial burden of her disease seemed to become overwhelming, and her optimism faded.In her last post on WeChat, she wrote, “With business as it is, I might as well die.”

PARIS — What is it about the head scarf? Or the “burkini,” the head-to-ankle bathing suit that serves as a demure covering for female Muslims now lighting up the political sphere in France?The moves by French mayors in coastal cities to ban the burkini on their beaches has put a new twist on a long-running debate in Europe and beyond about whether Muslim women should or shouldn’t cover their heads and, in rarer cases, their bodies.In the mid-1990s, when the cornerstone of Turkish society was an aggressively secularist ideology, a ban on wearing head scarves in hospitals, courts, government offices and universities was a red flag for the Islamist Welfare Party, which campaigned vigorously to overturn it.The ban inflamed passions across the country to the point that in July 1995, an Islamic extremist shot to death a provincial bar association official who had threatened to remove two female lawyers from the courtroom for covering their heads. The killer said he had meant to set an “example for those who would ban” the head scarf.Attitudes toward the role of Islam in everyday life have since shifted in Turkey, as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Islamist party, Justice and Development, the heir to the Welfare Party, has moved to ease the head scarf ban — first in government offices and universities and then, in 2014, in middle and high schools.
In Turkey, traditional Muslim women have long argued that wearing what they want on their heads is a fundamental human right. Feminists and secularists counter that the head scarf is a symbol of women’s subjection to men, and of Mr. Erdogan’s project to restore the country’s Islamic identity.These same arguments are heard elsewhere. In Morocco, private pools and beaches have banned the burkini for several years, mostly in the name of hygiene. According to the magazine Jeune Afrique, women in burkinis — typically a knee-length hooded tunic covering a body suit — have been publicly criticized for celebrating their freedom by completely hiding their bodies. 


            Are You a Muslim Woman? Share Your Thoughts on Veil Restrictions        


In France, it began with a 2004 law banning “ostentatious” religious symbols in classrooms, which was aimed at the head scarf but also included the Jewish skullcap and large Christian crosses.That was followed by another law, adopted in 2010, which banned full-face veils, most notably burqas, in the name of public security.What is allowed are full-length head coverings that leave faces and hands exposed. These were much in evidence recently on the Rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud, a street in central Paris that is a center of Islamic bookshops, halal butchers and boutiques specializing in “Oriental fashion,” also known as “modest fashion.”In a shop where multicolored Turkish-made burkinis selling for 69 euros, about $78, have found few buyers lately, two young saleswomen clad in black hijabs decried the ban as absurd and insulting.Until these bathing costumes began to appear on the market, in 2004, the two women said, they mostly avoided the beach except to dabble their toes in the water. Now, one said, she is able to go Jet-Skiing.The burkinis, the two young women said, have given a new generation of observant Muslim women a chance to enjoy a day by the sea, unlike their mothers, who were confined to their kitchens. Women wearing burkinis, they said, should be welcomed for their willingness to open up to the outside world, rather than be fined and sent home.
On another side of Paris, a middle-aged woman wearing a scarf on her head, a long skirt and long-sleeved sweater said she, too, almost never goes to the beach. When she does, she allows herself to wear a short-sleeved T-shirt.Marie-Joseph, who refused to give her last name, has chosen a dress code that corresponds to her status as a “consecrated virgin,” a woman who has dedicated her life to God.In her view, what she wears is her business — and no one else’s, a right she thinks should be enjoyed by all women everywhere.

A stunt in Prague on Sunday stirred panic among tourists who thought a terrorist attack was underway.

Sporting detachable beards, the men drove a Hummer onto Old Town Square in Prague on Sunday, wielding fake submachine-style BB guns and waving an Islamic State flag. Accompanied by a camel and a goat, they shouted “Allahu akbar” and fired guns without pellets.“We are bringing you the light of true faith,” the leader of the men, Martin Konvicka, who was dressed as an imam, told the crowd.Mr. Konvicka is an anti-immigration activist, and his stunt — which had been preapproved by City Hall — was intended to sound the alarm about what he views as the threat posed by Islam to the Czech way of life. But he evidently did not anticipate how it would be received.Prague is one of Central Europe’s most visited destinations; tourists throng the medieval Old Town and neighboring Josefov, the historic Jewish quarter, and nearby landmarks like the Charles Bridge and Prague Castle.The faux occupation stirred panic among tourists, including a group of visitors from Israel. Dozens of onlookers, including some with children, ran for cover, knocking over chairs at restaurants. Several tourists suffered bruises.
“I was entering Old Town Square from a far corner and heard gunshots,” said Andrea Steinova, a Prague resident. “Then I saw a group of about 40 people, some of them yelling in Hebrew, running toward me. A couple of them tripped and fell, and others ran over them.”Kristyna Vinsova, a server at Kotleta, a restaurant on the square, said about 80 people charged through the doors. “They knocked over tables and chairs, they were absolutely terrified and there were many families with children,” she said. “After about 15 minutes, one man went to see what was going on and came back to tell us it was a ‘theatrical performance.’ But it took many of the people around an hour to actually calm down and leave.”Aaron Gunsberger, who owns a kosher restaurant in the Jewish quarter, grabbed his gun and ran to the square, fearful that an attack was taking place.“When I figured out what was happening, I told some puzzled American tourists that this was just our local clown, but that I didn’t think it was funny,” he said. “If they had shown up like this in front of my restaurant, I’d be in jail now because I would have shot them.”Gun laws in the Czech Republic are generally less restrictive than in most other parts of Europe, and Josefov — whose synagogues and cemetery survived World War II because the Nazi occupiers intended for the quarter to become a museum of the extinct Jewish race — is, like many Jewish neighborhoods in Europe, carefully guarded.The act over the weekend was halted before it got to its planned end: The simulated killing of a prisoner, dressed in an orange jumpsuit, in the square.The Czech interior minister, Milan Chovanec, was not amused.  On Twitter, he called the protest a sign of “idiocy.”Not all tourists were sent into panic.Footage showed some onlookers taking photographs or videos, and even giggling. Other people taunted the protesters; one woman shouted at the men, “Xenophobe! Xenophobe!”
Mr. Konvicka, an entomologist at University of South Bohemia in Ceske Budejovice, in the country’s south, founded a group called “We don’t want Islam in the Czech Republic.” He had called the protest “The Occupation of Prague” and scheduled it for Sunday, the 48th anniversary the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.On his Facebook page, he called the operation a success. “Until a few Muslims started shouting aggressively and pushing toward the performers, everything was going very peacefully,” he wrote.In a telephone interview, Mr. Konvicka said it was obvious that the mock attack was a stunt, adding, “The police checked our air guns and even counted how many bearded guys were in our group, to make sure we didn’t deviate from what we told City Hall we would do.”A spokesman for the Prague police, Tomas Hulan, said the department had no power to ban the event as it had been approved by City Hall. He said officers had questioned eight people and were looking into whether anyone could be charged for disturbing the peace.City Hall officials defended their decision to allow the protest but acknowledged that they had not fully understood what would unfold. “We only had very basic information of what the spectacle would be like,” said Vit Hofman, a spokesman for City Hall. “Had we known what was going to transpire, we would certainly have banned it.”The Czech Republic, like other countries in Europe, has been grappling with fears about Islamic terrorism that are being exploited across the political spectrum.This month, a 25-year-old mechanic and loner from a small Czech town, who tried to travel to Syria in January, was charged with attempted terrorism, in what the authorities said was the first known case of a Czech citizen’s trying to join the Islamic State.The case stirred anxieties that homegrown Islamic radicalism may have migrated to Eastern and Central Europe. In the Czech Republic, such concerns have been fanned by President Milos Zeman, who warned last year that Islamic State jihadists must be crushed to prevent a “super Holocaust,” and who suggested that Czechs might want to arm themselves.The country has about 10.5 million people, with roughly 20,000 Muslims.

ANKARA, Turkey —  Turkey vowed Monday to fight Islamic State militants at home and to "cleanse" the group from its borders after a weekend suicide bombing at a Kurdish wedding, an attack that came amid recent gains by Syrian Kurdish militia forces against the extremists in neighboring Syria.The bombing Saturday in the southern city of Gaziantep, near the border with Syria, killed at least 54 people — many of them children. Nearly 70 others were wounded in the attack, the deadliest in Turkey this year.There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but officials said it appeared to be the work of the Islamic State group. Authorities were trying to identify the attacker, who President Recep Tayyip Erdogan initially said was a child. However, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said Monday that it was unclear whether the bomber was "a child or a grown-up.""A clue has not yet been found concerning the perpetrator," Yildirim told reporters following a weekly Cabinet meeting. He said the earlier assertion that the attacker was child was a "guess" based on witness accounts.At least 22 of those killed were children younger than 14, according to a Turkish official who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with Turkish government rules.
The attack came after the Syria Democratic Forces, a coalition led by the main Kurdish militia groups in Syria, captured the former IS stronghold of Manbij in northern Syria under the cover of airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition."It appears to be an act to punish the PYD," said Nihat Ali Ozcan a security and terrorism expert at the Ankara-based Economic Policy Research Foundation of Turkey, referring to a Syrian Kurdish group whose militia is fighting IS. "It's the cross-border settlement of scores by two actors fighting in Syria."Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters Monday that Turkey would press ahead with its fight against the Islamic State group inside Turkey and support efforts to remove IS fighters from its borders."Our border has to be completely cleansed of Daesh," Cavusoglu said, using an Arabic acronym for the extremists. IS "martyred our ... citizens. It is natural for us to struggle against such an organization both inside and outside of Turkey."Cavusoglu said Turkey had become a main IS target because of measures it has implemented to stop recruits from crossing into Syria to join the fighting, as well as hundreds of arrests of IS suspects in Turkey."Turkey has always been Daesh's primary target, because Turkey has dried out the source of Daesh's supply of foreign fighters. ... It has stopped them from crossing into Syria," he said.The deadly attack also came amid ongoing struggles between the government and Kurdish militants linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the PKK, and as the country was still reeling from the aftermath of last month's failed coup attempt, which the government has blamed on a U.S.-based Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen, and his followers.The bombing follows a suspected IS attack in June on Istanbul's main airport that killed 44 people; a double suicide bombing blamed on IS at a peace rally in Turkey's capital, Ankara, in October killed 103 people.
Ozcan, the security expert, said Saturday's attack was likely carried out by a local IS cell whose members would have known the wedding was a Kurdish one and targeted the wedding party for the "shock" value.The bride and groom, who survived the bombing, urged authorities to act to prevent future bloodshed."They turned our best day to hell. We have no relatives left. They all died," said the groom, Nurettin Akdogan. "I hope this will be the last one. Let no one else get hurt.""From now on, find a solution," added the bride, Besna Akdogan, sobbing.One of the wedding guests, Nursel Saglam, was on a rooftop overlooking the outdoor celebrations when the bomb went off. When she looked down after the explosion, everyone below was hurt or dead, she said."I can't forget that moment," she said, adding that she hasn't been able to return to her house near the scene of the attack and was staying with her sister.Halil Ilter said he was at home when he heard the blast and rushed to the scene to check on his relatives."I cannot recount what I saw," said Ilter, who lost five young cousins. "I am not myself since. There is nothing to say. It was murder.""My uncle's children died. They were aged 13, 14. One was only 5," he said. Continue reading the main story



According to Mr. Leung’s organization, the International WingTsun Association, former apprentices have opened 4,000 branches in more than 65 countries, but only five in Hong Kong.Few kung fu schools remain in Yau Ma Tei, a district of Kowloon that was once the center for martial arts. Nathan Road — where the young Bruce Lee learned his craft from Ip Man (often spelled Yip Man), the legendary teacher who was the subject of Wong Kar-wai’s 2013 film “The Grandmaster” — is now lined with cosmetic shops and pharmacies that cater to tourists from the mainland.Though he lives in Yau Ma Tei, Tony Choi, a recent college graduate, has never been tempted to check out the remaining schools. Mr. Choi, 22, said that “kung fu just never came to mind.”He added, “Kung fu is more for retired uncles and grandpas.”When they do train in martial arts, younger people here tend to pick Thai boxing and judo.Valerie Ng, a 20-year-old college student, says she prefers Thai boxing because it is “attractive and charming” and does not take as long to master. She noted that kung fu masters often do not have defined muscles and that some of them look, well, a little chubby.

“You can see how fierce Thai boxing is from watching professional matches,” she said. “But I rarely see such competition for kung fu, which makes me wonder whether those kung fu masters really are good at fighting or they just claim to be,” she said.
So Tak Chung, 59, remembers how different things were. When he was a boy, he and his friends would run home from school as fast as they could to watch kung fu shows on television.“Kung fu always gave me a sense of justice and pride in being Chinese,” Mr. So said while stretching his legs for a Sunday night lesson at Kowloon Park. “It feels like if you knew kung fu, you could beat the bad guys and help the needy.”Mr. So’s master, Mak Che Kong, 64, is less hopeful about the future. He ran one of the last studios in Kowloon, but soaring rents caused it to shut down, along with other family businesses that were once a fixture of Hong Kong street life, like Dit Da, or bone-setting, shops that use traditional Chinese medicine to treat sprains and fractures.Mr. Mak, who is not related to the author of the martial arts history, has fewer than 20 students now, down from twice that number several years ago. Most students are over the age of 40.He holds classes all over the city because “students will not come if they need to travel much.” On Tuesdays, he teaches at a pier in the city’s Central District; on Wednesdays, near a government marriage registry in Sha Tin in the New Territories; and on Sundays, at a public park in Kowloon.





Describing himself as “old school,” Mr. Mak fiercely defended kung fu traditions. “Chinese kung fu is not about fighting; it is about patience and hard work,” he said.When he learned kung fu in the late 1960s, masters were father figures and apprentices had deep respect for kung fu. Students were willing to spend months or years perfecting just their horse-riding stance, a rest position often used for practicing punches and strengthening the legs and back.“Today, if you ask a student to practice horse-riding stance for one lesson, he will not come again,” Mr. Mak said. “They are used to living a comfortable life.”
In English, kung fu is often used as an umbrella term for all Chinese martial arts. But in Chinese, it refers to any discipline or skill that is achieved through hard work.Kung fu traces its history to ancient China, with hundreds of fighting styles developing over the centuries. But it soared in popularity at the beginning of the 20th century, as revolution swept the nation.After the fall of the Qing dynasty a century ago, the Chinese Nationalist party, or the Kuomintang, used martial arts to promote national pride, setting up competitions and sending an exhibition team to the Olympics. But the government also tried to suppress wuxia, a martial arts genre of literature and film, as superstitious and potentially subversive.

When the Nationalists fell in 1949, the new Communist government in Beijing sought to control martial arts from the Chinese mainland. The Shaolin Temple, said to be the home of Asian martial arts in central China, was ransacked during the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76 and its Buddhist monks jailed.Throughout those decades, martial artists from mainland China sought refuge in what was then the British colony of Hong Kong.By the 1970s, kung fu fever had spread around the world. In addition to Bruce Lee’s films, the television series “Kung Fu,” starring David Carradine, became one of the most popular programs in the United States.Though Hong Kong’s kung fu films do not draw the attention they once did, the genre has influenced a generation of directors, including Quentin Tarantino and Ang Lee, and the actor Jackie Chan and others have kept it alive as comedy.In a twist, kung fu has enjoyed a renaissance in mainland China, where the government has standardized it and promoted it in secondary schools as a sport known as wushu to foster national pride.
As the martial arts center of gravity shifts to the mainland, some in Hong Kong have expressed hope that the government might support a revival here, too. Others are trying to carry on the tradition themselves.Li Zhuangxin, a trim 17-year-old, has been studying the wing chun technique for more than four years. He was inspired by his grandfather, a devotee of the fighting style hung ga who gave Mr. Li his first kung fu lesson at age 8.He hopes to open his own kung fu school one day — maybe on the mainland, where interest is higher and rents are cheaper — and has already set up a small wing chun club, with eight members, at his high school.Few of his classmates had ever heard of wing chun before. Mr. Li, undaunted, says he wants to impart “the concentration and determination of kung fu” to his friends, who he laments are “only interested in playing with their cellphones.” Continue reading the main story

Toots Thielemans in New York in 2008. The jazz harmonica player first garnered widespread international attention by playing guitar and whistling in unison.

            Nicholas Roberts for The New York Times        


Toots Thielemans, one of the only musicians to have a successful career as a jazz harmonica player, died on Monday in Brussels. He was 94.The death was confirmed by Mr. Thielemans’s agency, which did not specify a cause. Mr. Thielemans, who retired in 2014 for health reasons, had been hospitalized recently with a broken arm.That Mr. Thielemans played jazz on the harmonica was unusual enough. Even more unusual was how he first gained international attention: by playing guitar and whistling in unison.He introduced this approach in 1961 on his recording of the wistful but jaunty jazz waltz “Bluesette,” which he wrote.The record became an international hit, and the song was his signature. It also became a jazz standard, recorded by numerous instrumentalists, among them Chet Atkins, Tito Puente and Mr. Thielemans himself, who went on to record it several more times. It was also recorded, with lyrics by Norman Gimbel, by Sarah Vaughan and other singers.
But his distinctive sound on the chromatic harmonica was Mr. Thielemans’s primary claim to fame and, especially, to fortune.Although his name was well known in the jazz world — he performed with greats like Ella Fitzgerald, Benny Goodman and Charlie Parker — it was relatively unknown to the general public; his playing, on the other hand, was virtually ubiquitous.It can be heard on the soundtracks of movies like “Midnight Cowboy” and “The Getaway.” It was featured in television commercials and on records by, among many others, Ms. Fitzgerald, Paul Simon, Billy Joel, Dizzy Gillespie and Quincy Jones, who once called Mr. Thielemans “one of the greatest musicians of our time.” For more than four decades, it has been heard in the opening theme music of “Sesame Street.”Jean-Baptiste Frédéric Isidore Thielemans was born on April 29, 1922, in Brussels, where his parents owned a cafe. He offered various explanations over the years for how he came to be known as Toots, sometimes saying he chose the name himself and at others saying it was given to him; whatever the truth, the name was apparently borrowed from two American jazz musicians, Nuncio Mondello and Salvador Camarata, who both went by Toots.Musically inclined from an early age, he began playing the accordion at 3 and took up the harmonica in his teens. A few years later, inspired by Django Reinhardt, a fellow Belgian, he began playing guitar, as well. By the end of World War II he had become a full-time musician.In 1949, he shared the stage with Charlie Parker at the Paris Jazz Festival, and a year later he toured Europe as the guitarist in a sextet led by Benny Goodman. He moved to the United States in 1951 and eventually became a citizen.From 1953 to 1959, he was a member of the British jazz pianist George Shearing’s popular quintet. He mostly played guitar with Mr. Shearing, but his harmonica work was featured on at least one number at every performance. It was also showcased on the handful of albums he recorded as a leader in those years.After leaving the Shearing group, Mr. Thielemans became a busy studio musician, even spending a few years on staff at ABC. But he remained active in jazz, with the harmonica now his main instrument. He toured frequently, and occasionally recorded as the leader of a small group, for the rest of his life.
Most of his albums presented him in a straightforward jazz context, but late in his career they took on a more international color. On “The Brasil Project,” released in 1992, and a follow-up, released the next year, he collaborated with Milton Nascimento, Gilberto Gil and other prominent Brazilian artists. And on the 1998 album “Chez Toots” he returned to his roots, leading a group of French and Belgian musicians in a program of French songs.Playing a set in New York a few months after turning 80, Mr. Thielemans “seemed dazzled by his glorious sunset, and found shelter under the umbrella of sophisticated schmaltz,” Ben Ratliff wrote in The New York Times, adding: “He’s in good shape, only losing wind at the end of a long string of notes; but he finds off-centered rhythms, attaining a little bit of freedom, knocking his instrument from side to side for tremolos.”Albert II, then the king of Belgium, bestowed on Mr. Thielemans the honorary title of baron in 2001. The country’s prime minister, Charles Michel, said on Monday, “We have lost a great musician, a warm personality.”The National Endowment for the Arts named Mr. Thielemans a jazz master for 2009, the highest honor that can be accorded a jazz musician in the United States. “I accept this distinction with pride and emotion,” he said at the time, adding that he had only “played at music” until a Louis Armstrong record in 1940 provided “instant contamination” and changed the direction of his life.Mr. Thielemans lived in La Hulpe, a suburb of Brussels. Information on survivors was not immediately available.

In March 2006, Mr. Thielemans was the guest of honor at an all-star Carnegie Hall tribute concert, with the pianist Herbie Hancock and the clarinetist Paquito D’Rivera among the performers. Reviewing the concert for The Times, Nate Chinen praised both Mr. Thielemans’s “exuberantly expressive” playing and his infectious spirit.“No one stole the spotlight from Mr. Thielemans,” he wrote. “He was having giddy fun, and the feeling was contagious.”

Although Mr. Mahdi is suspected of committing other crimes, legal experts said the case had been narrowly focused to highlight the growing awareness in international justice that cultural destruction is not only a war crime but also an intrinsic part of warfare aimed at destroying an opponent’s history and identity.“The courts have been slow to recognize this, but there is a clear link between crimes committed against people and attacks on their cultural heritage,” said Andras Riedlmayer, a scholar of Islamic art and architecture at Harvard.“The ethnic cleansers in the Balkans, like the jihadis in Iraq, Syria and Timbuktu and other places, are keenly aware of the significance of this, which is why they devote so much personnel and resources to the destruction of religious and cultural landmarks,” Mr. Riedlmayer said.Mr. Mahdi’s guilty plea is likely to drastically change the course of what might have been a lengthy trial that would have involved bringing witnesses to The Hague from Timbuktu and other West African desert cities where jihadists held sway for almost a year.Under court rules, there will be a few days of hearings to provide judges with more evidence to evaluate the scope of the case and to determine a sentence.But even without a formal trial, the case, in which the hearings were broadcast by court video, was expected to attract wide interest.
The trial comes amid heightened international concern about the fate of many cultural and religious monuments in the Middle East and North Africa, where sites of early civilization have deteriorated or been razed in armed conflicts.Numerous places of worship, archaeological remains, libraries, museums and other treasured sites have been destroyed by Islamist groups because they are seen to represent heretical values.The Taliban were condemned internationally when militants blew up the giant Buddha statues at Bamiyan in 2001. More recently, the Islamic State proudly distributed images showing its leveling of Nimrud and other pre-Islamic sites in Iraq, and it destroyed parts of the temples of Palmyra in Syria.

No international court has jurisdiction over crimes in Iraq and Syria, nor over the continuing cultural devastation reported in Yemen.The Mali case has its roots in 2012, when armed rebels and homegrown Islamic jihadists allied with Al Qaeda established a breakaway ministate in the northern half of Mali that lasted about a year.Western diplomats feared that the jihadists would set up an Islamic State-like territory in Timbuktu and elsewhere to serve as a base of operations that could draw in other foreign fighters from across the region.At first, several hundred fighters, including men from Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Senegal and Tunisia, moved into the region, where they recruited locals to help subdue the inhabitants as they imposed their harsh form of Islam. Mr. Mahdi, who was born in the region, was one of the local recruits.Critics in Mali have described Mr. Mahdi as no more than a midlevel operative and have said that others in Timbuktu had greater power and responsibility.
Some jihadists fled after French troops drove them out in 2013, and others appeared to have received amnesty after peace talks. Mr. Mahdi was the only one to end up in court in The Hague.He was arrested in Niger by French troops when they intercepted a jihadist convoy smuggling weapons from Libya. After being held in Niger for a year, he was sent to The Hague.In and around Timbuktu, most of the destroyed tombs have been rebuilt in the traditional masonry with funds from foreign donors.Tensions are still high in the once-thriving trading town often visited by pilgrims and tourists. Jihadists and bandits roam the area, and not all of those who fled have returned — notably women, who were particular targets.Alice Banens, a lawyer for the International Federation for Human Rights, said lawsuits had been filed in Mali on behalf of women and girls who had been raped. She said that numerous women had been forced to marry jihadists, and that others were captured and used as sexual slaves by the foreign fighters.They have also asked the court to expand the charges against Mr. Mahdi, arguing that his morality brigade was an accomplice to the abuse, she said.There are some precedents in modern international law for giving cultural destruction a more central place among war crimes.The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has handed down convictions for the shelling of architectural jewels in the Croatian city of Dubrovnik and the Bosnian city of Mostar. The court found that the attacks were not justified for military reasons, but that they had been intended to break the people’s morale.
In Bosnia, where Serbia waged a three-year campaign to drive Muslims from their homes in the 1990s, close to 1,200 mosques were damaged or destroyed to discourage Bosnian Muslims from returning, researchers at the court found. Catholic and Orthodox churches were also destroyed in the Bosnian conflict, but far fewer of them.In Mali, where 16 tombs were destroyed and some ancient mosques disfigured, the numbers may seem relatively small.But Stephen J. Rapp, a former prosecutor and former United States ambassador at large to tribunals handling cases of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, said, “the Mali case is useful because it could help persuade other nations to pursue similar charges relating to Syria and Iraq, where no international court has yet jurisdiction.”In an interview, Mr. Rapp said that Mr. Mahdi’s case was noteworthy “because this is not about a foot soldier killing or smashing things, but about an ideologue, someone who was given authority and who gave legal advice to the local Islamic court.”At the end of his prepared statement to the court on Monday, Mr. Mahdi said, “I would like to give a piece of advice to all Muslims in the world not to get involved in the same acts I got involved with, because they will not lead to any good for humanity.” Continue reading the main story

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, whose capital, Tokyo, will host the 2020 Summer Games, appeared as Super Mario during the Olympic closing ceremony in Rio de Janeiro.

TOKYO — Everyone knew that Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan, was headed to Rio to represent the country that will host the 2020 Summer Olympics. But viewers who tuned into the broadcast of Rio’s closing ceremony on Monday morning Japan time were surprised to see their normally sober leader pop out of an oversize green drainpipe dressed as Super Mario, the star of the popular Nintendo video game series.Mr. Abe’s appearance followed a glossy promotional video showing athletes in stereotypical scenes from Tokyo, as well as various characters from popular culture, including Hello Kitty and Doraemon. The scene cut to Mr. Abe in a taxi, fretting that he wouldn’t make it to Rio on time, followed by an animated Super Mario diving into a green pipe in Tokyo, emerging as a human figure from the green pipe on the field in Rio de Janeiro. When his costume fell off, the prime minister emerged, holding a red ball and waving a red cap, a shadow of a smile on his face.Reaction on social media in Japan was swift and amused, with “Abe Mario” the top trending topic on Twitter.

One user, @kirifurikogen, said: “Wow, I thought a middle-aged uncle cosplaying as Mario was going to come out in the middle of the live closing ceremony at the Rio Games. But that’s PM Abe!”In a note of wry political humor, one tweet referred to Mr. Abe’s nationalist leanings, including a long-running controversy over Yasukuni, the large shrine in central Tokyo that honors the nation’s war dead, including convicted war criminals. When political leaders visit the shrine, they draw strong reactions from China and South Korea. Mr. Abe has only visited the shrine once during his time as prime minister.

The promotional video and Olympic performance were developed by the Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. An outline of the performance was given to reporters covering the Rio Games in advance, but it only mentioned “a surprise guest from Japan!”With Super Mario featured in the Tokyo 2020 promotion, even Nintendo’s stock seemed to get a boost, rising more than 3 percent in Tokyo trading.

The Business Roundtable, an association representing the chief executives of some of the largest American companies, has held events in more than 120 congressional districts during lawmakers’ summer recess.Last week, with families making back-to-school purchases, the lobbying association for footwear companies circulated a report concluding that Americans could save $4 billion on children’s shoes if T.P.P. takes effect and cuts tariffs on imports from Vietnam and elsewhere.Environmental and labor groups have been active, too, holding “Rock against the T.P.P.” concerts in several cities and flying protest blimps outside lawmakers’ offices.“Even the most ardent supporters of the bill, which would include us, would say, ‘Please don’t put a bill on the floor if you don’t have the votes,’” said Bill Miller, a vice president at the Business Roundtable. “The parties have been working pretty well to get resolution, but they’re not there yet.”Talks have begun between administration officials, chiefly Mr. Obama’s trade ambassador, Michael B. Froman, and Republican leaders, including Mr. Brady and Senator Orrin G. Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. But essential negotiations over Republican objections are not likely to take place until Republicans decide Congress will act.
Mr. Brady and others cite progress in addressing lawmakers’ concerns about Japanese pork, labor rights in Mexico and financial companies’ data protections. But other issues remain.Many Republicans and the tobacco industry object that the tobacco companies would be barred from using international trade tribunals to sue countries that restrict smoking. More problematic is the complaint of Republicans, led by Mr. Hatch, and the pharmaceutical industry that the agreement would undercut drug makers’ intellectual property protections on the advanced drugs known as biologics. The issue was the last to be settled among the T.P.P. countries in October; other nations demanded fewer years of protection, to hasten the production of less costly generics.Mr. Hatch, in a statement, also said he wanted to see written plans from the T.P.P. nations on how they would “abide by their commitments.” 



                The Trans-Pacific Partnership, Explained            

                The trade deal has become a flashpoint American politics, opposed by the presidential nominees of both major parties as a symbol of failed globalism and the loss of United States jobs overseas.            



“Those issues have to be addressed in a positive way before we can move forward,” Mr. Brady said, echoing the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. “But the White House really needs to pick up the pace if we’re going to consider it this year.”Yet satisfying Republicans, who not only run Congress but also provide the bulk of pro-trade votes, risks costing critical Democratic votes.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement, “Republicans have made clear they want to gut the public health, pharmaceutical, labor and environmental provisions, which President Obama has said he will not do, and which I strongly oppose.”The White House cannot afford to lose much support. The template vote is Congress’s narrow approval last year of a “fast track” law that cleared the way for final negotiations on the Pacific pact, by allowing an up-or-down vote without amendments that could unravel the agreement.In the House, all 28 Democratic supporters remain on board, both sides say. While House Republicans have not counted yet whether they still have at least 190 votes for T.P.P., Mr. Brady said, pro-trade Republicans “are in a good place” if the outstanding issues get resolved.
But the climate has shifted for the traditionally pro-trade party. A new poll from the Pew Research Center found that since May 2015 — just before Mr. Trump began his campaign — the percentage of Republican and Republican-leaning voters with negative views of trade pacts increased 22 percentage points, to 61 percent.Last week, Senator Patrick Toomey, a Republican fighting for re-election in Pennsylvania, announced he had switched against T.P.P., following Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, who did so after becoming Mrs. Clinton’s running mate.Of the 60 senators who supported the fast-track bill last year, at least five have now come out against T.P.P. It will need at least 50 votes, assuming Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is the tiebreaker.“There is a big gap between the rhetoric of the campaign and even in what you see in the polls,” Mr. Froman said. “It’s going to be hard. But the votes will be there.”

And once they started portraying themselves as Swedish, they could not stop.“After the war, he’s still Swedish,” Mr. Walter said. “It was just going, going, going.”Even Mr. Trump, not known to be shy about embellishing facts, questioned the need. According to Mr. Walter, when Mr. Trump was working on his best seller “The Art of the Deal” in the mid-1980s, he asked his father, “Do I have to do this Swedish thing?”In the book, published in 1987, he wrote that his father’s story was “classic Horatio Alger,” and that his grandfather “came here from Sweden as a child.”Mr. Trump has been called to account for the discrepancy in the past, sometimes admitting it, sometimes not. In an interview in his Trump Tower office, he at first claimed not to know that his father pretended to be Swedish, saying: “Is that true? I don’t know.” He later acknowledged that the two of them would occasionally discuss the concealment of their heritage, explaining that his father “didn’t want to put any pressure” on his Jewish friends.“It was a very tough time,” he said.“We have a war, we are fighting a war with Germany,” said Mr. Trump, who was born a year after World War II ended.Mr. Trump’s family history was recounted by Mr. Walter in an interview and was also the subject of “The Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a Presidential Candidate,” a family biography by Gwenda Blair. It is the kind of story that echoes the hopefulness and travails of many immigrants still today, and one that many a politician has trumpeted to gain an advantage.
Though a pillar of Mr. Trump’s campaign is stopping the flow of immigrants entering the country illegally and deporting them en masse, he often voices his support of legal immigration. And his personal life has been full of émigrés.His mother, Mary Anne Trump, nee Macleod, emigrated from the Scottish Isle of Lewis at age 18, and two of Mr. Trump’s three wives were born overseas. In the interview, he even mistakenly said his father was an immigrant who “came here when he was 5.”While Mr. Trump’s German grandfather came to and stayed in America legally, he had little choice but to remain: German officials refused to restore his citizenship when he tried to move back to his hometown from the United States.“Well, he wanted to come over to this country,” Mr. Trump bristled. “And ultimately, he loved this country.”

Upon landing in New York in 1885, Friedrich Trump moved in with his older sister, who had left Kallstadt a few years earlier, and her husband at 76 Forsyth Street, in what is today the Lower East Side of Manhattan. He worked as a barber, a trade he had apprenticed for in Germany after his father, a vintner, died, leaving the family in dire economic straits.Mr. Trump and his sister’s family soon moved uptown to 17th Street, and then to 104th Street on the East Side, an area thick with his hometown’s dialect and wine.But Friedrich wanted more. At age 22, he moved to Seattle, opened and then sold a restaurant and then, with some more cash from his mother, bought the first Trump real estate: a property near Monte Cristo, Wash., a mining boom town. He staked claim to more property for gold prospecting and built hotels for prospectors.“He was a very entrepreneurial person,” Mr. Trump said.By late 1896, at age 27, he had become a justice of the peace and opened new restaurants that thrived as prospectors streamed through Seattle to the Klondike and Alaska.
Gold fever hit Friedrich Trump, too, but on the way to the Yukon he opened the popular New Arctic Restaurant and Hotel and the White Horse, which according to Ms. Blair’s book featured prostitutes as well as food and drink.(“Totally false,” said Mr. Trump, who is not a fan of the book. “There are so many false stories.”)In 1898, he and other prospectors bought a schooner and sailed toward the Yukon River, but ran aground on Chirikof Island in the Gulf of Alaska. For more than a month, the group lived off the ship’s provisions, and Friedrich began a farewell letter in German to his family. It ended abruptly: “We have hope that the United States government will now …”He and other passengers were rescued by a passing steam barkentine.Four years later, he returned to Germany and married a former neighbor, Elizabeth Christ, the daughter of a tinker, “in a lovely Lutheran church in Kallstadt,” according to Karen T. Ingraham, a granddaughter. He persuaded Elizabeth to move to America, sold off his properties in the West and invested in vacant lots in Queens.In 1904, he returned to Kallstadt with his homesick wife, but German officials turned him away, viewing his absence as a willful attempt to avoid military service. He protested, declaring, “It was my intention to remain in America forever,” according to Ms. Blair’s book.“We are loyal Germans and stand behind the high kaiser and the mighty German Reich,” he insisted.But the mighty German Reich refused to restore his citizenship.Unhappily, Friedrich and his wife, five months pregnant with Frederick Christ Trump, Donald’s father, returned to New York in 1905. Friedrich rented space for a barbershop on Wall Street, tried again to return to Germany but ultimately settled in Woodhaven, a German neighborhood of Queens.In May 1918, Friedrich, with his thick mustache and bushy eyebrows, and Fred, with his blond parted hair, were walking along the German shops of Jamaica Avenue when Friedrich said he felt ill.
“Then, he died,” Fred Trump recounted in an interview for Ms. Blair’s book. “Just like that.”Fred Trump grew up in a country suspicious of Germans, especially young German men, with fears of sabotage leading to laws barring them from boarding boats and even from entering some cities. Some sauerkraut sellers tried rebranding it “liberty cabbage.”And so the Trumps became, quietly, Swedish.In a 1950 Brooklyn Daily Eagle profile about Fred, Friedrich was identified only as a “former Klondike restaurant operator.” A 1984 cover story in The New York Times Magazine, a blown-up cardboard copy of which Mr. Trump keeps in his office, asserted that “the family is of Swedish descent.”“The Art of the Deal” kept that story alive. Mr. Trump was soon confronted with the truth, but as late as 1999, Fred Trump’s obituary in The Daily News overlooked the fact that the story had been debunked, calling him the son of “a Swedish immigrant father.”Mr. Walter, the family historian, said he had often discussed Friedrich’s life story with his cousin and how, at least in one crucial way, their grandfather was indeed not German at all.“I told Donald,” Mr. Walter said, that “if Friedrich got his citizenship back, we wouldn’t be here.”

 Correction: August 22, 2016 
An earlier version of this article described incorrectly the town of Kallstadt, Germany, where Donald J. Trump’s grandfather was from. It is in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, and is therefore not a “small Bavarian town.”

As Feyisa Lilesa of Ethiopia crossed the finish line in his silver-medal marathon run at the Rio Olympics on Sunday, he raised his arms and crossed them in an X, a gesture of protest against his country’s government that he said could get him killed if he returned home.He is uncertain where he will go next, and what will become of his wife and two children in Ethiopia.“If I go back to Ethiopia, maybe they will kill me,” he said at a news conference after the race, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. “If I am not killed, maybe they will put me in prison.”Ethiopia’s communications minister, Getachew Reda, told CNN that Mr. Lilesa “shouldn’t at all be worried” to return, calling him an “Ethiopian hero.”“I can assure you nothing is going to happen to his family; nothing is going to happen to him,” Mr. Reda said.An accomplished distance runner who has one of the 50 fastest marathon times, Mr. Lilesa defied an Olympic prohibition on political demonstrations to make his statement, raising his arms again in protest at the race’s medal ceremony.He told reporters he had not discussed the protest ahead of time with others, including his manager, teammates and family, out of fear for his safety.Soon after his gesture, Mr. Lelisa quickly attracted supporters on social media.

Antigovernment protests in Ethiopia, an American ally that has experienced stability and a growing economy over the past decade, have been growing recently, with thousands of people demanding political changes.Human rights groups say the protests have been met by brutal crackdowns by the government, including the shooting deaths of unarmed protesters. A Human Rights Watch report in June estimated that more than 400 people had been killed in seven months, almost all of them civilians.
Protesters in the Oromo ethnic group, Ethiopia’s largest, say they feel marginalized. The Tigrayan ethnic group makes up about 6 percent of the population but dominates in politics, the military and commerce.“The Ethiopian government is killing my people, so I stand with all protests anywhere, as Oromo is my tribe,” Mr. Lilesa said, according to The Washington Post. “My relatives are in prison, and if they talk about democratic rights they are killed.”Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer in central Ethiopia, predicted that the Ethiopian government will indeed treat Mr. Lelisa like a hero, at least publicly. “They will not do anything silly against that guy,” he said.“The whole world knows about him now,” Mr. Teshome said. “If they arrest him, it will be a huge mistake and create a further disturbance.”The Ethiopian government is known to be quite adept at damage control, using urbane officials to deflect criticism. So far, it seems to have worked.Human rights groups have complained for years about repression and brutality inside Ethiopia, but the government continues to maintain friendly ties with the West, which sees Ethiopia as a stable ally in a region that has been plagued by violent extremism and chaos. President Obama, for example, visited Ethiopia in 2015.Mr. Teshome said, however, that Mr. Lilesa’s act — crossing his arms at a moment when millions were watching him on TV — had been a blow to the carefully constructed image the government has tried to project.He said that many Ethiopians were impressed by Mr. Lelisa’s courage, and that “everybody is talking about it” in the town where Mr. Teshome lives, Woliso, and across social media.
But Mr. Teshome said that on Monday, the state-controlled media was not broadcasting any images of Mr. Lelisa with his arms crossed. “This was what the government was afraid of,” he said.Mr. Lelisa told reporters on Sunday he did not know where he would go next, but mentioned Kenya and the United States as possibilities, according to a video from LetsRun.com.Mr. Teshome said he expected that Mr. Lelisa would not return to Ethiopia, even if officials pledged he would be safe.“Whether they treat him well or not doesn’t make a difference; he was protesting what happens to his people, the killing of his people,” Mr. Teshome said. “We are living in a dictatorial state, a totalitarian state.”

Since its first studio album in 1989, the Hip, as the band is widely known, has risen from a riff-driven bar band to one whose dense lyrics, touching on hockey players and heroes of the Canadian wilderness, now invite close reading — “a proletarian group with an intellectual sensibility,” as the Canadian cultural essayist and novelist Stephen Marche wrote in The New Yorker. “Small-town hockey fans howl their biggest anthems in parking lots after games; assistant professors of Canadian literature listen to their later work while jogging.”

Though they’ve had a few legs up — in 1995 Dan Aykroyd, a longtime fan and fellow Canadian, brought them to play on “Saturday Night Live” — their success never translated south. But being a uniquely Canadian phenomenon (they’re on a stamp) has endeared them even further at home.“We’re a country that hasn’t really embraced its history just yet,” said the musician Kevin Drew, of Broken Social Scene. “We’re still trying to figure out what makes us Canadian, and we have one of the loudest neighbors in the world, so this band helped a country, and Gord helped people lyrically, slowly start to try to define themselves.”With Dave Hamelin, Mr. Drew was a producer on the Hip’s most recent album, “Man Machine Poem,” which was recorded, he said, before Mr. Downie’s December cancer diagnosis, and released in June, shortly after the band announced it.In the studio, Mr. Drew said, he saw the fluidity of three decades of musicianship among the Hip’s other members: the bassist Gord Sinclair, the guitarists Paul Langlois and Rob Baker, and the drummer Johnny Fay. “I saw them write a song in three minutes once,” he said. “It blew my mind.”

And Mr. Downie was as open and gung-ho as a novice. “He would be pacing around, saying, ‘Let’s go as far as we can,’” Mr. Drew said.“Gord pushes you to be your best,” he added. “That’s why people come to his shows and sing their guts out, because they feel like their best selves.”
The Hip has had a deep impact on the Canadian musical scene. Allan Reid, president and chief executive of the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, which presents the Juno Awards, the Canadian Grammys, called the Hip “the best rock band this country has ever seen.” (The band has earned 14 Junos.)Geddy Lee, frontman for Rush, for whom the Hip once opened, praised them in an email for their “blues based, sinewy, guitar rock combined with Gord’s original poetic style of lyrics.”

He attended one of their Toronto shows this month — “an incredibly heartfelt and moving experience,” he said, “one I shall never forget.”And band members continue to mentor younger acts, like Arkells, which opened for them recently. “There’s a Gord line I love,” from the record “Now for Plan A,” the Arkells singer, Max Kerman, wrote in an email: “‘We don’t want to do it. We want to be it.’ Gord committed himself to a life of music and performance art in an incredibly profound way.”At a Pearl Jam concert in Wrigley Field in Chicago on Saturday, Eddie Vedder dedicated the song “Light Years” to the Hip.“Their poetry is staggering,” said Sarah Polley, the Canadian actress and filmmaker, who covered the Hip’s song “Courage” for her 1997 film, “The Sweet Hereafter.” “They are the soundtrack of this country in so many ways.”

Ms. Polley was also at one of their recent Toronto shows.“It’s been such a gift that they’ve let us say thank you with this tour,” she said in an email. “I bought a grilled cheese sandwich yesterday and the guy serving me started talking about them and the two of us just stood there and wept together without apology or embarrassment.”The tour has also become a fund-raising mission: Mr. Downie, whose cancer, glioblastoma, is not curable, started a brain cancer research fund at the Sunnybrook Foundation, a health center affiliated with the University of Toronto, and the Canadian Cancer Society was also expecting hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations this weekend, a spokeswoman said.
“The gesture and the courageousness of doing what they were doing wasn’t lost on anyone,” said Mr. Drew, who was at shows in Toronto and Kingston. Though Mr. Downie relied on teleprompters for help with lyrics, and was not as kinetic as in the past, the performances “were exceptional,” Mr. Drew said. “The detail, the care — they were there and they were present. They pushed themselves.”In the final moments of many of their recent shows, Mr. Downie has been alone onstage, looking out into a roaring audience. “It’s an implicit goodbye, without being overt,” Mr. Lennox, the media executive and Mr. Downie’s longtime friend, said.But at the end of their show in Kingston, for their much-wondered about final song, the Hip simply played one of their biggest hits, “Ahead by a Century,” a 1996 acoustic-based pop song about childhood innocence, beloved and performed by gymnasiums full of Canadian schoolchildren for years.The night felt, Mr. Drew said, “hopeful.”

“We said, ‘This is not about you tonight, this is about us, and you can listen to what we’ve got to say for a change,’” said Kate Harrison, a resident and early member of the group.No politician has been allowed to address the group since. The village has kept the effort separate from party politics, which residents thought would only divide them along ideological lines.The project was started by Garry Charnock, a former journalist who trained as a hydrologist and has lived in the village for about 30 years. He got the idea a little more than a decade ago after attending a lecture about climate change at the Hay Festival, an annual literary gathering in Wales. He decided to try to get Ashton Hayes to become, as he put it, “Britain’s first carbon-neutral village.”“But even if we don’t,” he recalls thinking at the time, “let’s try to have a little fun.”

Sometimes, efforts to reduce greenhouse gases involve guilt-tripping or doomsday scenarios that make people feel as if the problem is too overwhelming to tackle.In Ashton Hayes — about 25 miles southeast of Liverpool, with a 19th-century Anglican church and a community-owned shop that doubles as a post office — the villagers have lightened the mood.
They hold public wine-and-cheese meetings in the biggest houses in town, “so everyone can have a look around,” and see how the wealthier people live, said Mr. Charnock, the executive director of RSK, an environmental consulting company. “We don’t ever finger-wag in Ashton Hayes.”About 650 people — more than half of the village’s residents — showed up to the first meeting, Mr. Charnock said. Some in the village were less keen, but little by little, they began to participate.Some have gone further. When they were looking to build their energy-efficient home and heard about Ashton Hayes’s carbon-neutral project, Ms. Dossett and her husband, Ian, thought it might be the perfect village for them.They moved from nearby South Warrington and found two old farm cottages, which they converted into a two-story brick house, and installed huge triple-glazed windows, photovoltaic cells on the roof, a geothermal heat pump that heats the home and its water, and an underground cistern to hold rainwater for toilets and the garden.“I wouldn’t want anyone to think we live in a mud hut,” Ms. Dossett said, sitting on a couch in her warm, well-lit living room.The Dossetts also have a vegetable garden, grow grapes for wine, brew beer and keep two cows, which mow the lawn and may also eventually become food in a few years. They pay about 500 pounds (about $650) a year for electricity and heating.The success of the carbon-neutral project seems to have inspired other community efforts in Ashton Hayes. The residents, for example, have built a new playing field with a solar-powered pavilion, which is the home of a community cafe three days a week. They have also put photovoltaic solar panels on the roof of the primary school.Other towns and cities around the world hope to copy Ashton Hayes. Their representatives have contacted the project’s leaders, asking for help in setting up similar initiatives, according to the diary the Ashton Hayes group keeps about the project, chronicling almost everything they have done over the past 10 years.
Eden Mills, a small community in Ontario, Canada, is one of them. Charles Simon traveled to Ashton Hayes in 2007 to learn how to translate their approach to his town, adopting the apolitical, voluntary, fun method.“Some of the changes are so easy,” Mr. Simon said. “Just put on a sweater instead of turning on the heat.”





Eden Mills has cut emissions by about 14 percent, Mr. Simon said, and has plans to do more. Residents have been working with experts from the nearby University of Guelph, planting trees in the village forest to help absorb the carbon dioxide the town emits, Mr. Simon said.Janet Gullvaag, a councilwoman in Notteroy, Norway, an island municipality of about 21,000 people, reached out to Ashton Hayes about nine years ago after her political party decided to include reducing carbon dioxide emissions in its platform.“I think that the idea that Ashton Hayes had — to make caring for the environment fun, without pointing fingers — was quite revolutionary,” Ms. Gullvaag said.Though her community’s approach is decidedly more political, Ms. Gullvaag said that adopting Ashton Hayes’s mantra of fun had paid dividends: She has seen changes in her community, she said, as people buy more electric cars and bicycles, and convert their home heating from oil to more environmentally friendly sources.“Whatever you’re trying to do, if you can create enthusiasm and spread knowledge, normally, people will react in a positive way,” she added.Though deep cuts across the globe are still required to make broader progress, actions to reduce emissions, even by small towns, are a step in the right direction, say experts who study community action on climate change.
“The community-building element of all this has been as important as the environmental impact so far,” said Sarah Darby, a researcher at Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute.She added that Ashton Hayes was in a good position to take on these kinds of projects — it is a small village of well-off and well-educated people, so simply taking fewer flights each year can have a big effect.Residents were able to cut emissions by about 20 percent in the first year alone, according to surveys used to calculate carbon footprints that were developed by Roy Alexander, a local professor, and his students.Some have had even more significant reductions: Households that participated in surveys in both the first and 10th years shrank their energy use by about 40 percent.Mr. Charnock said he thought the village could get the cuts in its 2006 carbon footprint to 80 percent in the next few years with the help of grant money to buy and install solar panels on the local school and other buildings.The next thing they have to do, he said, is to get the county government to be as committed to cutting emissions as Ashton Hayes is.“There’s so much apathy,” Mr. Charnock said. “We need to squeeze that layer of apathy jelly and get it out.”

John Child, the managing director of Sandcastle, said that the park had the capacity to receive about 80,000 visitors per month, and that it was considering expansion.“Accessibility is an important part of domestic tourism, especially with an aging society,” he said. “It’s worth millions.”With a drop of more than 10 percent in the value of the pound since Britain’s so-called Brexit vote on June 23 to withdraw from the European Union, vacations abroad have suddenly become significantly more expensive for working-class families who might have considered a trip to France, Spain or Italy. Then there is fresh anxiety, too, about terrorism on the Continent.“We’re reminding people that the value of their pound in Blackpool is exactly the same as it was in June,” said Alan Cavill, the director of tourism for Blackpool, which is almost wholly reliant on domestic visitors. Only about 1 percent of its 17 million visitors each year come from outside Britain.



“We think we’ll benefit from Brexit, but there are other factors, too,” said Gillian Campbell, the deputy leader of Blackpool’s Labour Party-controlled City Council. “It’s the fear of the unknown abroad; there are all kinds of things to worry about.”It is still soon after the Brexit vote, but operators of Blackpool’s hotels and attractions have said visits have increased by about 3 percent over last year, including more overnight stays.
That fits with figures from VisitEngland, which in a survey through mid-July reported that half of accommodation businesses believed that Brexit would cause an increase in domestic visitors. If they are right, the gains will come on top of solid growth for domestic travel last year, when domestic holiday trips and spending were up 7 percent.A market-research firm, GfK, said that because of the Brexit referendum and renewed fears of terrorism abroad, 20 percent of Britons — and 30 percent of those with higher incomes — were more likely to consider either domestic holidays or short breaks.

A survey by Britain’s Automobile Association suggested that one in every 14 people who had intended to vacation abroad, especially families and students, had abandoned those plans. Half of those surveyed said they would switch their vacations to Britain.In June, more than two-thirds of those voting in Blackpool opted to leave the European Union, even though the city had received 25 million pounds in European aid since 2005 to help modernize the seafront, repair sea walls, renovate the seafront tramway and improve the Winter Gardens and Blackpool Tower. Both the Winter Gardens and the tower were bought by the city in 2010, but are operated by private companies like Merlin Entertainments, which owns Madame Tussauds, Legoland and the London Eye.The Brexit vote reflected the tenor of northern England, where the wealth of the south and the preoccupations of the national government can seem far away.“We don’t care much for Europe here. We don’t need it,” James Martin said as he walked against the wind on the blustery seafront. “We’re self-sufficient, pretty much.”

Andrew Waddington, 31, came with his wife and four children from Burnley, less than an hour’s drive away, where he is a sales manager for a foreign truck company. He was an enthusiastic Brexit supporter, and unsympathetic to the angst the decision had provoked in the financial markets.“If billionaires lose a million quid overnight, we’re supposed to cry for them?” he asked.At 518 feet tall, Blackpool’s tower opened in 1894, just five years after the Eiffel Tower, which inspired it. By 1899, it was already being fancied up in response to successful tourism.
The tower’s base contained a zoo with lions and tigers and, in 1904, 40 polar bears. It featured a purpose-built circus with Orientalist décor that is still in constant use (though now without animals), complete with its working Victorian-era hydraulics, which allow the ring to descend into a pool of water; a gilded ballroom, where couples still go to eat and dance; and, of course, the viewing platform at the top, providing long sightlines over the city, the beachfront promenade and the cold Irish Sea.The old Blackpool is still here — penny arcades, still popular with children; the Pleasure Beach amusement park; beer at 1.95 pounds per pint; the smell of fish and chips; and signs that advertise “news and booze” and “slots of fun.” There are even some people who come wanting to spend more on beer than on their accommodations.





But Blackpool is not catering to a class of tourists that no longer really exists. Instead the city is trying to lure more visitors for stays of three nights or more, while promoting better hotels and fewer old-fashioned bed-and-breakfast places. The Council is planning an extension of the modern tramway from the railway station to the beach and a modern conference center — complete with air conditioning — that would be attached to the Winter Gardens, hoping to again attract political party conventions.There is both a toughness and a sweetness here, a strong regional and class consciousness and pride.Even as the Blackpool Tower spiffs itself up — with a 4D movie featuring diving gulls and sea spray, and costing more than 860,000 pounds — there is nostalgia, too, with its circus and ballroom and its sense of a prettified past. It attracts nearly 9,000 visitors each day.A photo from 1929 on the wall of the tower features three young women in summer dresses, with their hair blowing and smiles on their faces, standing with the tower in the background. One of the young women is Lillian Bullen. Her granddaughter Kate Shane manages Merlin Entertainments’s Blackpool offerings.Ms. Shane remembers Lilly, who lived to be 95, with great fondness. “I have strong memories of her as a kid, going to the circus with the performing animals,” Ms. Shane said. “And I remember going with her to Roberts’ Oyster Bar,” a famous wood-paneled restaurant that opened in 1876, but is today reduced to a shabby, shopfront shellfish stall.And now the photo of Lilly is available on a tea towel, and a pretty mug made in Thailand — both for sale in the gift shop.

Mosquitoes. Flies. Cockroaches. The bugs that thrive in the heat of summer vex Chinese urban dwellers just as they do in most of the world.But in China, some insects are viewed not as pests, but as pets — especially if they sing for their supper.Chirping bugs like katydids, cicadas and crickets are prized throughout the country, collected by children and old men who keep them in clay vessels or bamboo cages and nourish them with grains of rice and razor-thin slices of green onion.Crickets are even bred for their fighting prowess, and a pedigreed champion can be worth hundreds of dollars. But typical crooners can be bought for a few dollars.

“Summer isn’t complete without the sound of a singing katydid in your courtyard,” said Wang Xiaoming, 68, a lifelong Beijing resident who lives in a traditional hutong neighborhood, a warren of narrow alleys that are the last bastion of many Chinese traditions.In contrast to the soft trill of the field cricket, cicadas and katydids produce the kind of deafening hiss that can drown out conversation.
The practice of collecting singing insects is said to have begun 2,000 years ago. They were sought as good-luck talismans, and later as companions for imperial concubines, who kept them in gilded cages.The insects are embedded in Chinese culture. Ancient poems praise their melodious songs, and many idiomatic expressions use crickets and grasshoppers as metaphors for fertility, friendship or the passage of time.The keeping of insects faded during the 1950s and ’60s, when Mao Zedong waged war on traditions deemed bourgeois and retrograde. But it has been revived in recent years by aficionados like Mr. Wang, a retired professor of Chinese literature, who is worried about its future. “Young people would rather play with their phones than an insect,” he said.There is, of course, a downside to befriending singing insects: They are among the most ephemeral of pets. Most live for just a few months, and even the most pampered katydid will be silenced by the first autumn frost.

It’s time to start thinking inside the box.Countries are regularly compared with one another politically, financially or militarily — so why not rectangularly?That’s what David Barry, a statistician in Australia, did recently in a post on his blog. A comment by a friend on Facebook about the “remarkably rectangular country” of Turkey got Mr. Barry thinking about how it might compare with other countries in that regard. He devised a method to take the area inside a country’s borders and measure its “maximum percentage overlap with a rectangle of the same area.”Ranking countries and other territories — 208 in all — in this way, he found that Egypt was the most rectangular and the Maldives the least. Yemen, Ghana, Macedonia and Ivory Coast are also in the top 10, while island nations like Indonesia, the Bahamas, Seychelles and Tonga squiggle their way into the bottom 10.Turkey is actually the 15th most rectangular country, according to Mr. Barry’s algorithm, which has drawn the attention of websites like Gizmodo and CityLab.Is it good or bad for a country to be more rectangular? Mr. Barry’s analysis does not go into those implications. Nor does it address the consequences of the straight-line borders that were often drawn by colonial powers with little regard for indigenous peoples and cultures. All it is meant to be is another way to look at the geometry of the world. (Inspired by Mr. Barry’s project, Gonzalo Ciruelos created a method to determine the roundest country. It’s Sierra Leone — which is also the 14th most rectangular.)And yet, the human imagination cannot be bound by perpendicular lines. Looking at a map of Italy (No. 191 on the rectangularity index), it’s hard not to see a boot. The entire Korean Peninsula might strike some people as the outline of a rabbit sitting up on its hindquarters (South Korea is No. 44, North Korea is No. 158). And Sri Lankans are probably weary of their country (No. 40) being referred to as the teardrop of India (No. 132).

Young people protested Britain’s vote to leave the European Union in London last month.

Credit
            Andrew Testa for The New York Times        


The British vote to leave the European Union has had many consequences, among them a plunge in sterling, sagging business confidence, an identity crisis in Britain’s two main political parties, confusion and uncertainty. One of its less-known results is that my daughter Adele is now contemplating becoming a Pole.“Dad,” she said to me the other night over dinner in Brooklyn, “if Britain starts up this Article 50 thing, I’m going to get Polish citizenship.” Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty lays out how a country quits the European Union. Because it is in a muddle over what to do, the British government has not yet triggered this procedure. But it almost certainly will.On the face of it, Adele’s choice is a curious one. The Nazis gassed her maternal great-grandmother Frimeta Gelband in Poland. Adele’s grandmother Amalia Gelband, aged 11 in 1942, found herself alone in Nazi-occupied Poland, a Jewish girl hounded. She changed her name to Helena Kowalska, passed herself off as a Catholic, found work on a farm, and survived Germany’s attempted annihilation of European Jewry.After the war, Polish authorities stuck Amalia in a Jewish orphanage in Krakow, where she remained for three years. All she wanted of Poland was to get out of it. Her mother, her cousins, aunts and uncles had all been slaughtered.Amalia Baranek, her married name, is now a Brazilian citizen living in Rio. She has been celebrating the wondrous Olympics that have just ended. She has little time for denigrators of Brazil, the country that took her in. She has been living in Rio since 1948, the year she was at last reunited with her father, who had left Poland shortly before the war. There is no prouder Brazilian than Amalia. She knows a country whose spirit is generous.
Adele, who is 18 and a sophomore at the University of Southern California, adores her Brazilian grandmother. Still, she’s ready to become a Pole.I am not sure whom to blame for this, or whether blame is the right word (see below). The world was full of fear and anger in the 1930s, enough to propel a hatemonger to power in Germany. It is full of fear and anger again today, enough to propel Britain out of the European Union and a man as flawed as Donald Trump to the brink of the American presidency.





The troubled psyche requires a scapegoat. For Hitler, it was the Jews, among others. Today scapegoats are sought everywhere for the widespread feeling that something is amiss: that jobs are being lost; that precariousness has replaced security; that incomes are stagnant or falling; that politicians have been bought; that the bankers behind the 2008 meltdown got off unscathed; that immigrants are free riders; that inequality is out of control; that tax systems are skewed; that terrorists are everywhere.These scapegoats, on either side of the Atlantic, include Syrian refugees, African migrants, Polish workers in Britain, Mexicans, Muslims and, now that it’s open season for hatred, just about anyone deemed “foreign.”There is not much new under the sun. As Rudyard Kipling observed: “All good people agree, / And all good people say, / All nice people, like Us, are We / And everyone else is They.”After the madness against “everyone else” comes remorse. The descendants of families murdered in or driven out of Poland during the Holocaust are now eligible to apply for ancestral citizenship. Some of Adele’s close relatives have already become Poles.Of course, a Polish passport today is also a passport to work anywhere in the European Union, the greatest political creation of the second half of the 20th century, a borderless union of half a billion people (at least until Britain leaves). Young people — including all the young Britons who voted overwhelmingly to remain — want to live, love and work anywhere in Europe they choose.Adele is one of them. She loves London, where she completed high school. She loves its openness. She cannot believe her British passport may soon — unless sanity is somehow restored — no longer be a European Union passport. And so Poland beckons, just as Germany, with a similar law, has beckoned since Brexit for some British Jews of German origin. History comes full circle.
In a way, this doubling back is right. Adele owes her existence to a brave Pole named Miecyslaw Kasprzyk, who in 1942 risked his life to hide Amalia in the attic of his family’s farmhouse near Krakow. He knew the Gelband family, had been outraged by the killing of Jews and wondered in disbelief, as he once said to me, “How can you not help, if a child asks?”

Kasprzyk told me something else: “Someone who does not know the difference between good and evil is worth nothing. In fact, such a person belongs in a mental institution.”Plenty of Poles collaborated, but some did not. May Kasprzyk’s moral clarity inspire Adele, as a Pole or not, and may the world never again descend into the darkness he felt bound to resist.

On Aug. 11 and 12, coordinated bombings and arson attacks in tourist destinations in seven provinces of peninsular Thailand killed four people and injured 35. No group claimed responsibility, and senior officials of the military government almost immediately decided that the bombings were not acts of terrorism. They also dismissed any link to Malay-Muslim militants who have been waging a separatist insurgency for the past 13 years in the four southernmost provinces.A police spokesman said, “Thailand doesn’t have conflicts regarding religion, ethnicity, territory or minority groups.”That was an astounding statement in view of the insurgency by ethnic nationalists in the Malay-Muslim majority provinces, where violence has killed some 6,500 people since the beginning of 2004.The prime minister, Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, rushed to imply that blame should be directed at domestic political opponents loyal to two former prime ministers, Thaksin Shinawatra and his sister Yingluck Shinawatra, who opposed a new constitution, drafted by the military, that assured continued power for Thailand’s ruling military clique. Voters approved the draft constitution on Aug. 7, amid heavy restrictions on campaigning against the charter.Several opponents of the government, including members of the Thaksin loyalists’ Red Shirt movement have been detained, even though the bombings do not conform to the modus operandi of earlier violence associated with pro-Thaksin groups. Neither do they bear significant similarities to the bombing of a Hindu shrine in central Bangkok in August 2015 that killed 20 people.
The bombings do, however, bear the hallmarks of operations by the Patani-Malay National Revolutionary Front, which is known as the B.R.N. and is the main group fighting for the independence of the Malay-Muslim south of the country. The attacks were coordinated over several provinces, often employing two or more improvised explosive devices timed to detonate in sequence. The devices were small and, although lethal, were not designed or deployed to cause mass casualties. Also consistent with B.R.N. operations, there was no claim of responsibility.Thai police investigators, contradicting the government’s narratives, said the bombs were typical of those used by militants in Thailand’s deep south. On Aug. 15, Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan conceded that the bombers might have been hired from the ranks of southern militants.





Thai authorities have a long record of ascribing acts of violence to domestic political rivals. In 1993, after militants set fire to 33 schools across the three southernmost provinces, some senior officials blamed “the old power clique,” who had lost influence following a recent change in government. Following a car-bomb explosion in the garage of a shopping center on the tourist island Koh Samui in April 2015, senior officials blamed a group of politicians who had lost power after a coup the year before.These allegations were never substantiated, and the police eventually linked the bombing to other attacks in the deep south. Officials also tried to implicate Red Shirts in the bombing of a Bangkok shrine last year.Why is the military government so anxious to deflect attention from the Malay-Muslim insurgency? First, officials deny that Thailand is a target for terrorism, especially terrorism arising from a chronic domestic insurgency. One goal is to protect Thailand’s vital tourism industry, which indirectly contributes 20 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.Second, the military characterizes the insurgency as “disturbances” perpetrated by misguided individuals, which serves to minimize its political implications. Many Thai officials harbor a deep fear of international intervention, which they believe would eventually lead to partition. Further, acknowledging the recent attacks as the work of Malay-Muslim militants would also mean confronting the Thai military’s own counterinsurgency failures. Voters in the three southernmost provinces emphatically rejected the draft constitution, reflecting the region’s antipathy to the military and its centralization of power.It is true that southern insurgents have largely refrained from attacking Thai targets outside the four southernmost provinces. But there are plausible explanations for why they might have decided to expand their operations now.Last year, the International Crisis Group, an independent conflict-prevention organization, noted the possibility that the insurgents, faced with stalemate and diminishing returns from routine attacks in the deep south, might strike in tourist areas outside the traditional conflict zone. The senior leaders of the B.R.N. have rejected the military government’s faltering peace process, which to them seems designed to maintain a semblance of talks without the substance of negotiations. Now, the referendum result may have revealed the futility of expecting to engage with an elected government in Bangkok, since the draft constitution entrenches the military government’s power for at least another six years.
If, as available information indicates, Malay militants perpetrated the recent attacks, then the conflict has entered a disturbing new phase. For 13 years, the insurgency has had little effect on the lives of most Thais outside the deep south. Now, a wider insurgency risks stoking militant Buddhism and sectarian conflict.Early last year, in spite of a ban on political gatherings of five or more people, large Buddhist demonstrations were held against a halal-industry zone in Chiang Mai and the construction of a new mosque in Nan Province in northern Thailand. Last October, a monk in Bangkok urged that a mosque be burned for every monk killed in the deep south.It would be shortsighted and self-defeating of the generals running Thailand to insist on dismissing these latest attacks as a partisan vendetta unconnected to the conflict in the south. They should recognize the insurgency as a political problem requiring a political solution. That means restoring the rights of freedom of expression and assembly to Thai citizens, engaging in genuine dialogue with militants, and finding ways to devolve power to the region.

Claudio Ranieri, the Leicester City F.C. manager, knows he has another tough season ahead of him. ‘‘I’m the underdog. Always will be. And I love it,’’ he said.

Leicester, England — If you ever wonder why English soccer is so popular around the world, despite its lack of recent international success, you should come to Leicester City F.C.’s training ground and meet the team’s manager, Claudio Ranieri.In the world of soccer, Mr. Ranieri is a legend. He’s just won the Premier League, his first major title, at 64. And he did it with lowly Leicester, which had never won anything in its 132-year history. This time last year, the bookmakers gave the team 5,000-to-1 odds to win the Premier title. They gave Bono a better chance of becoming the next pope.The Leicester players were a strange mix, a truly European affair — two rejects from Manchester United (Danny Drinkwater and Danny Simpson), two young hopefuls from the French second division (N’Golo Kanté and Riyad Mahrez), a Japanese player dropped from the German Bundesliga (Shinji Okazaki), a forward from Argentina (Leonardo Ulloa) and the striker James Vardy, a local boy who’d had a brush with the law and hated training (“The last time I lifted a weight was probably that can of Red Bull the other day,” he once said). Winning an unwinnable game or even two with this bunch is one thing; keeping it up for a whole season, leaving behind powerhouses such as Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United and City, is nothing short of a miracle.The Premier League has just kicked off, and Leicester, known as the Foxes, lost their first match, against Hull. It’s going to be a long, hard season, as the team will also be playing, for the first time, in Europe’s Champions League. Still, like much of England, Mr. Ranieri is still in thrall over the past season, even though he knows he has another tough one ahead of him. “I’m the underdog. Always will be. And I love it,” he tells me.
We talk at Leicester’s training ground, sitting on two yellow chairs beside the impeccable green pitch, while Mr. Ranieri keeps an anxious eye on the powerful sprinklers that shoot up unpredictably around us. Two hundred yards away, Buddhist monks in orange robes bless the helicopter of the team’s Thai owner, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, before he takes off. Mr. Ranieri waves at them and shouts: “Hey, over there! Don’t forget to bless my office!” It’s a dreamlike scene. So is Mr. Ranieri’s story.The son of a butcher in Rome, he used to deliver meat for his father (hence his childhood nickname, Er Fettina, or “Cutlet Boy”). He played, then coached, for many years in Southern Italy, where soccer is a rough affair.





Sitting under the leaden English sky, he recalls those early days. “I’ve coached in Pozzuoli, near Naples, with mobsters behind the bench shouting,” he says. “Now British journalists ask me: ‘Are you feeling the pressure, Mr. Ranieri?’ Pressure? What do they know about pressure?”Until now, Leicester, a medium-size Midlands city, was not known for anything much. The team’s home, King Power Stadium, is right downtown and the training ground is nearby, nestled among streets of small rowhouses. A sign pleads: “Please drive carefully. This is a residential area.”Yet this is not Mr. Ranieri’s first experience with British soccer. From 2000 to 2004 he coached Chelsea, reaching the semifinals of the Champions League. He loves it here. “Will you move to one of the great English clubs in the future?” I ask. “This is my great English club. I plan to stay at Leicester until I’m fed up of managing a soccer team.” His contract runs to 2020.Mr. Ranieri is not only a wise man and a smooth operator, whose fatherly approach works wonders. He’s also living proof that disparate cultures can work well together. A real European, if you like. “I merge English intensity with Italian tactics and teach them to my players. Not too much tactics, otherwise I’d burn them out!” he jokes.He says that if he’d been eligible he would have voted for Britain to remain in the European Union, but he’s convinced the British will find a way to make Brexit work. “Once they’ve made a decision, they pull together,” he says. And if not? “Well, then we have a problem. In the Premier League, as well. Will we be able to recruit the best European players, as we do now?”For now, the free flow of players may be working against Mr. Ranieri. The world’s best — and best paid — managers are ready for the fox hunt. The favorite to win this year may be José Mourinho at Manchester United, who just signed Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Paul Pogba, the latter for $115 million, the most expensive transfer in soccer history. Mr. Mourinho, known as the Special One, is boisterous, excitable and self-confident to the point of arrogance. He once dismissed Mr. Ranieri as “an old loser,” but later apologized.At the time, I wrote that “comparing the two is like comparing Russell Crowe and Hugh Grant — they are so different, it makes no sense.” Mr. Ranieri remembers that. As we say goodbye, he asks politely: “Could I be Russell Crowe?”
You won the Premier League with Leicester City. You can be anything you want, Claudio. Even the Gladiator on the Bench.

One night this spring she escaped, trekking for hours to her sister’s house in a nearby village. But a member of an anti-Boko Haram militia spotted her, knowing she was out of place, and notified military officials.Soldiers took her and her sister into custody in a military facility where they were kept in a locked cell and periodically questioned, she said. After seven days, soldiers took the two to Giwa barracks. She said it took two months and four days before she was released.“I was confused,” said Ms. Umar, who is now 18. “At first I thought it was unjustified. Then I just got used to it.”
For years, Nigerian forces have struggled with how to combat Boko Haram. Soldiers have been accused of carrying out arbitrary detentions, torture and killings of civilians, often without trying to distinguish fighters from the innocent.

Witnesses have even described Nigerian soldiers deliberately carrying out revenge killings against villagers, prompting the United States to block the sale of American-made attack helicopters in the past over human rights concerns.But the nation’s new president, Muhammadu Buhari, a former general from the north, was elected more than a year ago after vowing to clean up the military. Since then, Nigerian forces have made headway in routing Boko Haram from its strongholds in remote villages.Last month, the military rescued 80 women and children who had been held by Boko Haram, and officials have adopted increasing bravado about their victories against the group. Lt. Gen. Abdulrahman Dambazau, the interior minister, recently said the war against Boko Haram in the nation’s northeast “has been fought and won.”“The victims are gradually returning to their homes, and the government is rebuilding, reconciling and rehabilitating the victims,” he said.Yet Boko Haram maintains control over many pockets of the region, even some areas that were once cleared of fighters. The more than 200 kidnapped schoolgirls from the village of Chibok, whose abduction inspired the #BringBackOurGirls campaign, are still being held hostage after more than two years. Boko Haram flaunted their continued captivity in a recent video contending that some of the girls had been killed in Nigerian military airstrikes, an assertion officials have denied.In the chaotic war with Boko Haram, determining who is a victim and who is a sympathizer can be complicated.Boko Haram often kills young men and boys who refuse to join the insurgency, leading soldiers to believe that any male of fighting age found alive may be a militant.
Some of the women and girls captured by Boko Haram face death unless they agree to “marry” fighters, a term often used here to describe the rape they endure. Many of the girls are teenagers. Some are not even 10 years old. Some of the captured women bear fighters’ children.Many people in northeastern Nigeria, not just soldiers, view anyone who has been held by Boko Haram with deep suspicion, wary that they may have been swayed by the group’s violent interpretation of Islam.So in areas like Maiduguri, the birthplace of Boko Haram, where residents have witnessed the horrors inflicted by militants, the detentions have picked up some unlikely supporters.“These women can kill,” said Ann Darman, director of the Gender Equality Peace and Development Center in Maiduguri. “They are used to killing and slaughtering people. You can’t be absorbing people into your communities without deradicalizing them.”

Zainab Muhammed said she traveled to her home village this spring thinking it was safe from Boko Haram. It was not, and she and 30 other women and their children ended up being captured by the group’s fighters.Three months later, the Nigerian military invaded. “I thought I was free,” said Ms. Muhammed, who has seven children.But soldiers took the group to a federal prison instead. “It was my first time in prison,” she said. “I’d never been to jail.”For five nights, the women and children slept in a single locked cell. For about two hours a day, one by one, the military questioned the women. Do you know the boys in Boko Haram? What is your relationship to them? Are you a fighter’s wife?
“I told them no, and they believed me,” Ms. Muhammed said.On the sixth day, she and her group were released and taken to a camp for displaced people. She has been there since early June. But other women she met at the prison were left behind, she said, along with their children.“Maybe they didn’t believe them,” she said.Interviews with detainees and a detention facility employee revealed a pattern of prolonged confinement, interspersed with hours of questioning.Those determined to be militants are often imprisoned, or can surrender to a military-run “deradicalization” program, which has about 900 participants.Typically, women are questioned, but boys and men are interrogated more intensely. If they show any resistance, their legs and hands are chained in front of them, according to one employee who was not authorized to speak publicly. The screening then escalates to beatings with a stick, he said.The employee said that he had not seen anyone badly hurt in the process, and that the detainees receive food, water and access to medical care.Ms. Ali, the mother who described being held at Giwa barracks with her seven children, said she was led from the cell only twice — once the day she arrived, and once the day she was freed.She was taken under a shady tree for questions to determine her Boko Haram leanings. Each time, she said, she told the soldiers that she opposed the militants who had torn through the region. After five weeks, she said, they released her and her children, the youngest of whom was still breast-feeding.Her husband had been held in another part of the facility, away from his family. During her detention, Ms. Ali said she caught a glimpse of him through a small cell window as he was being taken for questioning. She has not heard from him since.“I just am leaving it to God,” Ms. Ali said at a camp for 8,000 other displaced people who were all waiting until their villages were safe enough to return home.

We met one morning at the beach road, which stretches for several miles along the waterfront and is lined with hotels, private homes, restaurants and boutiques. (The evictions, which have occurred periodically over the past several years, have affected only specific stretches of Tulum’s beachfront but have involved dozens of properties and businesses.)From the road, there was not much to see of his property — or what used to be his property: The walls are high and the gates were locked. So we cut through a nearby hotel that was still in business to reach the beach. At the edge of the sand, Renaud took off his sandals and removed his T-shirt, wrapping it around his head to shield it from the sun.We walked north, stopping on the stretch of sand where his guests would while away vacation days sunbathing, reading and drinking cocktails. We had no intention of entering the property; his villas, as well as the other properties seized in June, were being held by a ragtag group of security guards.

Standing on the public side of the dunes, with tourists in bikinis and board shorts strolling by, Renaud showed me the life he and his wife had built for themselves. I took notes and snapped a few photos.Suddenly, a hefty man wearing a T-shirt and shorts emerged from the shade of a tree on the property and made his way toward us, mumbling into a walkie-talkie. Other men began pouring out of several adjacent shuttered properties, and still more from the Caribbean Sea, where they had been swimming. One of the men was brandishing a large tree branch. Soon Renaud and I were encircled. The hefty man, their apparent leader, was angry and wanted to know who we were and what we were doing and why we were taking photos. He insisted we were not allowed to take photos of the shuttered properties, not even from the beach.
Things got tense very quickly. The men pressed in on Renaud and me.As I engaged the group’s leader, Renaud slipped away and hustled up the beach. A contingent of guards pursued him, hounding him to remove his shirt from his head, to take off his sunglasses, to hand over his phone — all of which he refused.“Don’t come back,” the leader told me. I asked him what would happen if I did.“Many things will happen to you,” he said.Within an hour or two, my phone lit up with messages from Mario Cruz Rodríguez, the general director of tourism for Tulum. News of the encounter had traveled through the tourism-industry grapevine, and he was a bit concerned, to say the least. He said he was going to take up the matter with the municipality’s public security officials and have the workers for the private security firm vetted.(His efforts weren’t terribly effective. Last Friday, Rodrigo Cruz, a photographer on assignment in Tulum for The New York Times, had a similar experience, though this time the men who surrounded him on the beach were carrying machetes and tried to confiscate his camera by yanking on the camera strap.)On my last day in Tulum, pickets protesting the evictions paralyzed traffic in and out of the resort town. There was also an attempted counter-coup organized by some aggrieved residents to drive out the guards from the properties seized in June. But after a brief clash at one of the properties, the plot fizzled.“Yeah, it was a bit of a joke,” one of the dispossessed property owners told me in a text message later. “Something went wrong.”That night, I met up with Mario Cruz, the tourism director. He had asked for the meeting; he was very concerned about my impression of Tulum after the events of the last two days, particularly my encounter with the guards.

“I was very worried,” he said.He presented me with a souvenir: a small stuffed figure representing a Mayan folkloric character called an Alux. It was dressed in a loincloth and carried a slingshot — “to scare thieves, pests and bad vibes away,” an accompanying leaflet explained. (I thought to myself: Tulum could use a cargo ship full of these right now.)Afterward, Mario Cruz sent a message to a group of hoteliers and others involved in the tourism sector. “Esteemed friends,” he wrote, “I share with you that we managed to repair the image damage that occurred today with the New York Times journalist. Tulum is a strong and secure destination that all of you provide day to day to our tourists.” Continue reading the main story



Business at the island’s hotels and tavernas has slumped around 80 percent, especially along the 7.5-mile stretch between Skala Sikaminias and the vacation town of Molyvos, where many of the more than 800,000 migrants who survived the crossing last year washed ashore.Mr. Valamios used to supplement his income as a fisherman by working five months of the year at Myrivilis’ Mulberry taverna, facing the bucolic port where fishermen mend yellow nets beneath oleanders and village cats prowl for fish. This year, he was asked to work just one month amid a dearth of customers. Nearly 1,000 Greeks in the area have lost seasonal employment.



Among the villagers, there is a sense of incomprehension. When the refugee crisis started in earnest, many were thrust into the role of good Samaritans. With endless generosity, they banded together to rescue thousands of Syrians, Afghans and other migrants in peril, months before humanitarian aid groups and European governments arrived to help.“The whole village is proud of what we did,” said Theano Laoumis, who helps run the To Kyma taverna. On the taverna’s beach, refugee dinghies had landed in an unceasing stream. “You didn’t know who to save first, there were so many people. But we did save them. It was only natural. That should bring good publicity, not bad.”The drop in business has hit Lesbos as Greece has struggled to emerge from a lengthy economic crisis. Some are bitter that the refugee tide has added to their woes.

“I don’t want them to come back,” said Nikos Katakouzinos, a fisherman. “They’ve done enough harm to the village and to the island.”
Yet most residents in Skala Sikaminias do not blame the migrants. Many locals are themselves descendants of Greek refugees who fled Turkey amid war with Greece in the 1920s. Today they are bewildered by criticism of Syrians and others escaping conflict and risking a perilous crossing of the Aegean, which also turned into a graveyard for more than 1,000 men, women and children whose journeys ended in tragedy.Such images surface often from the collective memory of Skala Sikaminias, now that calm has returned and the Aegean is again a flat, clear expanse.

On a recent evening, Mr. Valamios steered toward a lighthouse that many of the migrants aimed for as they neared the Greek shore from Turkey.One of his first rescues here was in 2009, before the crisis reached its apex. Refugees were already starting to come from the Middle East, and a plastic boat crammed with 20 people was sinking. He managed to rescue 10; the rest, children among them, slipped beneath the waves.“Before then, I didn’t know what drowning was,” said Mr. Valamios, a trim, pensive man. “I realized that if you don’t know how to swim, you sink like a stone.”





After Chancellor Angela Merkel said last year that Germany would welcome refugees, boats started swarming in by the thousands. The Greek government, in the midst of an economic and political crisis, was woefully unprepared. So the village fishermen sprang into action, racing toward waterlogged dinghies as screams echoed over the water.“Our people were in shock — there were so many babies,” Mr. Valamios recalled. “We took the babies first, then returned for the adults. Often you didn’t know if the children would wind up orphans.”He paused, then clenched his jaw. “We saw many people die.”The village soon set up a rescue system. If someone saw a migrant boat in trouble, he or she would alert the fishermen to head out. Residents gathered on shore to meet incoming boats and help survivors, who at one point numbered around 5,000 a day. Women, led by village grandmothers, took the newcomers to a small house, where they dressed them in donated clothes and administered milk to babies.

Yorgos Sofianis was among those stationed on the beach. He is a shepherd, his stable standing atop a hill where he could see the dinghies arriving.
“At first, even my sheep were scared because of all the screams,” he said. “But, like us, they got used to it.”“It was a third-world situation,” he recalled. “The streets were paved with people. On some of the kids, you could see scars from the war back home. Even the biggest hater would change his heart if he saw that.”


            European Refugee and Migrant Crisis        




Amid the chaos, Mr. Sofianis found a measure of salvation. His teenage son and daughter died recently of a rare form of epilepsy, over two successive Christmas Eves.“One night, a kid landed on the beach who looked so much like my dead son,” he said. “I turned away in tears. How much can a person take? At least that boy lived.”He pursed his lips, and gazed sadly at the sea: “That’s what saved me, helping these children. Because I couldn’t help my own.”By last July, more Coast Guard boats patrolled the waters, and nongovernmental organizations swarmed the area to help. Then, international news crews descended on the village, jostling for footage of the human drama.“It turned into a spectacle,” Mr. Sofianis said. “Sometimes they would stop photographing and help the refugees, but many were just here for business.”
At the Mulberry taverna, Lefteris Stylianou, the owner, surveyed his half-empty cafe and spoke bitterly of the aftermath. “They wanted to sell pain, when we gave our all to help,” he said, referring to the news media. “Please, tell people that it’s safe and beautiful here again. We need the tourism.”As summer ebbs, the village is still struggling to return to normal. The healing seems a long time coming.The villagers no longer experience the sea in the same way. When they look at the horizon, some say they think for a split second that another refugee boat is coming.“We have to be ready,” Mr. Valamios said. “If it happens again, everyone will do the exact same thing: We will help.”

In Germany last week, I finally had a chance to meet an Islamic State operative whose identity and membership in the terror group was independently confirmed by investigators and through a propaganda video he filmed in Syria, showing him alongside other German recruits taking part in a staged execution of prisoners.





How I got the interview was partly a fluke: A longtime source whose opinion I value pointed me to the case of Harry Sarfo, and encouraged me to dig into his story. That’s because Mr. Sarfo was not just a run-of-the-mill member of the Islamic State; he was recruited into its grueling special forces training camp, where foot soldiers live in caves and spend hours running, jumping and crawling through the desert, all on less than one glass of water a day. Crucially, because of his German nationality and because he used to live in London, Mr. Sarfo was aggressively courted by a secretive unit inside the organization responsible for dispatching foreigners to carry out attacks in Europe. He repeatedly said no to them, he later recounted. But as they continued to try to entice him, he learned key details about the goals and day-to-day functioning of the covert unit, known as the Emni, from the Arabic word for security.So last month, I flew to northern Germany and took a train to the city of Bremen. There I met the German intelligence agent who had debriefed Mr. Sarfo soon after his arrest in July 2015. The agent, Hazim Fouad, described how Mr. Sarfo spoke nonstop for 90 minutes, as the coffee put out for him in a Styrofoam cup went cold. Later, through a different source, I was able to get the more than 500 pages of his interrogation transcript and saw for myself the enormous detail he provided, down to how the water tank at the special forces training camp had been “painted” in mud to be invisible to drones.Other reporters, including those from the BBC and the Independent, had interviewed Mr. Sarfo remotely, sending questions to his lawyer, who in turn took them to Mr. Sarfo’s cell, where he prepared handwritten responses. One German TV station and one German radio station had gotten in-person interviews, but they focused heavily on what was of interest to a German public: Mr. Sarfo’s radicalization at a local mosque, his interaction with well-known German jihadists in Syria, and the Islamic State’s desire to attack Germany.To me, Mr. Sarfo presented a golden opportunity to understand the terror group’s plan for creating a global portfolio of killers.I met Mr. Sarfo’s jovial attorney, Udo Würtz, in his stately office, decorated with African art. I asked him if I could get into the jail for an extended sit-down interview, and he gave me the number of an official in Germany’s ministry of justice. We reached out, expecting to be stonewalled, as has happened time and again when I have tried to interview Islamic State and Qaeda prisoners in American jails. Our luck was good: We requested the interview just days before Mr. Sarfo ended one year in solitary confinement. He was released into the general prison population on Friday, July 29. To my surprise, the ministry said I could meet with him three days later, on Monday, August 1.
The prison had reserved the room normally used for conjugal visits for our interview. Over the course of three hours, my video colleagues moved the couch, took down the drapes and strung lights from the ceiling to turn it into a studio.I spent that time visiting the jail with its warden, Gerd Koop. When I met Mr. Koop, I understood why this incredible opportunity had fallen into our laps. A plaque outside the maximum-security facility summed up its philosophy: “There is no better way to awaken the good in people than to treat them as if they were already good.”

Although the prison holds convicted murderers, and now a member of the Islamic State’s elite killing squad, I saw no handcuffs or ankle chains. Cell doors are encased in glass rather than bars, because Mr. Koop says studies have shown that cage-like enclosures foster aggression. There are exercise rooms with stationary bikes and pull-up bars on every floor, and a track across the beautiful grounds where you can hear birds singing. With the exception of the 10 prisoners in solitary confinement, inmates are free to come and go. There’s an annual film festival that’s open to the community where inmates sit side-by-side with the general public, wearing civilian clothes.When Mr. Sarfo walked into our makeshift studio, he beamed a smile. He warmly shook our hands. I sat close enough to touch him. Continue reading the main story



Homes in the area were outfitted with bars on the doors and grated metal sheets welded over the windows. Some of the rooms — possibly for the female slaves — were furnished with fans, carpets, pillows and blankets.Nearby, we discovered a burned-out two-story home where the Islamic State had established a torture operation. A heavy chain with a hook at the end hung from the ceiling of a second-floor parlor, and car batteries were arrayed on the floor near the wall, connected to an AC/DC transformer.

Across the street from the prison and torture chamber, in a former school, decomposing bodies were tangled in a hastily dug grave, left to rot in the 120-degree heat.The victims had been blindfolded and appeared to have been killed as the Islamic State fled the city.

DEVANAMPATTINAM, India — The transformation of transgender women into goddesses for an annual Hindu festival takes place in an atmosphere of reverent, somber concentration. Laugh lines vanish, replaced by an impassive mask. Skin becomes stone.As they prepared to perform in the Mayana Kollai festival in a fishing village in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, some of the dancers slipped into trances so deep it appeared they might have fainted. The photographs, taken over the past three years, are by Candace Feit.Indians who decide to live as kothis — also known as hijras, kinnars or aravani, depending on the region — are born male and typically have male lovers.Unlike transgender people in the West, they leave a conservative mainstream culture for an equally conservative subculture. Some live in communes with a strict network of rules under the authority of leaders they refer to as “mothers” and “grandmothers.”Others live with their parents or head heterosexual families. Many reveal their identities as teenagers and are met with years of taunts, beatings and forced sex.But during the festival, which takes place in either February or March each year, these troubles are impossibly distant. Any trace of human expression is lifted, and the kothis begin to resemble the deities they worship. The ordinary is tethered to the divine. — ELLEN BARRY Continue reading the main story



Mr. Wendlandt serves lunch and hands out socks to needy campers every Thursday. But he has stopped provisioning people with blankets and sleeping bags, worried that what seemed like compassion could be exacerbating a problem.

A wildfire in July was a tipping point. Two men from Alabama pitched camp without permission on a privately owned hillside near Nederland, lit a campfire and read their Bibles, they told the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office. The men told officials they put some rocks on the fire to put it out, and though they discussed whether they should do more to smother it, they decided not to.One smoldering cigarette or lightning strike can ignite an entire hillside in the parched, fuel-filled forests across the West, and officials say the campfire galloped away and burned 600 acres of canyons and forests around Nederland. It destroyed eight homes, including that of a fire captain.The two men who started the campfire, Jimmy Suggs and Zackary Kuykendall, were arrested and charged with fourth-degree arson. The day before their arrest on July 10, the two men and a female companion — who was not criminally charged — happened across a reporter for The Boulder Daily Camera who was interviewing evacuees from the still-burning fire.“We were pretty close,” Mr. Suggs told the newspaper. “It looked like the whole mountain range was on fire.”Citing the fire danger, some residents have asked the Forest Service to do what many cities have done in cracking down on the homeless: impose tighter rules on camping, or ban it in parts of the woods that have attracted the most people.
The Forest Service says it is working with thin law enforcement resources. One officer is assigned to Boulder County, which encompasses Nederland and the Roosevelt and Arapaho National Forests, which dominate the western part of the county. The service is spending more and more of its budget fighting wildfires, and has pared back on filling some law enforcement posts, said Chris Boehm, the agency’s acting deputy director for law enforcement and investigations.“There may be some regions where we have one officer assigned to an entire forest or area,” he said. “That’s not what we want, but fires are expensive.”The Nederland fire was one of a handful across the West in recent years that officials have blamed on transient campers. In Anchorage this May, officials said a two-acre brush fire appeared to start in a homeless camp. In Northern Arizona, where a homeless man was sentenced to a year in prison in 2010 for accidentally igniting a 280-acre wildfire, officials stepped up patrols this summer to look for illegal fires set by people living in the woods.

For years, people searching for solitude or without better options have retreated to live in the woods, in buses, vans, tents or other improvised shelters, their numbers swelling every summer and dwindling when the snow comes. But officials say public lands researchers are just beginning to study who lives there, and why.A 2015 survey of 290 law enforcement officers for the Forest Service found that officers in the Rocky Mountain West and Southwest encountered long-term campers most often. About half of the officers said the number of these long-term campers was on the rise, and only 2 percent said it had declined. (The rest said the number had either largely held steady or fluctuated.)Lee Cerveny, one of the researchers who conducted the survey, said it was unclear how many people might be living on public lands at any given time.“What is happening, and why are we seeing more people living in the forests?” she said. “We don’t know yet.”National parks place strict limits on camping, but in national forests and open spaces managed by the Bureau of Land Management, people can pitch tents just about anywhere camping is not prohibited. Many forests allow camping for only two weeks at a time. In 2015, the Forest Service handled 1,014 episodes related to violations of those rules.
Around Nederland, crime reports, medical emergencies, unattended fires and other calls for help and extra patrols have soared at three Forest Service areas popular with homeless campers. The Boulder County Sheriff’s Office was called there 388 times last year, up from 213 in 2013, and officials attribute some of the rise to Colorado’s reputation as a mecca for legal marijuana, and Nederland’s embrace of retail marijuana dispensaries.Rick Dirr, the Nederland fire chief, said his largely volunteer firefighters no longer answer nighttime calls in the woods without a marshal or sheriff’s officer as backup. He said he has faced down one camper who carried a butcher knife, and searched the woods for another man who had attacked his girlfriend. There was the boy who swallowed a heroin baggie, he recalled, and a man who was hit in the head with a shovel.Others just do not understand how the forest works, he said. He responded to a report of an illegal fire to find a teenage boy and his 8-year-old sister alone at their campsite, bags of garbage everywhere. They and their parents had been living out of their car, and the father asked Chief Dirr when someone would come by for garbage pickup.“We still don’t have a solution,” he said. “These are the things going on unseen in the woods.”

So the absence of a friendly Republican is generating a particular despair.“It’s very confusing,” said Eugene Luciw, a Philadelphia lawyer who is active in Ukrainian affairs there. “It’s been difficult to wrap your hands around Mr. Trump.”Mr. Manafort’s abrupt departure does not change that; many Ukrainians want to know why he was hired in the first place. Still, said Andriy Futey, the executive vice president of the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America, who is in Kiev, Ukraine’s capital, for the anniversary celebration and to meet with government leaders, there was “a sigh of relief” there when Mr. Manafort quit.Here in Parma, Cleveland’s center of Ukrainian cultural and religious life, the angst — coupled with what many call a “bittersweet” celebration of a nation whose independence feels threatened — is clear.At St. Vladimir Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral, where a granite monument to “victims of the man-made famine,” which the Ukrainian government recognizes as a genocide, stands in a garden, a small group of parishioners gathered last week as a black-robed pastor served the Moleben, a prayer for the health and well-being of the sick.Gene Boyko, 75, whose grandfather was banished to Siberia by Stalin, was among them; he and his parents escaped during World War II and arrived in New York when he was 10.
“When we got here, even as a 10-year-old, I wanted to kiss the ground,” he said. He has long voted Republican, but is waiting for the debates to make up his mind about Mr. Trump.

At State Meats, a local butcher shop and smokehouse, George Salo, the owner, was preparing to make several thousand pounds of kielbasa — “the world’s best!” he boasted — for the upcoming parade. Mr. Salo, 31, took over the shop when he was 17, after his father died, and learned business by reading books — including some by Mr. Trump, whom he admires as an entrepreneur.But as for the election, “I’m telling everybody I’m voting for Gary Johnson,” he said, referring to the Libertarian nominee.At the takeout restaurant next door, Oksana Zavhorodnyuk, 44, was serving schnitzel and jumbo pirogi from behind a counter. She wrinkled her nose when asked about the presidential race.“I don’t like Trump,” she volunteered, in English that is still halting, though she has been here for 25 years. “He likes Russia; he likes Putin. He’s not in his mind, you know? It’s like, not president for America.”The Trump campaign says it is not concerned. “Mr. Trump has tremendous support in Ohio, and he will continue to share his message of change,” his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, wrote in an email.Ukrainians arrived in America in four distinct waves, beginning in the late 1800s, and many eventually settled in suburbs like Parma. In Ohio, they are part of a broad bloc of voters who trace their ancestry to Eastern and Central European nations including Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Czech Republic and Slovenia, the homeland of Mr. Trump’s wife, Melania.In this swing state, politicians of both parties aggressively court what they call the “ethnic vote.” Last week, Senator Rob Portman, an endangered Ohio Republican (and co-chairman of the Senate Ukraine Caucus), met privately with ethnic leaders here. One big issue: At the Republican National Convention in July in Cleveland, the Trump campaign stripped the party platform of language calling for the United States to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine.

Democrats, seizing on a potential vulnerability for Mr. Trump, are stepping up their own ethnic outreach this year — an effort that has been caught up in Russian political intrigue.
The personal emails of the woman running the outreach effort, Alexandra Chalupa, were among those hacked at the Democratic National Committee, a breach American intelligence officials attribute to Russian spies. Ms. Chalupa, who is of Ukrainian descent, had been researching Mr. Manafort while consulting for the committee when the hack occurred. She has been traveling the country, talking to Democrats about what she has found.“I’d talk about the Russia connection and what we were seeing,” she said in an interview. “People were terrified.”Still, Mrs. Clinton may have an uphill battle. The Podesta Group, a Washington firm co-founded by John D. Podesta, her campaign chairman, has surfaced in the same corruption investigation that has entangled Mr. Manafort.“The unease is about Manafort, the unease is about Podesta — all of them have been getting money funneling in from Russia,” said Michael Koziupa, a Ukrainian-American leader in New Jersey.For Mr. Szmagala, a retired Cleveland transit official who has devoted his life to Ukrainian affairs and Republican politics, the campaign is especially painful. He has fond memories of a flight aboard Air Force Two with George Bush, then the vice president. And after Ukraine declared its independence, Mr. Bush, then the president, sent him there as part of the official delegation for a somber ceremony at Babi Yar, a site of mass killings by the Nazis.Mr. Szmagala has been a delegate to Republican conventions in the past; this year, though national Republicans gathered in his backyard, he stayed away. He has never voted for a Democrat for president, and is mindful of Ohio’s status as a swing state. He is not eager to vote for Mrs. Clinton.“But if it’s close,” he said, “I’ll do it. It’ll hurt, but I’ll do it.”

A spokeswoman for the Justice Department, Dena W. Iverson, said the department was disappointed with the decision and was reviewing its options.In a statement, several civil rights organizations that had submitted a brief opposing the injunction called the ruling unfortunate and premature.“A ruling by a single judge in one circuit cannot and does not undo the years of clear legal precedent nationwide establishing that transgender students have the right to go to school without being singled out for discrimination,” the groups — Lambda Legal; the American Civil Liberties Union and the A.C.L.U. of Texas; the National Center for Lesbian Rights; the Transgender Law Center; and G.L.B.T.Q. Legal Advocates & Defenders — said in their statement.The ultimate impact of the Texas decision is unclear and likely to be limited, legal experts said. For one thing, more senior courts in other regions have agreed with the administration that transgender students and workers are protected by existing laws against sex discrimination, and their decisions will not be altered by the Texas ruling.Also, the decision will not necessarily affect the outcome of other current cases. In the most prominent one, a federal court in North Carolina is weighing almost identical issues in suits brought by civil rights groups and the Department of Justice that seek to block a state law requiring people in government buildings, including public schools, to use bathrooms that correspond to the gender on their birth certificates.Adding another major note of uncertainty, the United States Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a decision by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals that required a school district in Virginia to allow a transgender boy to use the boys’ bathrooms. The Supreme Court issued a temporary injunction until it decides, probably this fall, whether to hear the case.
If the Supreme Court does take the case and reaches a majority decision one way or another, then existing rulings by district and appeals courts could be superseded. If the Supreme Court takes the Virginia case but then is divided, four to four, on the issues, the Fourth Circuit’s existing decision in favor of transgender rights would take effect, although it would not be a nationally binding precedent.The Texas lawsuit, filed by Mr. Paxton on behalf of officials in 13 states, argued that the Obama administration had overstepped its authority in a series of pronouncements in recent years, holding that discrimination against transgender people is a violation of existing laws against sex discrimination, including Title IX in federal education laws and Title VII in federal civil rights laws governing the workplace.In May, in the latest such statement, the federal departments of Justice and Education issued a letter to public schools stating that transgender people should be free to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identities and that schools that refuse could lose federal funds.“A school may not require transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity or to use individual-user facilities when other students are not required to do so,” the letter stated.The letter was quickly condemned by social conservatives, leading numerous state governments and school districts around the country to file lawsuits seeking to prevent the administration from taking action.The Obama administration, seeking to deflect the Texas lawsuit and another brought by 10 other states, argued that the directive was not a regulation or mandate but rather an explanation of how the administration interpreted existing sex-discrimination protections. But it carried a threat that the administration might sue noncompliant school districts and seek to cut off vital federal education aid.The states argued not only that the administration was wrong as a matter of law, but also that it failed to follow legal procedures for issuing what the states called a “new mandate” that “harms school districts from coast to coast by usurping lawful authority” and jeopardizing “billions of dollars in federal funding.”The Justice Department countered that the case was not suitable for litigation because the states had not shown evidence that they faced imminent harm, let alone a likelihood of success on its merits.If and when the administration brings action against school districts, the government and groups supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights argued, the school districts or states could make their case in court.
“There is a multistep procedure before a state might lose federal funding,” said Jon W. Davidson, the legal director of Lambda Legal. “The government would have to specifically challenge a state, the state could respond, the government could bring a lawsuit and then litigation in the courts would decide whether the government’s interpretation of the law is correct or not.”

The debate about race and charters is long simmering. Black residents of cities like New Orleans, which has converted nearly all of its public schools to charters in the decade since Hurricane Katrina, have complained that the people who come in presenting themselves as education reformers tend to be white outsiders. Charter school leaders themselves have begun to acknowledge that they do not have enough blacks in their ranks or in front of their classrooms.But to some black parents, those concerns seem academic.Chris Stewart recalled feeling “like a complete loser” when his son was entering middle school in Minneapolis. A specialty public school had no room; other parents were warning him away from two nearby traditional public schools; and he could not afford a reduced tuition of $12,000 — what he called “the poor people’s discount” — for a private school.

“It really challenged my sense of manhood because I felt like I was watching other people do for their kids what I wanted to do for mine, but I didn’t have the resources,” said Mr. Stewart, who became a school board member in Minneapolis and now writes a blog on education.He found a charter school where black students were thriving and classrooms seemed orderly. “It wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t horrible, it just was better,” he said. “It set my mind at ease and let me go to work every day with a sense that I had done the best that I could.”But Cornell William Brooks, the president of the N.A.A.C.P., noted that not all charter schools are high performers. “This is very much a mixed bag,” he said, noting that he had given a commencement address at North Star Academy, a well-regarded charter in Newark. “This whole notion that charter schools are uniformly excellent, and therefore that people don’t even get to raise the question, is simply not the case.”Studies have shown that charters — which are financed by taxpayers but privately run — have improved on traditional public schools in cities like Newark, Boston and Washington. But they have made little improvement in cities like Detroit and Philadelphia, where a large proportion of students attend charters.
Although charters are supposed to admit students by lottery, some effectively skim the best students from the pool, with enrollment procedures that discourage all but the most motivated parents to apply. Some charters have been known to nudge out their most troubled students.That, the groups supporting a moratorium say, concentrates the poorest students in public schools that are struggling for resources.Charter schools “are allowed to get away with a lot more,” said Hiram Rivera, an author of the Black Lives platform and the executive director of the Philadelphia Student Union.Charters are slightly more likely to suspend students than traditional public schools, according to an analysis of federal data this year. And black students in charter schools are four times as likely to be suspended as their white peers, according to the data analysis, putting them in what Mr. Brooks calls the “preschool to prison pipeline.”Another platform author, Jonathan Stith, the national coordinator for the Alliance for Educational Justice, chose a charter school in Washington for one of his children because it promised an Afrocentric curriculum. But he began to see the school driving out students. It was difficult, he said, for parents to push back against the private boards that run the schools.“Where you see the charters providing an avenue of escape for some, it hasn’t been for the majority,” he said.

Mr. Stith came to think the money would be better spent on fixing the traditional public school system.But Mr. Stewart said a moratorium on charters would effectively make black parents “wards of the state.”
“That’s just stupid,” he said. “Can you imagine us saying that with police forces? ‘They’re good institutions. All we need to do is double down on supporting them.’”Dr. Fuller, who is also a professor of education at Marquette University, argues that the criticism of charters ignores the patterns of racism in the United States and the many ways traditional school districts have perpetuated it.“You look at traditional districts, housing policies, all the things that have created this problem, and a charter school comes into these environments and tries to create a great school,” he said. “For you to criticize based on segregation is beyond the pale. I don’t understand it. I literally don’t understand it.”Charter supporters say the debate reflects class more than race.“It’s a divide between families who are served by charters and see the tangible effects that high-quality charters are having, and some who don’t live in the inner-city communities, where it becomes more of an ideological question versus an urgent life-and-death issue for their kids,” said Shavar Jeffries, the president of Democrats for Education Reform and a former president of the advisory school board in Newark, where his children attend a charter school.“Any advocate for black and brown people in cities knows that for generations, traditional public schools have failed these students,” Mr. Jeffries said. “That’s not even in question.”Supporters of charters also say that the civil rights groups are allied with teachers’ unions that see charters, which generally are not unionized, as a threat to their existence.Mr. Brooks disputed that, saying that the N.A.A.C.P. resolution had been approved by 2,000 delegates and that “we don’t have 2,000 teachers’ union lobbyists among our delegates.”The resolution would not become official until the national board votes on it in October. In the meantime, Mr. Brooks urged less “hyperventilating” and more focus on addressing problems that critics of the charter schools have cited.“If the point of some is for parents and citizens to be grateful and silent, that’s not a particularly democratic response,” he said. “People can be grateful for good schools but also critical in terms of what can be done better.”

So he enlisted several friends to camp out with him at the construction site one evening, rifles in hand, ready to turn away intruders. The vandals never returned, and Mr. Hyler finished building his house, which he lived in for nearly half a century until his death in 2004.While Mr. Hyler was branching out, Ms. Sabir’s grandparents found themselves falling into the familiar cycle of segregation. Migrants from the South, they spent about 10 years trying to buy a house at a time when black families were overtly steered to particular blocks. Eventually, a family member who was a real estate agent worked her connections, and they landed the duplex on the corner of North 17th Street and North Avenue in the mid-1950s. The neighborhood was evolving from one that had been flush with synagogues and restaurants selling matzo ball soup.They were caught in the middle of white flight.The census tract where Ms. Sabir’s grandparents settled was entirely white in 1950 except for the two people that the census listed as black and the six listed as “other.” By 1960, however, 2,344 black people called the area home, accounting for 65 percent of its population.
Within a few years, Milwaukee’s economy would start tanking. Tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs in the city were eliminated. Property values fell, while housing policies made it nearly impossible for black families to obtain loans and move to the suburbs, where many jobs were being relocated.That same pattern of redlining, in which banks choke off lending to minorities and minority communities, has shaped New York, Chicago and other cities, but the impact in Milwaukee proved especially severe, in part because black migrants began arriving in droves just as the economic structure that was supposed to buoy them was disappearing. The shifts ensured that no enclave for affluent black people was ever developed here.Black residents and leaders tried to fight back. In 1962, Vel Phillips, the city’s first black alderwoman, proposed a fair housing ordinance. Her colleagues voted unanimously against it four times in the 1960s.

Activists took to the streets in the summer of 1967 for 200 consecutive days of fair housing protests, and were sometimes greeted with racial slurs, eggs and rocks as they crossed the Menomonee River, via the 16th Street Viaduct, into the white South Side.The Common Council eventually ratified a fair housing law in 1968, weeks after the federal government passed its landmark measure.The racial dividing lines were already drawn, however, and barriers to black upward mobility remained. Even the neighborhood where the baseball slugger Hank Aaron moved in the late 1950s could not avoid a downward spiral. While the black population in the Rufus King area grew from 0.4 percent in 1960 to 89 percent in 1980, its median home value dropped from 9 percent above the city’s median to 23 percent below it, according to “Milwaukee: City of Neighborhoods,” a book by John Gurda.Those historic dynamics of race and housing have not disappeared, either. As recently as 2006, a city government report found that affluent, nonwhite Milwaukeeans were 2.7 times likelier to be denied home loans than white people with similar incomes.Many black people here still view the suburbs as hostile toward them. Just six years ago, the New Berlin mayor’s initial support for an affordable housing project in the nearly 93 percent white suburb was met with threats, including a sign in his yard that read, “nigger lover.”
New Berlin blocked the housing development, and was sued by the federal government, which accused the city of racial bias.Few people around here are surprised, then, that only 11.1 percent of African-Americans in the region live in the suburbs, the lowest rate of black suburbanization among the 50 largest metropolitan areas in the country, according to a soon-to-be released study by Marc V. Levine, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.Milwaukee itself, which is nearly two-thirds nonwhite, has never elected a black mayor. As for Wauwatosa, the suburb that Mr. Hyler changed a generation ago, it is still 90 percent white.Where to Feel at Home?The Sabirs are trying to help their children maneuver through this complicated racial landscape.Taj and Ameera go to a Catholic private school in Milwaukee where most of the students are white, but return to a Muslim household in a neighborhood where most people look like them. Both environments present difficulties.At school, the Sabir children have heard a teacher play down slavery, and classmates stereotype black neighborhoods as bad and drug infested. On their block, where the sidewalks are cracked and some empty lots have been turned into gardens, they occasionally see drugs and fights.They often find their worldviews out of sync with those around them. When Taj was visiting a white classmate in Wauwatosa in May, the friend wanted to go outside to play with Nerf guns. But Taj recalled the police killing another black boy with a toy gun — 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland — and said that he had to be cautious about what he did outside. The police did not always have his best interests at heart, Taj explained, prompting his friend’s mother to respond that the police were good.It’s at times like those when JoAnne and Maanaan Sabir are happy that their children can come home, see the nuance of the black struggle and work to change it — as when Ameera helped petition to prevent a liquor store from opening in the neighborhood. Or when the children volunteer at a food bank down the block.

Still, their parents can’t help but flirt with the possibilities of another life. That’s what they were doing one evening in late June as they cruised through the plush suburbs, partaking in a semiregular ritual of soaking in the Lake Michigan mansions and manicured lawns and wondering about life there. They rolled past children riding their bicycles alone at around 9 p.m., and Ms. Sabir marveled that they could do that.
She thought back to when Taj, 12, had confronted her a few days earlier. He had asked for permission to ride his eight-speed bike around the block. Ms. Sabir could not go out to supervise him, so she said no.“Are you finally going to admit that we live in a dangerous community?” he said.Ms. Sabir pondered the question. She is trained for these moments, with a bachelor’s degree in psychology and a master’s in administrative social work, but she struggled. “We have challenges like every other community has challenges,” she told him, adding, “You’re going to have to figure out the best way to negotiate those challenges.”A Sense of Otherness

Managing sometimes means moving on. And in Milwaukee’s circle of affluent black professionals, that sometimes means decamping for majority white areas in the city or the suburbs.That’s where Latisha Spence-Brookens and X’antony Brookens Sr. found themselves five years ago after their North Milwaukee neighborhood rapidly deteriorated during the housing crash.They rolled into their new bungalow-style rental house in the village of Whitefish Bay, a suburb perched on Lake Michigan with a population so white (90 percent) that it has earned the moniker Whitefolks Bay. And then they looked around in amazement. People were walking. Everywhere.Some strolled past the two-story homes with red, white and blue bunting on the balconies. Others strolled along the main thoroughfare with a Starbucks, a sidewalk cafe, a store selling handblown glass, and a supermarket featuring live lobster, a full-service florist and Champagne caper vinaigrette.The Milwaukee neighborhood they had left behind, which was nearly 93 percent black, wasn’t much for this kind of leisure. After they bought a two-bedroom home in 2008 for $98,000, the effects of the housing market collapse spread through the area. Homes were abandoned. Crime took over.Their son, X’antony Jr., now 18, was walking home one afternoon, toting a plastic Walmart bag with a Barbie he had just bought for his little sister, Zaria, when a man approached him with a large rock in his hand.
“Give me all your money or I’m going to bash your head in with this rock,” the man told him.X’antony Jr. hesitated.“I didn’t know what to do,” he recalled. “This was my first time being robbed.”So he offered $5 to the robber, who took it and let X’antony Jr. keep the Barbie.For X’antony Sr., 48, the last straw came when a neighbor was held up at gunpoint as she came home with her two toddlers. It was too dangerous to stay, he thought.Their home value had plummeted by some 75 percent by then. They had no equity to buy up. So they walked away from the mortgage and rented a house in Whitefish Bay for $1,450 a month, nearly one and a half times what they had been paying for the home they owned.But finally, they thought, Zaria could ride her bicycle freely. X’antony Jr. could enroll in a high-performing school district.

Over the years, the Brookenses genuinely enjoyed their time in Whitefish Bay. Ms. Spence-Brookens, 39, worked as a college administrator and Mr. Brookens as a job counselor for food stamp recipients, and they sometimes would make it a point to get home early from work so they could spend time in the community. But it was hard to shake that feeling of otherness — especially for X’antony Sr.About a week after the family moved there, a police officer pulled him over as he rolled up in his red 1994 Mercedes-Benz to the family’s modest clapboard.He was pulled over, the officer said, because of the plastic cover over his license plate. Back in his old neighborhood, Mr. Brookens said, people often stole license plates, so the cover was for security. Here it was illegal, the officer told him. He let Mr. Brookens off with a warning, but not before asking if he lived around there.
“Yeah, this is my house right here,” Mr. Brookens told him.The stops were a routine occurrence early on — about once a week for a month and a half, Mr. Brookens said. He called it getting registered.“They’re going to keep doing that until they become comfortable with who you are and why you’re here,” said Mr. Brookens, more resigned than angry.He had more disgust, however, when he took Zaria around the block on her bicycle and a mother rushed her white children inside as they approached.Mr. Brookens and his wife also worried about Zaria’s sense of self. She always wanted to straighten her hair. She once bawled when her hair got wet in the bathtub and became frizzy. Zaria’s school friends called her their black friend. Her musical tastes gravitated toward Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift.“I thought she was getting lost,” Mr. Brookens said.That was not necessarily in the front of the Brookenses’ minds when, two years ago, a friend asked them to rent her cream-colored brick home in Milwaukee. It was surrounded by quiet bungalows and curved streets. It was bigger than their Whitefish Bay rental, and the rent was $350 cheaper.They thought of how the savings would allow them to do more of the things they like, such as travel. Although the house was in a neighborhood with a poverty rate 12 times higher and a median home value about one-third of that in their suburban neighborhood, they saw it as a place they could call home.So they returned to Milwaukee, to a different black neighborhood, joining the cluster of families like their own on the city’s north side.

Similar scenarios have developed in other countries, wealthy and poor. After the 2011 earthquake and nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan, some patients at nearby hospitals, including babies, were selected for flights to safety, while others languished for days as medical supplies dwindled. At one hospital, dozens of older patients were apparently abandoned, according to a report in The Lancet, and many died.And during the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, when doctors and nurses could spend only so many minutes inside hot biohazard suits, they struggled with impossible choices over which patients to give care.Dr. Daugherty Biddison, a vice chairwoman in the department of medicine at Johns Hopkins, said she had first encountered scarce medical resources while doing missionary work overseas. She realized that even Johns Hopkins Hospital, a 1,145-bed facility anchoring the $7.7 billion Johns Hopkins Medicine enterprise, would fail to meet demand in a severe pandemic. When asked to help draw up a plan, she said, she felt uncomfortable with health professionals’ making life-or-death judgments without knowing the values of the broader public.

At least 18 states from New York to California, and numerous hospitals, including the 152 medical centers operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs, have already developed protocols. Some efforts, including Maryland’s, have received funding from a federal program supporting hospital preparedness. But relatively few people know about the plans for allocating scarce resources, and fewer still have been consulted.Some of these guidelines are nuanced and flexible to context. But others call for doctors to categorically refuse hospital admittance to older adults and those with certain existing medical conditions, such as kidney failure or advanced cancer, in a severe pandemic.
In Maryland, participants in the forums, designed with the help of Carnegie Mellon University’s program for deliberative democracy, tended to favor saving the most lives or years of life by prioritizing people who were expected to survive their current illness or live the longest after being treated. However, many also said that a lottery or first-come-first-served approach would be appropriate for patients who had roughly equal chances of benefiting.“If you have one ventilator and five people who are good candidates, there’s going to have to be a random sort of chance aspect to it,” said Dr. Eric Toner, a senior associate at the UPMC Center for Health Security and one of the project’s leaders.Unexpected questions emerged in the discussions: Should an undocumented immigrant be eligible to get a ventilator? What about a drug or alcohol abuser, or a prisoner? After being told by a facilitator that discrimination would not be allowed, one participant asked whether using age, one of the principles under discussion, would not also be a form of discrimination.Taking ventilators from patients who did not appear to be improving was “the single most contentious issue,” Dr. Toner said. Maryland’s attorney general released an opinion in December that lifesaving medical technology, including ventilators, could be removed from patients during a catastrophic emergency and reassigned to others who could potentially benefit more from them. Dr. Toner said it would be hard for any system to work without reallocation.But at the forums, many expressed reservations. One woman said that she had been in a coma, on a ventilator, and that her family had been encouraged to turn it off and let her die. “Health care providers are not God,” another said. “I’ve seen it firsthand where they thought one thing and the outcome was different.”

To avoid rationing, a woman proposed a “Susan G. Komen for disaster preparedness,” a reference to the ubiquitous fund-raising movement for a breast cancer cure. Some said they would voluntarily refuse a ventilator to save the lives of other people, such as children or family members. A man questioned whether doctors would even have the time in an emergency to engage in formal rationing. Some with lower incomes said that health care rationing was already occurring based on the ability to pay.Translating all these ideas into recommendations for the state, most likely in mid-2017, will be challenging. The organizers said that despite the complexity, they were now in a better position to provide the guidelines.“We have a much fuller appreciation of what the community wants,” said Howard Gwon, the director of the office of emergency management at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
Charles Blattberg, a professor of political philosophy at the University of Montreal, said he worried that the effort could result in overly precise guidelines.“The kind of judgment that’s required to arrive at a good decision in these situations needs to be extremely sensitive to the context,” he said. “It’s not about just abandoning one lone doctor to their own devices to make it up on the spot, but we can’t go the other extreme in thinking we have the solution to the puzzle already; just follow these instructions. That works for technical problems. These are moral, political problems.”

Ruth Faden, the founder of Johns Hopkins’s Berman Institute of Bioethics, which participated in the project, said she saw value in the exercise far beyond a pandemic.“It’s a novel and important attempt,” she said, “to turn extremely complicated core ethical considerations into something people can make sense of and struggle with in ordinary language.”

WASHINGTON — In 2002, the Supreme Court barred the execution of the intellectually disabled. But it gave states a lot of leeway to decide just who was, in the language of the day, “mentally retarded.”Texas took a creative approach, adopting what one judge there later called “the Lennie standard.” That sounds like a reference to an august precedent, but it is not. The Lennie in question is Lennie Small, the dim, hulking farmhand in John Steinbeck’s “Of Mice and Men.”The Lennie in question is fictional.Still, Judge Cathy Cochran of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals wrote in 2004 that Lennie should be a legal touchstone.“Most Texas citizens might agree that Steinbeck’s Lennie should, by virtue of his lack of reasoning ability and adaptive skills, be exempt” from the death penalty, she wrote. “But, does a consensus of Texas citizens agree that all persons who might legitimately qualify for assistance under the social services definition of mental retardation be exempt from an otherwise constitutional penalty?”Judge Cochran, who later said she had reread “all of Steinbeck” in the 1960s while living above Cannery Row in Monterey, Calif., listed seven factors that could spare someone like Lennie, whose rash killing of a young woman was seemingly accidental.
For instance: “Has the person formulated plans and carried them through or is his conduct impulsive?”And: “Can the person hide facts or lie effectively?”

This fall, in Moore v. Texas, No. 15-797, the United States Supreme Court will consider whether the Court of Criminal Appeals, Texas’ highest court for criminal matters, went astray last year in upholding the death sentence of Bobby J. Moore based in part on outdated medical criteria and in part on the Lennie standard.Mr. Moore killed James McCarble, a 70-year-old grocery clerk, during a robbery in 1980 in Houston.No one disputes that Mr. Moore is at least mentally challenged or, as a psychologist testifying for the prosecution put it at a 2014 hearing, that he most likely “suffers from borderline intellectual functioning.”Mr. Moore reached his teenage years without understanding how to tell time, the days of the week or the relationship between subtraction and addition. His I.Q. has been measured as high as 78 and as low as 57, averaging around 70. On the other hand, the psychologist testified, the young Bobby Moore had shown skill at mowing lawns and playing pool.The state judge who heard this evidence, relying on current medical standards on intellectual disability, concluded that executing Mr. Moore would violate the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment.But the Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the ruling, saying the judge had made a mistake in “employing the definition of intellectual disability presently used.”Under medical standards from 1992, endorsed in Judge Cochran’s 2004 opinion, Mr. Moore was not intellectually disabled, the appeals court said. The court added that the seven factors listed in the 2004 opinion weighed heavily against Mr. Moore. He had, for instance, worn a wig during the robbery and tried to hide his shotgun in two plastic bags, which prosecutors said was evidence of forethought and planning.In dissent, Judge Elsa Alcala said the 1992 medical standards used by the majority were “outdated and erroneous.” As for the seven factors, she wrote that “the Lennie standard does not meet the requirements of the federal Constitution.”
“I would set forth a standard,” Judge Alcala wrote, “that does not include any reference to a fictional character.”In a brief, Ken Paxton, the state’s attorney general, defended the seven factors, though without mentioning Lennie. He also urged the Supreme Court to let judges and juries, rather than medical professionals, decide who should be spared the death penalty.That echoed a 2014 dissent from Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who said it was a bad idea to rely on the shifting views of medical experts to decide who must be spared execution based on intellectual disability. The majority in that case, Hall v. Florida, struck down Florida’s I.Q. score cutoff of 70 as too rigid.In doing so, Justice Alito wrote, the majority had effectively overruled the part of its 2002 Atkins v. Virginia decision that had allowed states to use their own definitions of intellectual disability, and instead imposed “the evolving standards of professional societies, most notably the American Psychiatric Association.”An article last year in the Yale Law Journal presented an intriguing alternative to the evolving standards that bothered Justice Alito. Drawing on historical materials, Michael Clemente, then a law student at Yale and now a law clerk for a federal judge, demonstrated that the original understanding of the Eighth Amendment, based on English common law, barred the execution of people whose mental abilities were below those of an ordinary child of 14.Such a standard, steeped in originalism, a mode of constitutional interpretation embraced by Justice Clarence Thomas and the late Justice Antonin Scalia, would seem to spare both Mr. Moore and Lennie. On the other hand, it is not clear that Lennie himself would have escaped execution under Texas’ Lennie standard. He did, for instance, try to conceal his crime, hiding his victim’s body.In a 1937 interview with The New York Times, John Steinbeck said he had based Lennie on a man who had killed a ranch foreman but was shown leniency. “Lennie was a real person,” Mr. Steinbeck said. “He’s in an insane asylum in California right now.”

Seventy-five years later, Mr. Steinbeck’s son Thomas heard about Texas’ Lennie standard.“The character of Lennie was never intended to be used to diagnose a medical condition like intellectual disability,” Thomas Steinbeck, who died this month, said in a 2012 statement. “I find the whole premise to be insulting, outrageous, ridiculous and profoundly tragic.”“I am certain that if my father, John Steinbeck, were here, he would be deeply angry and ashamed to see his work used in this way,” he said. “And the last thing you ever wanted to do was to make John Steinbeck angry.”

Va. Governor Restores Voting Rights to Felons


After a court ruling, Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia announced that he had restored voting rights to 13,000 former felons, citing his long-held belief in second chances.

                    By WRIC, VIA ASSOCIATED PRESS on                                                                Publish Date August 22, 2016.

Virginia’s governor said on Monday that he had signed papers restoring the voting rights of nearly 13,000 ex-felons, accomplishing on a case-by-case basis what the state’s Supreme Court last month had barred him from doing with a single executive order.Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, cast the move as a civil rights victory in a state whose constitutional ban on voting by ex-felons has disenfranchised roughly one in five African-Americans. In a post on Twitter, the governor said, “We will continue to fight to ensure that our fellow citizens are not marginalized forever.”State Republicans had called Mr. McAuliffe’s effort to restore voting rights a political plot to put more Democrats on the voting rolls. On Monday, Donald J. Trump, campaigning in Fredericksburg, Va., accused Mr. McAuliffe of “getting thousands of violent felons to the voting booth in an effort to cancel out the votes of both law enforcement and crime victims.”“They are letting people vote in your Virginia election that should not be allowed to vote,” Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, said.In fact, however, the governor is empowered by the state’s Constitution to grant ex-felons the right to vote, and earlier studies suggest that most of those whose rights were restored had committed nonviolent crimes.
Almost all states deny felons the right to vote, but many automatically restore voting rights after a violator has completed a prison term, probation, parole or all three. Virginia is one of four states that permanently strip felons of voting rights unless the governor lifts the prohibition, which Virginia governors had done sparingly.Only Kentucky and Florida, which also disenfranchise felons for life, have a higher share of African-Americans whose felony convictions deny them the right to vote.Mr. McAuliffe’s Republican predecessor, Gov. Bob McDonnell, moved to soften the lifetime ban in 2013, ordering that any nonviolent felon who had completed a sentence and paid all fines or restitution be automatically considered for voting-rights restoration.But Mr. McAuliffe caused a sensation in April when he went well beyond that, signing a sweeping executive order reinstating rights for nearly everyone who had completed prison sentences and met the terms of any supervised release: 206,000 ex-felons in all. Those whose crimes were nonviolent — about eight in 10 — were immediately given the right to cast a ballot; violent ex-felons were barred from voting until three years after successfully completing supervised release.“I want you back as a full citizen of the commonwealth,” Mr. McAuliffe said then of the ex-felons. “I want you to have a job, I want you paying taxes, and you can’t be a second-class citizen.”Republicans denounced the move as a transparent effort to help Mr. McAuliffe’s close friend and ally, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, in what was likely to be a swing state in the 2016 presidential election.A 2014 study by political scientists concluded that ex-felons in a handful of states were much more likely to register as Democrats than as Republicans, although the authors said race and poverty, not criminality, were the likely reasons.After Republicans sued to block the executive order, Virginia’s Supreme Court ruled last month that Mr. McAuliffe could restore voting rights only on a case-by-case basis rather than with a blanket order. Monday’s announcement of restored rights for nearly 13,000 residents was the beginning of what the governor’s office has said is an effort to address the voting status of all ex-felons.Officials will address restoration of other ex-felons’ rights in chronological order, starting with those who have been freed from supervision the longest, the governor said.
William Howell, the Republican speaker of the State House and a plaintiff in the lawsuit opposing Mr. McAuliffe’s executive order, said in a written statement that legislators would study the new process for restoring voter rights to ensure that it abides by the Supreme Court’s ruling in July.

“I think the prospect is very good in 2017,” said Gary Banz, a Republican who is majority whip in the Oklahoma House of Representatives. “You can look at any number of states that are not on board yet, and they’re controlled by very conservative elements.’’Including nominally nonpartisan Nebraska, Republicans now control 31 state assemblies — more than double the number in 2010. Of the 11 states advocacy groups have targeted for pro-convention lobbying next year, Republicans control both houses of the Legislature in seven.Representative Banz is among those leading the charge. In addition to his statehouse job, he is the national secretary of the American Legislative Exchange Council, known as ALEC, a nonprofit financed by corporate and private donors, including the Kochs, that is at the center of the convention effort.At ALEC’s annual meeting, in Indianapolis last month, another leading advocacy group, the Balanced Budget Amendment Task Force, staged a seminar for legislators on an amendment convention.Citizens for Self-Governance, a Texas-based group with Tea Party roots, has ALEC backing for a more sweeping goal: an amendment that would “impose fiscal restraints” on the federal government, reduce its authority and limit the terms of federal elected officials.The juggernaut nature of the convention movement has almost overshadowed the longstanding debate about its motivation: to imbue the Constitution with a binding limit on federal spending.
Supporters say the philosophy that state governments and ordinary people usually adhere to — that it is wrong and destructive to spend beyond one’s income — should apply to the federal government as well. In that view, the nation’s $19.4 trillion national debt threatens to destroy Americans’ future prosperity.“It’s immoral for one generation to borrow and spend beyond its means and leave the bill to the next generation,” said Scott Rogers, the director of the Balanced Budget Amendment Task Force.

But opponents say an amendment, not the deficit, is the threat. A government that could not run deficits, they argue, would not be able to stimulate the economy during recessions, when job-creating spending is most needed. And it would not be able to elude budget ceilings for benefits like Social Security, or for job-creating projects like highways that are financed with debt.In truth, they say, debt is a fact of life for both states and ordinary households — in bond issues that finance revenue generators like convention centers and bridges, and for ordinary necessities like cars, kitchen remodelings and homes. Banning deficit spending, they say, would bring the economy to a halt.But the basic argument for federal frugality has broad appeal. Polls generally indicate strong support for a balanced-budget amendment, and advocates persuaded 32 state legislatures to back an amendment convention during the Reagan administration.Congress defused the movement by passing the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, which pledged — toothlessly, it turned out — to eliminate annual federal deficits within six years. Over the next three decades, many legislatures rescinded their convention calls. Only recently has the movement seen a revival.Amendment conventions are not exclusively a conservative cause. With liberals’ backing, four states have passed resolutions advocating a convention to overturn the Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling on campaign finance.Yet debate over an amendment’s merits has taken a back seat to a more fundamental question: whether delegates to a convention could be trusted not to tinker with other parts of the Constitution.
Article 5 places no limits on a convention’s power. Some experts note that the Constitution itself arose from convention called to amend its predecessor, the Articles of Confederation — and tore the document up and started from scratch. That convention even scrapped the Articles’ terms of ratification — unanimous approval by the states — and substituted a lower barrier, three-fourths of states. (Some pro-amendment conservatives argue that the delegates to Philadelphia did not go rogue, but always planned to rewrite the Articles.)So what rules would an amendments convention follow? “The answer to almost every question you could ask is ‘We don’t know,’” said Michael J. Klarman, a constitutional law expert at Harvard whose book on that convention, “The Framers’ Coup: The Making of the United States Constitution,” will be published in October. “I think a convention can do anything they want — re-establish slavery, establish a national church. I just don’t think there’s any limit.”Michael J. Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor and scholar in residence at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, said Article 5’s reticence gives states leeway to improvise.“Once you have a convention, then in some respects it becomes a free-for-all,” he said. “All bets are off.”History suggests at least one Founding Father had similar qualms. During the drafting of the Constitution, James Madison did not oppose the Article 5 clause, , but worried “that difficulties might arise as to the form, the quorum.”Advocates scoff at the hand-wringing. Conventions of states, they say, are nothing new: about three dozen met from the 1700s to 1922, — most before the Constitution was drafted — considering everything from trade to slavery to divvying up the Colorado River’s water. Most did not include every state, but each generally followed a preset agenda. A convention to draft amendments, they say, would be no different.“There’s never been a convention where the delegates went wild,” said Rob Natelson, a former University of Montana constitutional scholar who wrote an amendment convention handbook for ALEC and is now a fellow at the conservative Independence Institute in Denver. “They all negotiated a deal, came to an agreement or didn’t, and went home,” he said.There is, though, one signal difference: none of those dozens of meetings bore the Constitution’s blessing. One, in 1861, did propose an amendment to avert an impending civil war, but it was an ad hoc affair, not an Article 5 meeting.
At least one contrarian liberal agrees with Mr. Natelson. Lawrence Lessig, the Harvard Law School professor and recent, if brief, Democratic presidential candidate, said he doubts an amendments convention would run amok, rewriting the nation’s seminal rules.But even if it did, he said, he would not be especially concerned: After all, a convention only proposes amendments.“The very terms of Article 5 state that proposals aren’t valid unless they’re ratified by three-fourths of the states,” he said. “There’s no controversial idea on the left or the right that won’t have 13 states against it.” Continue reading the main story

Police officers in Pasco, Wash., need more training in de-escalating volatile situations, and the department must recruit more Spanish speakers and women, the Justice Department recommended after its yearlong review of the Police Department, which was prompted by the shooting death of an unarmed man.The death of Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, after three officers shot at him 17 times on Feb. 10, 2015, brought something of a “Ferguson moment” for Hispanics to the town in southeastern Washington, drawing comparisons to the 2014 fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. About 500 people gathered in a Pasco park to protest after cellphone video circulated on the internet appeared to show Mr. Zambrano-Montes, a Mexican-born farmworker, throwing rocks at officers before running across a crowded intersection, where he was shot.

About 55 percent of Pasco’s population of 70,000 identifies as Hispanic or Latino, and the United States census estimates that more than half speak a language other than English at home. Participants in study groups conducted for the review said they wanted to see officers interacting more with children and Spanish speakers. But the Police Department struggles to communicate with them, the Justice Department found. The report said 14 of Pasco’s 76 police officers are Hispanic. Eighteen of the 76 officers speak Spanish.“The department needs to provide more opportunities and incentives to further officers’ Spanish-language capabilities and to attract more Spanish-speaking officers,” the report said.It urged officers to increase cultural awareness and warned that “subconscious feelings, attitudes, and stereotypes” may play a role in their interactions.





“The science of bias has revealed that everyone has biases regardless of the professionalism they display outwardly,” the report said. Countering these biases “is important to fair and constitutional policing efforts.”It also faulted a “severe lack” of female officers — out of 76 officers, one is a woman — calling the department’s gender breakdown “extremely problematic” for the department and the community.”Further, the report said: “Police executives have long recognized that in the aftermath of a critical incident, the community can be your biggest supporter or your biggest critic based on the relationships you have built with residents before the incident occurred. Decades’ worth of credibility and confidence can be lost during one situation that causes the community to lose trust in the department or its leaders.” Continue reading the main story

WASHINGTON — Questions surrounding Hillary Clinton’s email practices flared up again on Monday, with a Federal District Court judge ordering the State Department to provide a timetable for releasing nearly 15,000 new emails uncovered by the F.B.I. investigation of her personal email account and server while she was secretary of state.The judge, James E. Boasberg, pressed the State Department to accelerate its review of those emails, which were on a disc that the F.B.I. turned over to the department in late July. These are emails sent or received by Mrs. Clinton that were not in the original trove of 55,000 pages handed over by her lawyers last year, and released in monthly installments until last February.James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, said the investigators had discovered thousands of additional work-related emails on Mrs. Clinton’s server during their inquiry. While Mr. Comey said he did not believe the emails had been “intentionally deleted,” he characterized Mrs. Clinton’s handling of her email at the State Department as “extremely careless.”

                What We Know About Hillary Clinton’s Private Email Server            

                A private email server used by Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state has been the focus of a half-dozen inquiries and legal proceedings.            



Under any new timetable, the soonest the new emails could be released is October, just before the presidential election. The State Department released the original 30,000 of Mrs. Clinton’s emails over a period of nearly a year, periodically missing court-ordered deadlines as its staff scrutinized the documents for classified information.Two thousand of those emails were upgraded to classified status, while the F.B.I. said 110 emails contained information that was classified at the time that Mrs. Clinton sent or received it.

Separately, House Republicans pressed the F.B.I. to explain why it had redacted information from emails and summaries of its interview with Mrs. Clinton, which it turned over to Congress last week.
Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said in an interview on Sunday that nearly half the documents were redacted — including, he said, “a lot of redactions for things that aren’t warranted.” He also said there were inconsistencies in the two copies of the documents that the F.B.I. submitted to Congress.

Donald J. Trump, tempering the tone of his hard-line approach to tackling immigration reform, said on Monday that he wants to come up with a plan that is “really fair” to address the millions of undocumented immigrants now in the country.The softer comments from Mr. Trump, who is planning a major immigration speech this week, follow months of vows to build a wall along the southern United States border with Mexico and deport immigrants who have entered the country illegally. The strategy was a centerpiece of the platform that helped propel Mr. Trump to winning the Republican presidential nomination.Asked on Fox News if he was flip-flopping on his immigration ideas, Mr. Trump insisted that he still intends to be “strong” while emphasizing the importance of fairness.“We want to come up with a really fair, but firm, answer,” Mr. Trump said. “It has to be firm. But we want to come up with something fair.”Mr. Trump’s different tone could be an attempt to court moderate Republican voters disturbed by the candidate’s tough stances on immigration. His remarks come as recent polls have shown him falling behind Hillary Clinton in several swing states.
The campaign has sent out conflicting signals about whether Mr. Trump would actually change his proposals regarding immigration. Mr. Trump’s new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, signaled over the weekend that the candidate has been rethinking his approach.Pressed in an interview on CNN as to whether a deportation force was still on the table as a law enforcement measure, Ms. Conway danced around the question before demurring.“To be determined,” she said.Over the weekend, Mr. Trump met with his newly formed Hispanic advisory council, and BuzzFeed reported that he expressed interest in finding a “humane and efficient” way to deal with undocumented immigrants that sounded at odds with his previous plan to remove them from the country.During his primary campaign, Mr. Trump assailed all his Republican rivals for being too weak on immigration. He kicked off his campaign saying that Mexico was sending criminals and rapists into the country, vowed that Mexico would pay for his planned border wall, and called for the “mandatory return of all criminal aliens.”On Sunday, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a staunch ally and adviser to Mr. Trump on immigration, said that he was not aware of the Republican nominee changing his policy on border security, but that he is reconsidering how to handle the approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants now living in the United States.“Well, he’s wrestling with how to do that,” Mr. Sessions said on CBS.The new tone from Mr. Trump comes as be continues to struggle mightily in the polls with nonwhite voters. Since reshuffling his campaign leadership last week, Mr. Trump has already expressed “regret” for remarks that he has made during the campaign that might have been hurtful, and he expanded his outreach to black voters. While it may be too late to win over skeptical Hispanic voters, expressing the desire to be more fair could still help Mr. Trump with swing voters.Last November, Mr. Trump was explicit in his desire to deport.“You’re going to have a deportation force, and you’re going to do it humanely,” he told MSNBC.

It had existed as a phrase for some time, but it wasn’t until two black men died in the summer of 2014 that Black Lives Matter began to flicker to life as a Twitter hashtag.The roots of the phrase are commonly traced to a July 2013 Facebook post by Alicia Garza, a California-based activist, but it appeared in the Twitter-friendly form #BlackLivesMatter only in fits and starts over the course of the following year, according to a Pew Research Center analysis on race and social media released this month.The hashtag had a small, but sustained increase in use in the summer of 2014, when Michael Brown and Eric Garner died in encounters with the police, focusing a national discussion on race and policing and elevating a phrase that would define a movement.“This is a very powerful example of how a hashtag now is attached to a movement, and a movement, in some ways, has grown around a hashtag — and a series of really painful and really powerful conversations are taking place in a brand-new space,” said Lee Rainie, director of internet, science and technology research at Pew.The label appears to have lasting power, simmering like a low-grade fever on social media and roaring to life with every police killing of a black citizen and every racial protest that makes the news, informing the long-running national debate.
But it has also spurred fierce opposition under banners like All Lives Matter, White Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter (proffered by the supporters of police officers). On Sunday in Houston, for example, a White Lives Matter rally drew 20 people clutching Confederate flags and white supremacist symbols outside the N.A.A.C.P.’s headquarters to denounce attacks on police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, La.In a report on race and social media issued last week, Mr. Rainie and his colleagues, led by Monica Anderson and Paul Hitlin, retraced the rise of #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter over a period of nearly 1,000 days, from July 12, 2013, to March 31, 2016.The #AllLivesMatter hashtag generally tracked the ups and downs of its counterpart, but at a small fraction of the intensity, as shown in the chart below, based on the Pew data obtained using the social analytics software Crimson Hexagon.


            The rise of #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter        

            Daily tweets citing either hashtag, from July 12, 2013, to March 31, 2016.        


The data show that the deaths of Mr. Garner on July 17, 2014, and Mr. Brown on Aug. 9, 2014, marked an early and small turning point for #BlackLivesMatter, but the hashtag didn’t enter orbit until later that year.On Nov. 25, 2014 — three days after a Cleveland police officer fatally shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice and one day after a grand jury declined to indict the officer who shot Mr. Brown — daily mentions of #BlackLivesMatter spiked drastically to 172,772, according to Pew.


            When #BlackLivesMatter took off

Sometimes, the headline is not enough (or too much).



Mentions of the hashtag soared even higher days later. On Dec. 4, one day after a grand jury declined to indict the police officer whose chokehold led to Mr. Garner’s death, #BlackLivesMatter appeared 189,210 times on Twitter. It was mentioned 160,810 times the following day, too.

Those events coincided with a lasting spike in the mentions of #BlackLivesMatter. In the three months leading up to Nov. 25, 2014, the hashtag averaged fewer than 1,500 daily mentions. In the three months after, it averaged more than 30,000.The hashtag enjoyed subsequent spikes, too. It was mentioned more than 120,000 times on the first anniversary of Mr. Brown’s shooting and more than 127,000 times on Oct. 14, 2015, one day after Senator Bernie Sanders, then a Democratic presidential contender, defended the movement during a campaign debate.
The Pew study cut off at the end of March of this year, but the team behind the report later conducted a supplemental analysis covering two weeks in July when two black men were separately killed by police and eight police officers were killed in a pair of targeted attacks.What they found was a tremendous surge in the mentions of #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter.


            A recent surge in #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter        

            Tweets mentioning either hashtag from July 5 to July 17 of this year.        


On the day that Alton B. Sterling was fatally shot by police in Baton Rouge, La. — July 5 — #BlackLivesMatter was mentioned just under 10,000 times on Twitter. The next day, Philando Castile was fatally shot during a traffic stop in Minnesota and the hashtag spiked to more than 250,000 times. On July 7 — the day that Micah Johnson opened  an attack on Dallas law enforcement officers, killing five — #BlackLivesMatter appeared more than 850,000 times on Twitter.By July 8, the hashtag soared to more than 1.1 million mentions. On that same day, #AllLivesMatter appeared 189,000 times on Twitter — matching the record for #BlackLivesMatter during the entire earlier thousand-day study period.The number of mentions for both hashtags remained high in the days leading up to July 17, when three more officers were fatally shot in Baton Rouge.The July flurry of activity is notable not only for the level of discussion around the hashtag, but also for how the tone of the conversation changed, according to Pew.


            The shifting tone in how #BlackLivesMatter is used        

            How the hashtag was used in Twitter posts before and after the Dallas shooting.        


Over the course of the 1,000-day study period, 38 percent of #BlackLivesMatter mentions were positive, compared with 11 percent negative, according to a Pew sentiment analysis. The hashtag was used neutrally 12 percent of the time. (The remaining references fell into an “other” category.)And in the days leading up to the Dallas shooting, the tone was even more supportive: 87 percent of posts mentioning #BlackLivesMatter did so in a positive light, with just 11 percent of mentions appearing negative from July 5 to July 7.





But that quickly and drastically shifted, with support falling to 28 percent and opposition rising to 39 percent in the 10 days after the Dallas shooting.“We really saw that shift overnight,” Ms. Anderson said. “It really shows you where current events can drive the conversation on social media and also change the tenor of conversation there, as well.” Continue reading the main story



Massachusetts, home of the Kennedys, was the outlier state, cultivating its liberal reputation. In the next few decades, two Massachusetts politicians emerged as Democratic presidential nominees (Michael Dukakis in 1988 and John Kerry in 2004); two emerged as main contenders for the nomination (Ted Kennedy in 1980 and Paul Tsongas in 1992); and one emerged as the Republican nominee (Mitt Romney in 2012), with some Republicans believing he was too liberal or moderate.


            The 1976 Election: Carter Defeats Ford        

            In the popular vote, Jimmy Carter defeated Gerald Ford, 50.1 to 48.0.

1976 This map is not like the others: Democrats once again dominated the South. How did they do it? Some unusual circumstances: Watergate, of course, and Gerald Ford’s pardon of Mr. Nixon. The fact that Jimmy Carter was a Southerner didn’t hurt. Most Southern voters were still registered Democrats. The election was unusual in another way: It was the only one won by Democrats from 1968 to 1992.


            The 1980 Election: Reagan Defeats Carter        

            In the popular vote, Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter, 50.7 to 41.0. John Anderson received 6.6 percent of the vote.

1980 Mr. Carter held his home state, Georgia, but few others. West Virginia was still considered a Democratic bastion and remained so through the 1996 election.This map reasserted the trend, begun in 1964, of Republican gains in the South (fitting, as Mr. Goldwater was viewed as the forefather of Ronald Reagan’s conservative revolution).


            The 1984 Election: Reagan Defeats Mondale        

            In the popular vote, Ronald Reagan defeated Walter Mondale, 58.8 to 40.6.         




The red states reflect a total of 525 electoral votes for Ronald Reagan

1984 Oh, the loneliness of Minnesota, the home of the Democratic nominee Walter Mondale. The state has voted Democratic in every election but one (1972) since 1956, making it the most loyal Democratic state since then. Only the District of Columbia has given the Democrats a longer winning streak. But Minnesota is no longer considered a slam-dunk blue state, the way Vermont, Hawaii and California now are, for example. The Democrats won by only a few percentage points in Minnesota in 2000 and 2004.


            The 1988 Election: Bush Defeats Dukakis        

            In the popular vote, George H.W. Bush defeated Michael Dukakis, 53.4 to 45.6.

1988 Even though this turned out to be an easy victory for Republicans, you can faintly discern an element of the blue-red regional divide that prevailed in later decades. Washington and Oregon turned blue — and have stayed that way. The shift of the West Coast to Democratic control was underway.


            The 1992 Election: Clinton Defeats Bush and Perot        

            Bill Clinton finished with 43 percent of the vote, George H.W. Bush with 37.4 and Ross Perot with 18.9.         




The blue states reflect a total of 370 electoral votes for Bill Clinton

1992 This map is probably the most significant one since the 1960s in terms of partisan realignment. Democrats, in the wilderness since their last White House victory in 1976 with Carter, turned to another Southern governor, Bill Clinton of Arkansas. He ran as a more moderate Democrat, and he and his running mate, Al Gore of Tennessee, proved to have greater appeal among Southern and Appalachian whites.
California joined Washington and Oregon in the blue column, and the Northeast and Upper Midwest mostly solidified as Democratic states.Ross Perot won 18.9 percent of the vote but no Electoral College votes. And contrary to some received wisdom, he did not cost George H.W. Bush the election.


            The 1996 Election: Clinton Defeats Dole        

            In the popular vote, Bill Clinton defeated Bob Dole, 49.2 to 40.7. Ross Perot received 8.4 percent of the vote.         




The blue states reflect a total of 379 electoral votes for Bill Clinton

1996 This map is similar to the 1992 version. It was the last blue turn for Appalachia and for some Southern states along the Mississippi River. Appalachian states are expected to be strengths for Donald Trump this November. As my colleague Nate Cohn wrote in 2014: “Democrats have suffered huge losses in these areas over the last decade and a half. Al Gore’s environmentalism and Clinton-era regulations, along with cultural issues like gun control, combined to cut into the Democratic advantage.”


            The 2000 Election: Bush Defeats Gore        

            In the popular vote, Al Gore defeated George W. Bush, 48.4 to 47.9.        




The red states reflect a total of 271 electoral votes for George W. Bush

The red states reflect a total of 271 electoral votes for George W. Bush





2000 The focus has understandably been on the Florida recount and on Mr. Gore’s fruitless popular vote victory. But he also came very close in New Hampshire — a victory there would have put him over the top in the Electoral College.Mr. Gore also won several very close contests — in Wisconsin, Iowa and Oregon (by less than half a percentage point in each) — and a desperately close one in New Mexico. As The Associated Press wrote in 2000, “Al Gore won a 481-vote squeaker Friday in New Mexico, the closest presidential race in the country outside of Florida, following a series of clerical blunders and a flip-flopped lead that kept the race in limbo for 10 days.”


            The 2004 Election: Bush Defeats Kerry        

            In the popular vote, George W. Bush defeated John Kerry, 50.7 to 48.3.         




The red states reflect a total of 286 electoral votes for George W. Bush

2004 A sea of red, but looks can be deceiving. Had Mr. Kerry won Ohio, he would have become president. He didn’t lose it by much. Had some 60,000 Ohioans switched their votes, he would have won through the Electoral College despite losing the popular vote by more than two percentage points. If Hillary Clinton wins in November, Democrats will have won the popular vote in six of seven elections, this one being the exception.


            The 2008 Election: Obama Defeats McCain        

            In the popular vote, Barack Obama defeated John McCain, 52.9 to 45.7.

2008 The rout was so complete that Barack Obama even won Indiana, one of the most reliably Republican states. In several elections, such as Democratic victories in 1992 and 1996, Indiana remained red despite being surrounded by a sea of blue. Mr. Obama beat John McCain by one percentage point there, then lost Indiana in 2012. Indiana is expected to vote for Mr. Trump this November.


            The 2012 Election: Obama Defeats Romney        

            In the popular vote, Barack Obama defeated Mitt Romney, 51.1 to 47.2.

2012 In his keynote address at the Democratic convention in 2004, Mr. Obama said, “The pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states,” and urged Americans to rally around “the United States.” But this map was further confirmation that red-blue divides had congealed. It was essentially a repeat of the Obama 2008 victory map, minus Indiana and North Carolina.
Democratic victories in Virginia and Colorado for the second straight cycle suggested a shift in those two states, and polling this year has confirmed it, giving Mrs. Clinton many more ways to win the 2016 election than Mr. Trump.PostscriptRace wasn’t the only reason for realignments, of course. Among other issues at play in this era were the Cold War, the Vietnam War, the invasion of Iraq; cultural divides on gun rights, school prayer, abortion; social movements like feminism and gay rights; economic differences on matters like taxes and trade.But race was the major reason the South flipped. Exit polling suggests that no Democratic presidential nominee has won 51 percent of white voters since 1964.

In 2005, Ken Mehlman, the Republican National Committee chairman, apologized for the Southern strategy: “Some Republicans gave up on winning the African-American vote, looking the other way or trying to benefit politically from racial polarization. I am here today as the Republican chairman to tell you we were wrong.”Nevertheless, the current G.O.P. nominee, Mr. Trump, is polling at around 1 to 2 percent among African-Americans.

Donald J. Trump prides himself on his debate performances in the Republican primaries, and he has often boasted about his lack of serious preparation for them.But Mr. Trump began preparing on Sunday for his first general election debate against Hillary Clinton, with a meeting at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., according to a person briefed on the preparations, who was not authorized to speak publicly.Roger Ailes, the former Fox News chairman who helped prepare George Bush to debate Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential race, is advising Mr. Trump as he begins to focus on the debate, scheduled for Sept. 26 at Hofstra University on Long Island.A spokesman for Mr. Trump did not respond to an email seeking comment.Mrs. Clinton is an experienced debater whose first campaign, for the Senate in New York in 2000, was drastically affected by a poor debate performance by her Republican rival, Representative Rick A. Lazio.Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump’s newly appointed campaign manager, is directing his preparation efforts.As of now, Mr. Trump is not using a traditional lectern model to practice. He is instead using briefing binders and reviewing Mrs. Clinton’s past debate performances, the person said.

“She was right, that there were these dark forces at work that were trained on her and her husband,” said Lissa Muscatine, a friend of Mrs. Clinton’s and longtime chief speechwriter. “The extent of it didn’t really add up for people at the time, but maybe now it does.”Yet after more than two decades of attacks from conservatives — some seizing on Mrs. Clinton’s own missteps, her former aides say, but most generally groundless — others worry that an even darker turn is possible, given the advisers now guiding Mr. Trump’s campaign.

In addition to Mr. Bannon, Mr. Trump is also relying on the advice of Roger Ailes, the founder and recently ousted chairman of Fox News, and Roger J. Stone Jr., whose 2015 book, “The Clintons’ War on Women,” accused Mrs. Clinton of being a lesbian, shaming her husband’s sexual accusers and playing a role in the death of Vincent W. Foster Jr., the deputy White House counsel who committed suicide in 1993.“This is beyond anything anyone even thought about in their worst nightmare,” Mickey Kantor, a longtime Clinton family friend who was the United States trade representative and secretary of commerce under Mr. Clinton, said of the new conservative coterie around Mr. Trump.David Brock, an ardent defender of Mrs. Clinton, said, “The conspirators of the ’90s were a ragtag bunch operating in secrecy and as a fringe subset of the conservative movement.”Mr. Brock, a charter member of that “ragtag bunch” before having a political conversion, added, “Today’s equivalent is more a conglomerate than a conspiracy.”
Indeed, Mr. Bannon’s website — which had over 18.3 million unique visitors in July, according to data from comScore — has featured stories about the “radical-feminist code” in Mrs. Clinton’s language; suggested that Khizr Khan, who criticized Mr. Trump at the Democratic National Convention and whose son, an Army captain, was killed in Iraq, should blame Mrs. Clinton for his son’s death; and said Mrs. Clinton’s team was straining to highlight “whatever scraps of humanity can be found in her soulless, ambition-laden heart.”And as Mr. Trump has raised questions about Mrs. Clinton’s health, saying she “lacks the mental and physical stamina” to fight terrorism, Breitbart has amplified those claims. “Bizarre behavior, seizure allegations raise doubts about Hillary Clinton’s health,” read one headline last week. “Clinton crash,” began another, with a video of her briefly stumbling while on stage with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.On Sunday, Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York and a prominent and vocal Trump supporter, joined in, saying on Fox News that voters should “go online and put down ‘Hillary Clinton illness,’ take a look at the videos for yourself.”The theme is familiar to veterans of the Clinton circle.“They’ve always had that ‘Hillary’s dying!’ ” said James Carville, Mr. Clinton’s chief strategist in the 1992 election.Clinton aides said their playbook called for a careful balancing act: ignoring or dismissing Mr. Trump’s most outlandish attacks, while also encouraging independent fact-checkers at mainstream news outlets to debunk any that threaten to gain traction.

Donald Trump’s Conspiracy Theories


From hinting that Justice Antonin Scalia may have been murdered to suggesting that George W. Bush knew the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were coming, Donald J. Trump has shared many outrageous conspiracy theories.

So as insinuations about Mrs. Clinton’s health began to spread from conservative websites like the Drudge Report into Mr. Trump’s own speeches and Twitter messages, her campaign released a statement from Mrs. Clinton’s internist, Dr. Lisa R. Bardack, vouching for her “excellent health” and providing a summary of her medical history.With Mr. Trump replaying the 1990s, her friends and advisers say, Mrs. Clinton cannot help but revert to a war room mentality, making her eager to fight back aggressively at some of the allegations against her.“She can dismiss Fox News or Breitbart, but this is her opponent now,” said Patti Solis Doyle, who worked for Mrs. Clinton from 1991 to 2008. “They’re just going to have to weaponize, contrast with him, respond to attacks.”
Not all attacks are equal.Those close to Mrs. Clinton pointed to the so-called birther questions about President Obama’s birth certificate, led by none other than Mr. Trump: Mr. Obama, they said, may have inadvertently fueled those questions by initially resisting a more forceful public rebuke.“It almost gave it credibility to respond, but at some point you have to,” Paul Begala, a top strategist for Mr. Clinton’s 1992 campaign, said of calls for Mr. Obama’s birth certificate.Theories aside, Mrs. Clinton must tread carefully in blaming Mr. Trump and his allies in the conservative news media for all of her political problems. After all, early questions about Mr. Clinton’s relationship with a White House intern prompted Mrs. Clinton, then first lady, to suggest the existence of a “vast right-wing conspiracy,” in a 1998 interview on the “Today” show.But Mrs. Clinton’s claim was not entirely baseless: Amid a congressional investigation, she and her husband learned of a small team of lawyers who had worked in secret to bolster a sexual misconduct lawsuit by Paula Jones, helping to push the case into the office of the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr. Mr. Starr later expanded his investigation to include the Monica Lewinsky affair.Mrs. Clinton’s aides evidently see an opening to dismiss Mr. Trump, and his more out-there attacks, as simply part of “a well-oiled network of conspiracy peddlers,” as one news release put it last week.Joel Benenson, Mrs. Clinton’s chief strategist and pollster, observed that the most effective political attacks were always rooted in truth and delivered by credible sources.“Do his attacks start losing credibility, particularly the more outrageous ones?” Mr. Benenson asked. “They may have some trouble, considering the source.”

“There is no moving the turnout operation or the absentee ballot program away from Donald Trump and in some senator’s favor,” Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, said in an interview on Sunday with CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “It doesn’t work that way. There’s no hundred million dollars in a drawer that might not be spent on one person, but in favor of another.”In contrast with campaign financing in 2012, there is no outside cavalry of deep-pocketed super PACs preparing to buttress Mr. Trump’s television and field efforts. Two of the largest outside groups backing Mr. Trump began August with less than $4 million combined cash on hand, according to Federal Election Commission filings, half of it from a single donor, the wealthy New York investor Robert Mercer. The primary super PAC backing Mrs. Clinton, Priorities USA Action, reported $38.6 million in the bank and claimed an additional $44 million in committed funds from wealthy donors.The Republican-aligned groups with the deepest pockets, the American Crossroads operation co-founded by the Republican strategist Karl Rove and the constellation of political groups overseen by the billionaire industrialists Charles G. and David H. Koch, have abandoned the presidential race, choosing to focus their efforts down the ballot. Republican strategists overseeing the party’s most competitive Senate races have begun crafting their own independent turnout plans, mindful that their candidates need to reach middle-of-the-road voters Mr. Trump has forsaken.The parties cannot raise unlimited “soft money” contributions — money raised into state rather than federal accounts and parlayed into large-scale political advertising campaigns — as they could during the 1990s, before super PACs became legal.“In 1996, national party committees could raise both federal money and nonfederal money,” said Benjamin L. Ginsberg, a former chief counsel at the Republican National Committee and a longtime Republican election lawyer. He added, “The 1996 R.N.C. raised significant money on its own it could spend as it saw fit.”Some Republicans believe that with the fall campaign weeks away, the party should focus its money and efforts down ballot to protect Republicans’ congressional base. That would mean quietly ignoring Mr. Trump’s call this month for a 50-state field operation and instead emphasizing congressional districts and swing states that are also Senate and House battlegrounds.
“They can’t do anything publicly — you can’t rebuke your nominee,” said Liam P. Donovan, a former aide to the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “But you could allocate resources to places where it helps up and down the ballot.”The difficulty, though, is that as November approaches, the Republican National Committee is more reliant on Mr. Trump for cash than on other recent nominees. Millions of dollars are coming in through a small-donor-focused committee operated jointly with the committee, which is splitting a share of the proceeds with Mr. Trump. Over half the money raised by the Trump campaign and the committee combined in July came from donors giving less than $200, far more than for any recent Republican nominee. (That figure does not include additional small donations raised by a joint fund-raising committee that Mr. Trump’s campaign treasurer controls, which is not required to file disclosures until October.)The campaign’s large-dollar fund-raising, also run jointly with the Republican National Committee, yielded $16 million in cash in July, but much of it is reserved under law for party accounts dedicated to the Republican National Convention, legal expenses and expenditures on offices. Despite being able to collect far more from each of the biggest Republican donors under new campaign finance rules passed in 2014, the committee is well off pace from its July fund-raising in 2012, when Mitt Romney was the party’s nominee.While Mr. Trump has expanded his field operation in August — he announced the opening of 15 regional offices in Ohio, among other moves — his ability to find and turn out low-propensity Republican voters, a crucial group given his campaign strategy, will most likely turn on the Republican National Committee’s operation, set up three years ago to provide a basic grass-roots foundation for the party’s eventual nominee.Mr. Trump also relied on the committee to front $3 million in cash to ramp up his direct mail, money the party recouped in July, according to Federal Election Commission reports.The party is in turn providing much of the fund-raising expertise and technological backbone, including up-to-date donor lists and systems that will send roughly a billion emails by Election Day.

A third of the party’s digital team is now embedded at the San Antonio firm that formerly built websites for Mr. Trump’s properties and is now leading his campaign’s online efforts. Payments to that firm, Giles-Parscale, amounted to $8 million in July, most of which was paid out for online advertising to reach grass-roots supporters and donors, according to party officials.“The R.N.C. has built the most efficient and effective ground game in the party’s history,” said Lindsay Walters, a party spokeswoman. “No other campaign, committee or organization has been doing this for as long as we have. We are the infrastructure for the entire G.O.P. ticket. And the Trump campaign has embraced that.”

Housing is much cheaper. The median home price in the Phoenix metropolitan area is $221,000, according to Zillow. In San Francisco, it is $812,000.For Ms. Rogers and others, that is a far bigger perk than an extra vacation or a raise in California. Instead of renting a rundown house in Redwood City and commuting an hour or more to work, she now lives 10 minutes from the office in a house that is twice the size — with mortgage payments that are half the cost of her California rent.“When I had a kid, it forced the decision for me,” Ms. Rogers said.Hordes of young dreamy entrepreneurs still flock to the Bay Area each year in search of venture capital. Silicon Valley is to tech entrepreneurs what Hollywood is to actors, and the region continues to significantly outpace the nation in creating engineering jobs.But as companies grow and add large numbers of sales and customer service jobs, “it’s less about survival and having everybody in the same room,” said Lawrence Coburn, chief executive of DoubleDutch, a San Francisco maker of software for live events that recently laid off a quarter of its staff to try to become profitable sooner.This year, the company opened a downtown Phoenix office with sales and customer service jobs. “San Francisco is a terrible place for entry-level people,” Mr. Coburn said, because the infrastructure and housing are “failing.”

Local economic development agencies and real estate developers are doing what they can to keep the movement going. Take, for instance, the downtown Phoenix offices of Gainsight, a Redwood City company whose software helps companies track and retain customers. In November, Gainsight opened its 12-person Phoenix office, with modernist touches like exposed ceilings and concrete floors in the hallways, along with the crammed desks and open floor plan favored by tech companies.
The only private spaces are a handful of conference rooms, including one that has a Ping-Pong table and is decorated with posters with famous quotes by luminaries including Mother Teresa.Most of the building’s floors have a more traditional layout full of offices and carpet. But the building’s owner, Ironline Partners, renovated the more open floor with an eye toward software companies, of which there are now three, including Gainsight.“Since those guys moved in, we’ve blown out the entire 15th floor and the entire fifth floor to do more of the same,” said D. J. Fernandes, an architect at Ironline Partners who designed the spaces.The Bay Area has never been especially cheap, and tech companies have a long history of moving their more expensive and labor-intensive functions to second-tier cities where land and labor are less expensive. Intel, the semiconductor giant, was founded in the Silicon Valley in 1968, and by 1979, it had manufacturing facilities outside Portland, Ore., and Phoenix.

But as the latest exodus gathers steam, these outlying cities hope some of the higher-paying engineering jobs will start moving as well.“We don’t want to be San Francisco’s back office — we need more creators here,” said Scott Salkin, a founder and the chief executive of Allbound, which is based in Phoenix, makes sales software and has offices down the hall from Gainsight’s.Chris Camacho, chief executive of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council, says better-paying jobs will follow, since companies prefer to expand in cities where they already have offices. That has been true for Intel, which over the last few decades has added a number of different positions to its original manufacturing hubs.
This is why part of Mr. Camacho’s strategy is to focus on Bay Area start-ups just as they reach a growth spurt. “The reality is all of these companies are going to hit a pain point once they hit more than 50 employees,” he said.But while Phoenix is recruiting companies, its technology scene lacks some crucial elements. Mr. Salkin, from Allbound, said he still flies to the Bay Area once a month for networking or other events. “We’re doing amazing things here,” he said, “but we’ve got a way to go.”Mr. Salkin added that for technology companies, which hire people from all kinds of backgrounds, Arizona’s socially conservative politics can be a form of cultural baggage. For example, the former governor, Jan Brewer, signed one of the nation’s toughest immigration laws in 2010, and same-sex marriage was illegal until a federal court overturned a voter-approved ban in 2014.In San Francisco, “you can come from any walk of life and feel pretty much accepted and safe,” Mr. Salkin said. “You struggle to say that here right now. I think that’s changing, but it has not been the case in Arizona, and I think that’s a big thing.”

At the current rate, Zika is on course to infect more than 90 million people around the world in the first wave of the epidemic, according to a study published last month in the journal Nature. That includes about two million women of childbearing age, and it could result in tens of thousands of babies born with devastating birth defects.The already dire forecast could become even worse if sexual transmission, so far a proven means of contracting the virus, becomes more common and widespread or if the Asian tiger mosquito emerges as a competent carrier. Even the smallest genetic mutation in Zika could alter the ability for the virus to be spread by that mosquito.While it is unclear what course the disease will take, officials say the battle against Zika must be broadly fought to keep the virus at bay. After all, as the country is witnessing in the greater Miami area, a cluster of locally transmitted Zika cases is difficult to stop once it is established.

Daniel Kass, New York City’s deputy commissioner for environmental health, said the city was better positioned than most other places to deal with the threat.Still, the albopictus is in many ways a much more wily and industrious insect than the Culex mosquito, which carries West Nile virus and has been the focus of the city’s control efforts for the past 15 years.“It is very labor intensive,” Mr. Kass said. “Not just for the city but for the public as well.”
The aegypti and albopictus mosquitoes share some traits that make them difficult to kill.They can breed in a space as small as a bottle cap with a dollop of water. They lay their eggs just above the water line, so simply emptying a vessel with standing water will not kill them. Eggs can survive for months, waiting for the necessary rain to hatch.And they are prodigious breeders.Joseph M. Conlon, a retired Navy entomologist who is a technical adviser to the American Mosquito Control Association, gave an example of how fast their population can grow.At the start of the mosquito season, even if there were just a single male and female Aedes in Manhattan in April, and 75 percent of their offspring were killed, that would still leave 800 million by October. If only 30 percent of their offspring died, there would be 50 billion.Albopictus mosquitoes were not even found in North America until the 1980s, when they hitched a ride from Southeast Asia inside used tires shipped to Texas.They are now found in about 30 states and are able to thrive in much cooler climates than aegypti mosquitoes, which has been in the country far longer, having arrived in the United States probably during the early days of the slave trade.While both insects like to feed during the day, there are differences between them. Most critically, the aegypti feeds only on humans and prefers multiple meals of blood, making it a highly efficient virus spreader.The albopictus, on the other hand, feeds on both humans and animals, which in turn lessens the odds that it will be as effective in passing the virus.

But they are both hard to kill, and New York City is investing heavily in its campaign. Of the $21 million that officials have dedicated to combat Zika over the next three years, $11.2 million is being used to improve mosquito control.
The number of trucks used for spraying is increasing to 27 from seven, and the city has doubled the amount of spraying it does both on the ground and from the air.The health department has also trained and licensed about 60 people from other city agencies to exterminate mosquitoes and has expanded the use of backpacks to spray in small, confined locations.New York has deviated from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidance on mosquito control, which has been used in places like Miami. There, each case of Zika contracted overseas has been tracked and then an aggressive control effort is made near the home of the infected person.But in New York, a city of over eight million people with nearly 500 imported cases of Zika — about one-quarter of the national total — health officials have preferred to use enhanced surveillance, demographics and information about known travel patterns of residents to target certain parts of the city as opposed to tracking individuals.To aid in the effort, the number of mosquito traps across the city have also been doubled, with 60 focused on the albopictus. The sites are surveyed weekly and more traps are added to locations with high mosquito populations.This week the city is starting a website — www.nyc.gov/health/mosquito — so the public can track mosquito spraying and other surveillance information.In addition to killing the pests, the city is also looking for any mosquito that could be carrying the Zika virus. The health department has five mosquito trappers and five taxonomists who sort through the catch every day.One of the taxonomists is Feven Asefaha, who estimates that on a busy day she sorts through 1,000 mosquitoes, casting off the males and putting the females in a vial, where they will be crushed and then tested for Zika.
“Time goes fast when you are sorting through mosquitoes,” said Ms. Asefaha, as she sat in front of a microscope and a petri dish holding the latest batch of insects.

In another room in the lab, the mosquitoes are run through machines that look like printers but are actually sophisticated testing equipment. They cost $75,000 each; the city has bought two more and has three on order to keep up with the growing demand.Jennifer Rakeman, the assistant commissioner for the Public Health Laboratory, said the department could handle the workload. “But if we had a measles outbreak or some other emergency, we would max out,” she said.The city is also starting a more robust campaign to make the public aware of its role in the effort against the virus.Still, officials acknowledged the challenges they face.“It is going to be problematic to get rid of those mosquitoes,” Mr. Conlon said.When Mr. Conlon testified before Congress in April, he made it clear that traditional control efforts would not be enough.“We need a national initiative where we make it simply socially unacceptable to have conditions in a backyard that allows mosquitoes to grow, like the antismoking campaign or anti-littering campaign,” he said.The stakes are high.If the aegypti remains the primary transmitter, mosquito-spread viruses will be largely confined to Latin America, the Caribbean and the Gulf States.
Should the albopictus become an effective transmitter, however, most of the United States, parts of Canada, much of western Europe as well as South and East Asia would all be at greater risk.The Pan-American Health Organization recently reported that tests on albopictus mosquitoes in Mexico came back positive for Zika.But perhaps most worrisome is the role the mosquito has played in spreading other similar viruses, especially chikungunya, which causes fever and muscle pain.Dr. Bassett, the city’s health commissioner, said in her speech on Friday she was optimistic that there would be no local outbreaks of Zika, though she added that the city was prepared if one occurred.Still, she said, in a globalized world where new and exotic microbes are only a plane ride away, the city could not let down its guard. “Get ready,” Dr. Bassett said. “We are going to have more of these kind of outbreaks in the future.”

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — A 2014 California voter-approved initiative that reduced penalties for certain drug and property crimes has led to the lowest arrest rate in state history as the police frequently ignore those illegal activities, experts say.The initiative, Proposition 47, lowered criminal sentences by reducing them to misdemeanors from felonies. Conviction on a felony charge can bring long prison sentences, while misdemeanors can bring up to just a year in jail.Recent state Justice Department statistics show the number of felony arrests in California plummeted 28.5 percent last year, while misdemeanor arrests rose about 9 percent over 2014. That resulted in 52,000 fewer arrests over all and the lowest arrest rate since record-keeping began in 1960.“It’s really driven by changes in drug and property arrests,” said Magnus Lofstrom, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California.“I think it’s quite clear that Prop. 47 is the major contributor to the changes we’ve seen.”Last year’s decline in arrests, with the fewest felony arrests since 1969, is part of a long-term decline dating to the 1980s that has been spurred by the law as well as crowded jails and fewer police officers, Mr. Lofstrom said.
It is too soon to say whether or not the changes are helping spur rising crime rates, and Mr. Lofstrom and other researchers are watching the relationship closely.Law enforcement officials said drug offenders may now commonly be cited and released, or ignored because there may be little penalty if they are arrested and convicted. There were about 22,000 fewer drug arrests last year.“The de facto decriminalization of drugs may have an impact,” said Donny Youngblood, the sheriff of Kern County and the president of the California State Sheriffs’ Association. “We do know that there’s a lot less arrests being made, which means there are a lot more people on the streets using drugs.”Multiple courts reported an increase in failures to appear for misdemeanor arraignments since Proposition 47 passed, according to a survey of 40 of the state’s 58 county superior courts carried out by the Judicial Council of California.“If people aren’t showing up in court, if they’re not going to go to drug court, we’re going to see what we’re seeing, which is increased crime rates in our communities,” said Ken Corney, the police chief in the city of Ventura and the president of the California Police Chiefs Association.Justice Department figures show violent crime jumped 10 percent last year over 2014. Property crimes also increased, including a nearly 12 percent increase in shoplifting and nearly 11 percent increase in thefts, two crimes affected by Proposition 47.But participation in drug courts has rebounded as counties adapted to Proposition 47 by including it in sentences for those charged with misdemeanors or drug-related crimes, such as stealing, to support their addictions, said Judge Stephen V. Manley of Santa Clara County.“I think it’s been a fairly dramatic response to getting treatment to the people that need it the most,” said Judge Manley, who is the president of the California Association of Drug Court Professionals.
The initiative has also led to fewer plea bargains, probably because suspects have less incentive to accept plea deals without the threat of a felony conviction or prison time, the Judicial Council found. It reported that prosecutors also seem to be filing more charges for felony drug sales, identity theft and robbery now that drug possession, writing bad checks and check forgery were reduced to misdemeanors.“Some D.A.’s offices have tried to charge their way around Prop. 47, no question about it,” said John Abrahams, a chairman of the California Public Defenders Association’s legislative committee.But Mark Zahner, the chief executive of the California District Attorneys Association, said law enforcement officials may now simply be targeting more serious criminals.Lenore Anderson, an attorney who led the drive to pass Proposition 47, was pleased by reports that there may be an overall improvement in the justice system, even if the initiative is requiring some adjustment.Law enforcement should accept that drug and property crimes still can bring appropriate punishment, while the changes leave more resources for serious felonies, said Ms. Anderson, the president and executive director of Californians for Safety and Justice, a legal reform group.“My highest hope is that we start to really see some innovation that we haven’t seen in the past,” she said.For instance, this year’s state budget includes $15 million for the police to experiment with using case managers and diversion programs to help prostitutes and low-level drug dealers instead of putting them in jail.

He was given little staff or support, but remaining on the C.D.C. payroll gave him independence.“Although outspoken, he understood the absolute importance of diplomacy, and he had the ability to recognize who could go out in the field and get things done with a minimum of supervision,” said Dr. J. Michael Lane, another leader of the fight, now affiliated with Emory University Medical School.

Dr. Henderson spent much of his time visiting smallpox-stricken countries, some of which were also caught up in civil wars. He filed detailed progress reports and threatened to quit when W.H.O. officials asked him to tone them down, Dr. Inglesby said.When the Soviets shipped weak vaccines, Dr. Foege said, “he went to Moscow and confronted them.”The campaign developed a freeze-dried vaccine that could withstand tropical heat and be given either with a compressed air “injection gun” or by putting a drop on a forked needle and jabbing it just beneath the skin.
Dr. Henderson quickly realized that trying to vaccinate vast populations was futile and switched to “ring vaccination.” Dr. Foege, who is considered the father of this tactic, said it was “invented by accident” during a 1967 Nigerian outbreak when he had very little vaccine on hand.“The first night, we asked ourselves what we would do if we were a virus bent on immortality,” he said. They radioed every local missionary asking them to send runners to find out which villages had cases. They sent 80 percent of their vaccine to those villages, using it on the family of each case and all their recent contacts. The last 20 percent went to “anywhere we thought the virus would go next” — which was mostly to market towns where farmers and hunters sold their goods.“It took D. A. about a year to come around to ring vaccination,” Dr. Lane, who worked with Dr. Foege, said. “But once he did, he was an enthusiastic proselytizer.”The campaign, many experts have noted, succeeded just in time. A few years later, the virus that causes AIDS spread across Africa. Because the live smallpox vaccine can grow in an immune-compromised person into a huge, rotting, ultimately fatal lesion, it would have been impossible to deploy it.In 1977, success in hand, Dr. Henderson became dean of the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health.“He was an imposing guy — physically big and very confident,” said Dr. Michael J. Klag, the school’s current dean, who was a student in that era. “He did not suffer fools gladly, and you were never sure if you were a fool or not.”Dr. Henderson shifted the curriculum to send more students into the field. “He felt it was an ivory tower and needed an infusion of practical experience,” Dr. Klag said.He was also in demand as an expert on bioterrorism. In 1998 he was a founding director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies, which was later taken over by the University of Pittsburgh’s medical school. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the mailing of envelopes filled with anthrax, he became the chief adviser on public health preparedness to the secretary of Health and Human Services.
He gloomily foresaw failure for most other disease-elimination campaigns. The “siren song of eradication,” he once wrote, had led to goals that were more “evangelical” than attainable. His doubts passed like thunderclouds across the sunny optimism preached by those raising money for those causes.The problem, he would explain, was that each viral foe was so different. Smallpox had many weaknesses to exploit; it had no animal host. Every case can be found because victims have pox on their faces, and one vaccination provides lifetime immunity.Polio, by contrast, can have dozens of silent carriers before it paralyzes one child. The vaccine must be kept refrigerated, and it takes multiple doses — as many as 10 in some children. And in rare cases the live vaccine mutates into a dangerous form that can itself circulate and paralyze, in effect opening up a second front that requires a new campaign.In 2011, when Bill Gates threw the full weight of his foundation into fighting polio, he struggled to explain how he would overcome such obstacles and, at the end of an interview, turned to an aide and said aloud, “I’ve got to get my D. A. Henderson response down better.”But, for all his self-confidence, Dr. Henderson could change his mind. Unknown to Mr. Gates, he had actually concluded two days earlier that polio could be beaten. He had been persuaded by the campaign’s new leader, Dr. Ciro de Quadros, a Brazilian veteran of smallpox and measles campaigns, that an improved vaccine and better case monitoring could work; he also had faith in Mr. Gates’s commitment and Dr. de Quadros’s abilities.Unfortunately, Dr. de Quadros died unexpectedly of pancreatic cancer in 2014, and the battle against polio goes on.Although Dr. Henderson long argued that the last two stockpiles of smallpox virus, kept in the United States and Russia, should be destroyed, he partly reversed himself in 1998 and said the United States should resume making smallpox vaccine because the threat of a bioterrorism attack loomed. In the prelude to the Iraq war, he endorsed a plan to vaccinate about 500,000 health care workers and emergency responders because of the possibility that Saddam Hussein had weaponized smallpox, a threat that ultimately proved false.“I think he later recognized he had been wrong,” said Dr. Lane, who vigorously opposed the idea. But, he added, as part of the Bush administration, “his hand was more or less forced.”
Besides his daughter, Dr. Henderson is survived by his wife, Nana Irene Bragg, and two sons, David and Douglas.He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, in 2002. Although there was talk of a Nobel Prize, none has ever been given for the eradication of smallpox. Most of the field’s leaders, Dr. Lane said, agreed that no one person should get it.“It was such a team effort,” he said. “We thought it should go to the nameless, faceless health workers who went out and found the cases.”

Imagine if Donald J. Trump hadn’t turned the presidential campaign into an argument over who founded the Islamic State or whether there should be ideological entrance tests for foreign visitors and immigrants. Then he and Hillary Clinton could have a debate over taxes, a serious topic on which they have clear differences.Mr. Trump wants to give Americans huge tax cuts, especially the wealthy, which he claims will stimulate growth. Mrs. Clinton wants to increase taxes on corporations and the rich, and use the revenue to create jobs and help the middle class.Both evade some specifics, but there is enough for a substantive debate.That’s not possible on many issues because the candidates have made it so hard to take their claims seriously. Mr. Trump, for example, has abandoned Republican orthodoxy and said that he would make no cutbacks to entitlements. Could a President Trump continue to buck his party?Mrs. Clinton has abandoned her original support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact. But she’s said so much on both sides of the issue that it’s easy to imagine a flop to that flip.On national security, it’s difficult to delineate any Trump doctrine. He said that he opposed the Iraq war and the Libyan intervention, though he didn’t until they soured.
On taxes, Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, proposes lowering the top rate for individuals to 33 percent from 39.6 percent and setting only two rates below that. The corporate rate would be slashed to 15 percent from 35 percent. And the estate tax, paid by only the wealthiest estates, would be eliminated.Mrs. Clinton would require anyone making more than $1 million to pay at least 30 percent in federal taxes, and would add a 4 percent surcharge on those making over $5 million. She would also limit deductions for upper-income taxpayers and would slightly increase estate taxes for the few who pay them. She would use the added revenue for domestic initiatives, including a $275 billion, five-year infrastructure plan, tax breaks to help with child care and college tuition, and a bigger earned-income tax credit for the working poor.Neither plan pleases deficit hawks like Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.“Both leave something to be desired,” she said. She called Mr. Trump’s tax plan “a huge budget buster,” and independent analysts I spoke to put the cost to the government at around $5 trillion over 10 years.Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate, Ms. MacGuineas said, “uses all the new revenue she raises to pay for new spending initiatives,” and by vowing not to raise taxes for anyone making less than $250,000 “perpetuates the notion that we can solve all our budgetary problems just by taxing the rich.”On the stump, Mr. Trump says he will end the tax loophole that lets some private equity and hedge fund executives pay a lower capital gains rate on earned income. But his plan would allow many of these executives to pay personal taxes at the 15 percent corporate rate, which would do the same thing.Mrs. Clinton has not given specifics on corporate taxes and probably understates the cost of her proposal to eliminate tuition at public colleges. She hasn’t decided on whether to offer a tax cut to the middle class, which might conflict with her commitment to restrain budget deficits.Bloomberg Politics calculates that the Clintons would have paid about $1.7 million less tax last year under the Trump plan and at least $224,000 more under hers.Mr. Trump, who refuses to release his tax returns, would also probably pay more under Mrs. Clinton’s proposal and less under his. His heirs would surely pay less.
This is all stuff that would make for a better debate this autumn than what we are seeing and are likely to see for the next 11 weeks. Continue reading the main story


This support comes within the framework of strategic co-operation and co-ordination between the two countriesABU DHABI: The UAE has offered a financial deposit worth $1 billion to the Arab Republic of Egypt at the Central Bank of Egypt for a period of six years.The deal was signed by Mohammad Saif Al Suwaidi, Director-General of the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) and Tarek Amer, Governor of the Central Bank of Egypt, in the presence of Juma Mubarak Al Junaibi, UAE Ambassador-designate to the Arab Republic of Egypt and the UAE’s Permanent Representative to the Arab League; Rashid Al Kaabi, Director of Investment Management at the ADFD; Fatima Khamis Al Mazrouei, Ambassador and Extraordinary Plenipotentiary at the UAE Embassy to Egypt, and Deputies of Governor of the Central Bank of Egypt.This support comes within the framework of strategic co-operation and co-ordination between the two countries, and out of the UAE’s unwavering stand in support of Egypt and its people to promote the development process, as well as the recognition of Egypt’s central role in the region.
Dubai: Shaikha Hind Bint Maktoum Bin Juma Al Maktoum, wife of His Highness Shaikh Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, stressed the indispensable role of women as an active driving force in the nation’s sustainable development.“As the UAE is marking the second Emirati Women’s Day on August 28, I would like to highlight three main pillars demonstrating the authenticity and value of Emirati women as strategic partners of their male counterparts in achieving sustainable development. First, women in our beloved country have delivered remarkable successes thanks to God and the encouragement by the loyal leadership and support of Her Highness Shaikha Fatima Bint Mubarak, Chairwoman of the UAE General Women’s Union, Supreme Chairwoman of the Family Development Foundation and Chairperson of the Supreme Council for Motherhood and Childhood, for women’s issues and aspirations. Second, Emirati woman have proved their merit in professional, political, health, security, social, economic and educational spheres and other fields with strength and excellence. Third, UAE woman are willing and certainly ready to offer sacrifices and show loyalty in the service of the nation out of their loyalty to the leadership and the homeland,” Shaikha Hind said.In a statement ahead of the event, Shaikha Hind extended warm congratulations to Shaikha Fatima (Mother of the Nation) on the observation of the second Emirati Women’s Day under the theme ‘Women and Innovation’.Shaikha Hind said, “UAE women have become a key partner in leading the sustainable development and are now assuming senior leadership roles in the sovereign, executive and legislative authorities, including the presidency of the Federal National Council. The UAE women boast of having the highest representation in ministerial portfolios in the Arab region.”Thanks to their qualifications and leadership skills, she noted, UAE women have taken up jobs in the judiciary, public prosecution as well as other sectors that require highly educated and trained professionals such as renewable energy, space, engineering, civil and military aviation, air defence, and ministry of interior, to name a few.“They are gold chapters in the wall of humanity that shows the highest, exceptional standing UAE women have reached thanks to God and the wise and loyal leadership of President His Highness Shaikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Shaikh Mohammad and His Highness Shaikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces,” she added.She noted that this year’s theme of the celebrations fits well with the government’s strategy to promote the values of quality, innovation, creativity and excellence.August 28 was declared Emirati Women’s Day. The date marks the creation of the General Women’s Union in 1975, and is considered a chance to celebrate Emirati women’s achievements since the union was founded.

Dubai: All halal food products sold in Dubai will soon have to carry a smart logo that will help consumers verify the authenticity of their halal accreditation using a mobile application.Dubai Municipality on Monday signed an agreement with SICPA, a Swiss company that will provide the smart logo to companies producing halal food products and a mobile app for consumers to verify the halal certification of these products.Hussain Nasser Lootah, director-general of Dubai Municipality, said the smart logo will be implemented in the market within six months.SICPA will launch the mobile app for the consumers and the inspection device for inspectors after the implementation of the smart logo in the market.Ameenah Ahmad Mohammad, director of Dubai Accreditation Centre under the municipality, said the plan is to digitise the UAE National Halal Mark so that the information encoded in the logo can be read by using the mobile app.“Now, even if the halal mark is there, you can’t be sure if the product was really certified. Sometimes, some companies can cheat. They can put the label without getting accreditation… Using the app, consumers can scan the smart logo and retrieve all information related to the product such as the country of origin of the product and the authenticity of the halal certification it has received.”She said all companies producing halal food products will have to now apply for the smart logo of the UAE National Halal Mark that can be digitally read.“Only this company [SICPA] can provide it. In the future, if the logo can’t be digitally read, it will not be considered original accreditation,” said Mohammad.According to the official, authorities in the UAE are trying to have only one logo [the UAE National Halal Mark] for all halal products in the country. “If there are products with accreditation from anywhere else, they should also get this logo,” said Mohammad.By scanning the smart logo, food inspectors will be able to trace the history of the product without referring to paperwork.
System will let consumers and inspectors in Dubai verify expiry, refilling detailsDubai: How many times can your five-gallon water bottles be refilled? Only 33 times, according to Dubai Municipality.But how do you know your water supplier has complied with this rule? A new smart labelling and tracking system will soon help consumers and inspectors in Dubai check the safety of the five-gallon water bottles and make sure they do not cross the limit for refilling.The Dubai Municipality on Monday signed an agreement with SICPA, a Swiss company that will provide smart solutions, including mobile applications through which consumers and inspectors can verify details of these water bottles.“Through this solution we will be able to trace bottled water and monitor the safety of both the container and the contents by means of smart labelling and laser engraving,” Hussain Nasser Lootah, director-general of Dubai Municipality, said after signing the agreement with Philippe Amon, chairman and CEO of SICPA, on Monday.“This method will enable us to know how many times the bottle has been used as well as analyse different testing parameters for the water… We are hopeful that this system will be a turning point in our local and national smart food inspection and monitoring efforts,” he said.The smart track and trace technology called SICPATRACE will empower consumers to scan the bottles themselves to confirm their origin, other product information and detect uncertified products. Once the app is launched, customers will be able to read product details, company name, brand name and when the bottle was filled the last time.Inspectors will be able to read additional information such as number of refills, expiry date, pH value, and other technical parameters for the water and the bottle.Khalid Mohammad Sherif Al Awadhi, director of the Food Safety Department at the municipality, said the new smart labels will be made mandatory for 36 companies producing five-gallon water bottles in Dubai. In the next phase, it will be expanded to other bottled water companies that sell their products in Dubai.According to Al Awadhi, water companies will be allowed to refill a five-gallon bottle only 33 times.Studies have found that these bottles can be safely refilled 35 times due to the climatic conditions here. Officials have decided to limit it to 33 times to ensure better safety of the drinking water. Reusing the polycarbonate plastic bottles above the permitted limit can harm people as it releases carcinogenic and endocrine disruptive compounds in water.Essam Sharaf, head of Food Studies and Systems Section, said the department will introduce the smart label in April and will give a grace period for the companies to implement it. The mobile app for customers will be launched after the implementation of the system. Inspectors will be provided with a special device to read additional information about the product.Ameenah Ahmad Mohammad, director of Dubai Accreditation Centre under the municipality, said Dubai will be the first place, along with Turkey, to introduce this smart technology.“First thing you can be sure is that the water is from the original company. There have been cases when some companies refill the bottles of others and sell them. With this system, you can make sure that it came from the factory of the original company. By checking the date of refilling you can find out if water has crossed its shelf life of six months,” said Mohammad.“The laser engraving in the smart labels rejects water bottles that have crossed the permitted number of refills during the water filling procedure in the production line. If they manually fill it and send it to the market, inspectors can verify it by reading the smart label and reject it and fine the violators,” she explained.A SICPA representative said the app, which will be launched after the implementation of the smart labelling system in the market, will enable consumers to verify if the product is recalled and also to report any potential malpractice in smart labelling system to Dubai Municipality.
If you love intense theme park rides, you’re in for a treat at Dubai’s latest attraction, opening August 31There are plenty of nice things to say about IMG Worlds of Adventure, the theme park opening its doors in Dubai on August 31, but those of you who enjoy theme parks aren’t really looking for nice, are you?You’re looking for thrills, fear and the kind of head-spinning, stomach-churning feelings of sensory overload that only a gallon of fizzy soda will ease.Finally, Dubai has a park that can deliver that.I strapped myself in for a media preview of the indoor theme park on Monday, emerging a few hours later slightly wobbly but impressed by the quality of the rides. The park has four zones — IMG Boulevard, Marvel, Lost Valley and Cartoon Network, and if you can believe it, the first ride that had my head spinning is to be found inside Cartoon Network land.The Powerpuff Girls — Mojo’s Robot Rampage! may look pretty cute, with its little pink pods waiting for you to board.Do not be fooled.This ride is no joke. Within seconds of it starting, you’re slowly rotating upside down, around and around. I have newfound respect for Buttercup, Bubbles and Blossom, the deceptively adorable superheroes of the Cartoon Network show, if this is what it takes to be a superhero. (My experiences were stripped of music and light, the park operator told us, in order for us to be able to film the ride in action without too much ambient noise, so it was at times a surreal and silent experience.)The ceiling of the park is covered in sound-proofing black arches that will muffle the noise created by all the rides and the screaming guests as they fly through the air; I can imagine with all the rides operating at full tilt, it would otherwise be extremely noisy.The level of ride insanity cranks up in Lost Valley, where two roller coasters await — on Monday, only Predator was available to test out (all rides and attractions, including the outdoor roller coaster Velociraptor, will be functioning on opening day, the park’s CEO Leonard Otto assured me). Predator is for those with a love of heights, speed and falling off a track at a beyond-vertical angle. Set in the middle of the park, this is a great, if brief (30-second) ride that will have the incredulous and fearful watching from the nearby pretzel station as a car climbs a high vertical track and tips over the edge, carrying its screaming load straight down into loops and turns. It’s really good — if over very quickly.Theme park technology is moving beyond simply throwing patrons down roller coaster tracks, however; “dark” rides are becoming a must-have. In these indoor attractions, riders board a coaster that still throws the traditional loops and bends, to sickening effect, but you never know what’s coming. Multimedia displays often accompany the ride, giving the feeling of flying through scenarios. At IMG Worlds of Adventure, that’s the Battle of Ultron ride, which again I was not able to test out. (I also watched the Thor Thunder Spin, deemed the park’s most head-spinning ride, in which a gondola of riders is repeatedly flipped back-and-forth, up-and-down.) In the Marvel world, I was able to sample, instead, Spider-Man Doc Ock’s Revenge, a “spinning” coaster in which the ride’s cars rotate independently as you thunder around the track. It’s brilliant, and even drew applause from the hard-bitten journos riding it.IMG Boulevard is mostly dedicated to shopping and eating (although there’s no lack of that elsewhere in the park, with many rides spilling their woozy patrons straight out into gift shops). Also in the Boulevard area is the Haunted Hotel, and however cheesy and un-scary it initially appears, there are plenty of frights and all-out grossness here. I won’t ruin it by describing the scenes that await as you walk through, but there is one room that wouldn’t be out of place in some of the worst (by that I mean best) horror films made. It’s all brought to life by an amazing cast of actors, and some choice smells.Let’s say you’re only 10 years old, and have the soul of a theme-park junkie, if not the minimum height. What can you do? You’ll probably enjoy the Ben 10 5D Hero Time and Gumball rides; the first is an immersive cinema experience into the world of the boy hero; the second is a point-scoring laser-shooting game that’s mild fun for the younger set. The child in me would have loved to clamber all over the Lost Valley’s Adventure Fortress, a series of climbing platforms and slides set amongst the park’s dozens of animatronic dinosaurs, and the Avengers Flight of The Quinjets, a more sedate flying ride that will suit families. The really dinky types should head for Lazy Town and the accompanying CN Live stage show — it’s loud, colourful and full of dancing and singing.Though it’s 1.5 million square feet in size, the circular format means the park isn’t exhaustingly large, and there are plenty of places to stop and rest, and be encouraged to shop for food and merchandise. My tip? Take a sweater: The indoor park is chilly, and there are lockers all over where you can leave your belongings when needed (this is especially important as mobile phones and cameras are not permitted on any of the rides).  
Sharjah: In the lead up to Eid Al Adha next month, police on Monday said they had arrested 9,663 illegals and beggars, including an Arab man who had Dh1 million hidden in his flat.The suspects were arrested in 440 raids in the first eight months of this year, netting 6,850 men and 2,813 women, said the police.Records reveal an Arab man in his 50s posing as a beggar in Al Taawun area had amassed an enormous pile of cash of more than Dh1 million from street begging. He was visiting UAE constantly and has been referred to the authorities for investigation. The money was confiscated.Police also unearthed an illegal network of 20 illegal Asian residents working in a car wash next to a shopping centre in Sharjah and earning more than Dh1.2 million a month together in illegal activities, the investigators found.Lt Col Saleem Harimal, Head of Violations Section at Sharjah Police, said a large number of those arrested were found hiding in abandoned buildings, building sites, workshops and empty labour accommodations.He said the new Eid Al Adha campaign by police comes as part of a plan to curb an expected surge on Sharjah streets of con artists this coming holiday.Lt Col Harimal stressed inspections would continue round the clock to prevent street thugs fleecing law-abiding residents.First Lieutenant Mohammad Nasser Al Awadi, an officer at the Violations Section at the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs, thanked the Sharjah Police commander-in-chief, Brigadier Saif Ziri Al Shamisi, who directed him to educate community members regarding dangerous beggars through a new campaign in partnership with the Ministry of Interior.Major Ebrahim Al Meer, deputy director of Media and Public Relation Department of Sharjah Police, said the police are also working in cooperation with the Islamic Affairs Department through numerous anti-begging campaigns (in the emirate of Sharjah, including the Central and Eastern Regions) which handed out booklets, sent SMSs and warnings via social media channels.Maj Al Meer advised people to immediately report cases of begging, saying that beggars not only harass people and distort the country’s image but many of them are also involved in other illegal activities.Beggars use various methods to extract money from people, including pretending they do not have money to pay for food or knocking on doors posing as neighbours. They make up a story that they have been locked out of their house and need money for fuel.“Some beggars pretend they are disabled, have a life-threatening disease, are unable to provide for their families or need money for urgent surgery,” a police official said.In other cases, beggars provide fake documents about a fund-raising campaign to build a mosque or a school for orphans in their home country.Based on studies of past cases, the police found that organised gangs bring beggars into the country.“We have realised that groups and individual beggars were issued visas. Our focus is not only on combating street begging but those who assist these individuals. Street begging occurs everywhere and in Sharjah we take the matter seriously as it ruins the reputation of the country and it affects security. The presence of beggars in mosques and shopping malls or any other public area is not a pleasant image for the country,” the official said.“We have arrested many beggars who were not only disturbing the public with their illegal activities but were involved in robberies, crime and prostitution. Police urge the public not to fall for the many scams created by these individuals and to contact the police when they find a beggar.”The official added that beggars are dangerous and can injure people and steal from them in residential areas. They stand the whole day in front of residential buildings, watching and gathering information about the people who live there. Police cameras monitor beggars without their knowledge which police use to show people how beggars operate.Police investigations have caught some people who spend their day begging and at night they either sleep in a luxury hotel, using the money gained from begging, rent a luxury car or buy expensive clothes. Police have found many beggars t in possession of millions of dirhams, and some enter the country on a visa solely for the purpose of begging....

Top universities in the country opening doors for new academic year starting from this weekAbu Dhabi: Distinguished and top performing students from Eritrea were welcomed to Zayed University on Sunday to begin their new scholarship programmes, as several top universities begin opening their doors at the start of the new academic year. The 20 students consisting of 16 men and four women were chosen as part of the university’s initiative of accepting distinguished international students and providing them higher education. “Zayed University offers a wide range of options and challenges and I encourage all of you to optimise and maximise your potential to make your experience at the university as personally enlightening as it is academically rewarding,” said Dr Marilyn Roberts, Acting Provost at Zayed University, while welcoming the new students.Dr Fatima Al Darmaki, Assistant Provost for Student Affairs, also welcomed the new students and encouraged the students to feel at home and to visit the university’s newly established council centre if they have any problems adapting to their new surroundings. “The centre can help students to overcome problems such as stress, time management, depression and anxiety. I am always happy to meet your requests and assist you with all matters related to your academic progress and personal development,” she said. For its new academic year, Zayed University has received 2,098 students and 61 international students. Paris-Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi, which begins its classes next week, announced that it was receiving 250 new students this year, as it prepares for its 10th year. The university has become one of the most sought after universities in the region and internationally, with thousands of prospective applications sent. “We are keen in Sorbonne Abu Dhabi to select excellent students to join our big family, which includes more than 75 nationalities. We are looking forward to the start of this new academic year as we celebrate the completion of the tenth anniversary from the establishment of our university in Abu Dhabi,” said Dr Fatima Saeed Al Shamsi, Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Administrative Affairs at Paris Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi. “The new academic year will feature a number of innovative activities and events that will be a great addition to Sorbonne Abu Dhabi. Based on our belief that students are the epitome of a promising future, we shall pursue our efforts to equip them with all the needed tools to offer them a successful and a complete student experience at all levels,” she added.Top ranking UAE universitiesAmong the universities starting classes either this week or next, the majority of them are rated among the top 100 universities in the Arab world by QS University Rankings, a professional organisation that ranks universities from around the world. This includes Zayed University, Paris Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi, UAE University, Abu Dhabi University, and Khalifa University, among many others.
First networking meeting is in celebration of the 49th founding anniversary of Asean this monthFrom left: Cheong Ming, Yubazlan Yusof, Unnop Buranasate, Paul Raymund Cortes and Arzaf Firman.Dubai: The heads of missions of five Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries based in Dubai met in a networking event for the first time with leaders of their communities on Monday to discuss future areas of collaboration and cooperation from the Middle East to their home countries.Asean was established in August 1967 in Bangkok, Thailand, by five countries, namely, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Five more countries joined later — Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam.The association was formed to accelerate the region’s economic growth, social progress and cultural development through joint endeavours as well as to promote regional peace and stability.The meeting at the Philippine Consul-General’s official residence on Monday was held in celebration of the 49th founding anniversary of Asean. It was also held in lieu of the 28th and 29th Asean Summit from September 6 to 8 that will be attended by the heads of state of its 10 member countries.Consuls-general from five member countries that have consulates in Dubai, namely, Arzaf Firman, from Indonesia; Yubazlan Yousuf, Malaysia; Paul Raymund Cortes, Philippines; Cheong Ming Foong, Singapore; and Unnop Buranasate, Thailand, attended the meeting on Monday.“The key is once we get all the Asean nationals network with each other very closely, then we can open up doors for future possible cooperation. This is just the beginning of a more collaborative and coordinated action among the five Asean communities,” Cortes said.Malaysian Consul-General Yousuf said the meeting was significant to provide opportunities for the Asean people to have a role in participatory governance and citizen engagement.“As a community, you need really to have a very good people-to-people interaction. What’s more important is this is our first public diplomacy programme by all the Asean consuls here. Everyone wants to be part of the decision-making process, that’s what we are doing now,” Yousuf said.The meeting was also an avenue for cultural promotion and understanding for better connectivity, Consul-General Buranasate of Thailand said.Cortes said fostering cooperation is not to be limited to the Asean countries but also with other unions like the GCC.“There has been quite a number of Asean-GCC meetings. Of course moving forward, we’d like to see more cooperation in terms of economic exchanges of people. Clearly we already have an exchange of people for Filipinos already, but we’d like other Asean nationals to be part of this as well,” Cortes said.

Suspect caught removing cash on airport CCTV camerasDubai: A 24-year-old Yemeni policeman was charged with stealing Dh3,500 from a wallet left behind by an Indian passenger at an X-ray machine at Dubai International Airport.The suspect confessed to the crime to prosecutors. The man was caught, after his colleague, a lieutenant, saw two wallets left behind by the Indian passenger and handed them over to the lost and found section.An hour later, the Indian passenger returned to collect his wallets. He checked the wallets and found Dh3,500 missing.The officer asked the victim if he wanted to report the incident, but he said he was in a hurry to catch his flight and would report the incident when he returned.However, the officer reported the incident to the operations room and was asked to review the CCTV footage. The footage showed the suspect stealing from the wallet and putting the money in his pocket.The officer the confronted the suspect who confessed to the crime and handed over the money immediately.
Dubai: A man was charged with kidnapping, raping and stealing from a Moroccan woman after posing as a police officer, a court heard on Monday.The victim told the Dubai Public Prosecution that the 31-year-old Pakistani suspect, who was in a four-wheel drive vehicle, stopped her after she left a restaurant in Al Riqqa area around 8pm in April.“He said he was investigating a jewellery shop robbery by a group of women in this area. I told him I did not know anything about the incident, and he told me he would show me some photos from the robbery. He showed me some photos on his pone of women’s hands that he said were from the robbery while I was still standing outside his car,” she told the prosecution.She said the man then asked her if he could take a photo of her hand, which he claimed was to make sure it did not match the photos taken from the robbery case. The man then asked her to get into the car so he could take a photo, court papers stated.He locked the car and held her arm when she tried to leave. The suspect drove to a residential area where he forced her to move to the back seat and raped her.She said she screamed and attempted to run away but he grabbed her and covered her mouth with his hand. “When he was done, he made me sit in the front seat, then drove to the main road where he stopped a taxi and asked me to take it to wherever I want,” she said.She also alleged that the man took her bag and stole her two mobile phones worth around Dh4,000, and Dh500 in cash.When the man was arrested, police found the two stolen phones and the victim identified him from a line up three times.
Tuition fee increases and cost of transport, uniforms, school bags, shoes and stationery weigh on household budgetsParents and children shop for school accessories at Lulu Hypermarket in Khalidiya Mall, Abu Dhabi, ahead of the re-opening of schools after the summer vacation.Dubai/Abu Dhabi: Many parents are struggling as usual to pay the first instalment of fees for the new school year, which begins next week, because of tuition fee hikes, unplanned expenses, and back-to-school shopping.The first instalment, usually paid by cash or current-dated cheque at the end of August or the beginning of September, is typically the biggest single expense in the school year.Parents of students studying in Indian curriculum schools, which start their first term in April pay their second term fees in September.Parents said besides tuition fees, charges for new uniforms, books, and school transport are usually built into the first instalment. Adding to the financial burden are school bags, shoes, stationery and other items bought for the new school year.Many parents are already squeezed for cash after returning from their annual leave or face rent payments around the same time as the first school instalment.Parents and students shopping school accessories at Khalidiya Lulu hypermarket ahead of school re-opening after summer vaccation in Abu Dhabi. Courtesy: Ahmed Kutty/Gulf NewsParents interviewed by Gulf News said they try to plan and balance their expenses in order to meet the first instalment — sometimes by up to half a year in advance — but they often encounter surprises that blow a hole in their budget.Dubai-based Algerian expat Ameenah Soussi had to budget extra for Dh4,500 this year after her two sons’ school asked for the amount for two tablets, as part of the school’s focus on “e-education”.“This was outside our school budget, which we normally start saving for in March every year. The school obliged it, so as parents we go with for our children’s sake. I’m fine with it for my sixth grader — he’ll use it for many years. But for my eleventh grader, he will only use it for a year or two. At Dh2,250 per tablet, the investment is heavy,” Soussi said.“On top of this, we’ve had to pay 15 per cent higher school fees this year. September is the highest month in terms of school costs, it’s a good sum of money.”Indian expat Venicia D’Mello, another Dubai resident, said the first instalment is “always the biggest chunk” in schooling expenses for her son and daughter.Parents and students shopping school accessories at Khalidiya Lulu hypermarket ahead of school re-opening after summer vaccation in Abu Dhabi. Courtesy: Ahmed Kutty/Gulf News“It’s always there in the back of your head, that you must budget for it. Then you go on holiday and it kind of eats into that budget,” D’Mello added.Also factoring in is the “shock” of fee hikes, which “you have to double if you have two children in school”, she said.Zeina Shedib, a homemaker from Syria and mother-of-two who lives in Abu Dhabi, said she and her friends have been stressing about paying school fees right after returning from their summer vacations.“Personally, I set aside money every month so that there is enough to pay the Dh8,000 instalment before the start of the school year. It is very tempting to use up the money while on vacation otherwise, and all my friends are stressing about this right now,” Shedib said. Her older daughter is set to start KG2 when the 2016-2017 school year begins, and her annual fees are about Dh22,000.Salma, an Emirati mother-of-three, said the ability to pay in instalments has been a saving grace for her.“My daughters are in public schools, so I don’t have to worry about paying their fees. My son, however, was in a private school, and I was always glad that I didn’t have to pay the Dh30,000 fee in one go right after our summer vacations,” she said.Top back-to-school adjustments:Diane NewtonSchool runDiane Newton, Australian: “Picking up my children from school is always a nightmare, with all the traffic and the lined up cars. It is never fun, but I simply try to get there early and tell myself that it is just one of the things we must all deal with.”Akshata FernandesRoutineAkshata Fernandes, Indian: “Getting back into a set routine is hard, but we try to excite my fourth-grade daughter about the fun things she will learn at school and ease her into the process. We also buy her new school items, like a backpack or stationery, and tell her that she can only use them if she gets to school on time.”Deepak DahiyaSleepDeepak Dahiya, Indian: “I drop off my two children to school. Using a school bus would have made the day start too early. I adjust my bed time earlier so I can wake up early enough for my children — and for my work. It works out well. We get to spend some quality time together.”Sunil SukumaranShoppingSunil Sukumaran, British: “The week before school starts can be intense. You have to shop for stationery, supplies, etc. Yes, good prices are important but so is good quality. So you have to shop around if you want a good deal. Uniform and books I pick up from the school itself.”

Left turns and U-turns at the intersection of Al Sufouh-Al Gharbi streets to open in SeptemberDubai: Two new left turns and two U-turn will open along the route of Dubai Tram from early next month, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) announced on Monday.Located at the intersection of Al Sufouh-Al Gharbi streets between Jumeirah Beach Residence 1 and Jumeirah Beach Residence 2 stations, the opening of the turns will make life easier for motorists.All left and U-turns were closed ahead of the opening of Dubai Tram in November 2014 to ensure road safety.The closure of the turns ensured that there were zero tram-related accidents.According to RTA, the reopening is being done after ensuring that road users are accustomed to the existence and movement of the tram.This is the third location along the tramway that has seen an opening of left and U-turns this year.In March, the intersection of Al Sayora-Al Sufouh streets and Al Marsa-Al Sufouh streets at Jumeirah Beach Residence saw the opening of all turns, while in June Al Marsa-Al Sharta streets intersection saw a similar development.According to Maitha Mohammad Bin Adai, CEO of RTA’s Traffic and Roads Agency, a committee of specialists was set up and an international consultant was appointed to draw up a comprehensive plan to realise the Tram/Roads Safety Strategy.“The plan encompasses organisational procedures encapsulated in 15 strategic recommendations integrated in a five-year plan covering programmes, procedures and initiatives undertaken in collaboration with strategic partners with the aim of achieving zero accidents level in the operation of the Dubai Tram by 2020,” said Bin Adai.She added that several preventive measures have been set to eliminate potential accidents between the tram and vehicles at the intersection of Al Marsa-Al Gharbi streets.“The team overseeing the plan has developed the Tram/Roads Strategy comprising numerous quick solutions including the signing off of more than 100 issues related to the safety of the tram and traffic movement as part of an Action Plan. It comprises several aspects relating to engineering matters, traffic movement, operation of light signals, awareness campaigns, training, traffic enforcement measures, and coordination of technical and administrative procedures with strategic partners,” she noted.As part of the safe signalling procedure, all traffic lights turn red when a tram approaches the junction.Special surveillance cameras have been installed to monitor vehicles jumping the red signal in coordination with the General Department of Traffic at Dubai Police.“The Dubai Tram is equipped with sophisticated technologies to alert speeding tram drivers, and automatically reduce the speed in case of no response from the driver. There is a code of conduct applicable to tram drivers committing multiple offences and posing risks to road users,” she said.
Subject-focused workshops and training sessions for teachers, career counsellors and health safety officersAbu Dhabi: Public school teachers are being trained this week in various subject areas before the start of the 2016-2017 school year, the Abu Dhabi Education Council (Adec) announced in a statement sent today (August 22).According to the emirate’s education sector regulator, the training will focus on the teaching and assessment methods for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects, including physics, chemistry, biology, maths and digital technology innovation. This year on, maths and science subjects for Grade 9 pupils will be taught in English. This leaves just three more grades, Grade 10 to 12, that are taught STEM content in Arabic.The training is being delivered by faculty heads, academic quality experts and Adec curriculum developers. In addition to STEM subject workshops, there is also additional training for teachers of subjects such as Arabic, Islamic Education, Social Studies, Geo Science, Art, Music and English.At the same time, health safety officers are being briefed on their roles and methodologies, while psychology experts at Cycle 3 schools (Grades 10 to 12) are being trained to provide career counselling advice to pupils.Teachers have also begun their classroom preparations this week in anticipation of pupils returning to school next Sunday (August 28).
Pilgrims urged to come four hours ahead of flight and carry all required documentsDubai: The first flight carrying pilgrims from Dubai will leave on August 24, said a senior official.Transit passengers passing through Dubai on their way to Saudi Arabia for Haj have started arriving at Dubai Airports starting last week.Mohammad Al Marzouqi, deputy head of the Haj Committee at Dubai Airports, said at a press conference on Monday announcing preparations for the Haj 2016 season, that like every year, Dubai Airports has worked together with its strategic partners to ease procedures for Haj pilgrims.“It should take pilgrims no more than 15 minutes from entering the airport to getting to the departure gates. However, we urge all pilgrims to be at the airport at least four hours in advance,” he said.There will be counters in all three Dubai Airports terminals to receive pilgrims and there will be signs all over the terminals to guide them, “There will also be trained staff members wearing ‘how can I help you?’ T-shirts who are ready to help the pilgrims with anything,” he said.There will be golf carts to help transport the elderly or people with disabilities inside the airport.“We have also dedicated a hotline 04-5055588 for any inquiries regarding Haj flight timings,” Al Marzouqi said.He added that Dubai Airports will waive parking fees for people picking up their friends and family when returning from Haj.“Emirates airline has five daily flights to Saudi Arabia, two to Madinah and three to Jeddah, but they have scheduled 12 additional flights to cope with the number of pilgrims travelling for Haj. Flydubai has also added four additional flights and so did Saudi Arabian Airlines,” Al Marzouqi said.He said that Emirates airline expects to carry around 15,000 pilgrims from Dubai to Saudi Arabia during this Haj season. “Of the 15,000, we expect 2,500 to be from the UAE,” he said.He said that they have dedicated the closer gates to people travelling for Haj.Pilgrims, both Emiratis and expatriates with a valid UAE visa, can use their Emirates ID cards to get through the e-gates at the arrivals in Terminal 3.“There are also six e-gates where pilgrims can use their ID cards at the departures in Terminal 3. We will soon be announcing the service in Terminals 1 and 2,” said Major Waleed Saeed from the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners affairs.He added that the service is available if people want to try it, but there would be no need as passport control procedures will be expedited for pilgrims.As has been the case for a number of years now, the UAE’s Haj quota remains 4,982 people, according to Bandar Bin Sultan Al Yamahi from the Saudi Consulate.The ongoing expansion works at the Grand Mosque in Makkah continue to restrict the number of pilgrims that can be accommodated.Al Yamahi said of the 4,982 quota, 4,631 is for Emiratis and 351 for expatriates.“We have 164 expatriates registered for Haj from Dubai and the northern emirates. We have received a number of their applications and we are waiting for the others. We urge the Haj operators to send people’s papers as soon as possible so we can have their visa ready before their flights. The last day for issuing Haj visas is 25 Dhu Al Qa’da [August 28],” he said.He said that all people travelling for Haj need an e-passport, a Haj visa, and to be registered on the online Haj portal.Badr Al Najjar, from the Ministry of Health, said it is also crucial for pilgrims to get the required vaccinations and to carry the yellow vaccination card with them, so they are allowed into Saudi Arabia.“People should make sure they get meningitis and flu vaccinations before travelling,” he said, adding that the vaccinations are available at all the ministry’s health centres across the UAE.He said that the ministry advises pilgrims to drink lots of water and try to stay in the shade to avoid dehydration and heat stroke in this weather.The ministry will have a stand at the airport where pilgrims can have some basic medical checks.The Department of Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities official Haj mission will include 65 pilgrims from different Dubai government entities, of which 15 are employees of the department, who will be taking care of the mission, said Saeed Bin Duwayah, a representative from the department.The mission will be travelling to Madinah on September 9, then travel after 4 days to Makkah and will return to the UAE on September 16. 
Three men banned from travelling for six months to track any changes in behaviourAbu Dhabi: A top UAE court on Monday ordered an Emirati and two Comoro Islands citizens to be sent to a counselling centre of the Ministry of Interior for six months for posing a potential terror threat to the country. The men were also banned from travelling for the same period.The Federal Supreme Court, presided over by judge Shihab Al Hammadi, found Taha Saeed Abdullah Al Mashjari, Emirati, 27; Ebrahim Morad Nawab Al Beloushi, 25, and Khalifa Mohammad Abdullah Al Beloushi, 21, from the Comoro Islands, guilty of posing a potential terror threat to the country as they held the terrorist ideology of Al Qaida, Daesh and other terrorist organisations.The men will be monitored and banned from travelling for six months to track any changes in their ideology and behaviour, according to the court.Prosecutors told the court that the defendants travelled to a number of countries to meet people wanted for belonging to terrorist organisations.“The men attempted to communicate with members of terrorist organisations operating in Iraq and Syria. They searched websites of a number of terrorist groups and downloaded video clips showing terrorist operations committed by these organisations and poems praising their crimes,” a prosecutor said.The prosecutor added that the men admitted downloading “jihadist” songs inciting people to commit violence and to fight in Iraq and Syria.According to UAE’s anti-terror law, convicted terrorists face life imprisonment and fines of up to Dh100 million.The law defines a terrorist offence as “any action or inaction made a crime by this law and every action or inaction made a crime by any other law if they are carried out for a terrorist cause”.A terrorist intent is established by a direct or indirect terrorist action or when an offender is aware of the consequences of such actions or inaction. The government established counselling centres where convicted terrorists will receive intensive religious and welfare counselling in jails in a programme targeted against future threats posed by those holding extremist views.Counselling centresThe counselling centres provide intensive religious and welfare counselling in jails in a programme targeted against future threats posed by those holding extremist views, according to the UAE anti-terror law.The law states that a potential terror threat is established if a person holds extremist or terrorist ideology which may cause the person to commit a terrorist crime. Such a person is sent to a counselling centre on request from the prosecution.
Campaign collects the largest amount of clothing for donations in the worldImage Credit: Ahmed Ramzan/Gulf NewsFrom left: Ageel Angawi, Leila Eisa, marketing manager, Mena, Guinness World Records, and Mohammad Abdullah Al Haj Al Zarouni with the Guinness World Record certificate in Dubai.Dubai: Dubai has created another world record by collecting 295,122 items of clothing for donation as a part of an annual initiative that took place in the UAE and Qatar from the start of Ramadan until July 6.The campaign ‘Share a touch of love’, was organised by fabric cleaning brands OMO and Comfort with the aim of donating clothes to those in need around the world, through the help of Emirates Red Crescent.The record was set at 293,623 items, which was collected in India last year. The new record was made official by Guinness World Records during a ceremony at Armani Hotel, Dubai on Monday.The collection drive encouraged residents in the UAE and Qatar to make a donation by dropping off their clothes at any of 63 locations, which include dozens of in-mall stands.Residents also had the option of calling the chauffeur cab booking service, Careem, to arrange for collection from their home free of charge.“This is the seventh year we have run the campaign in the UAE and every year we witness a remarkable increase in the number of people giving back. We would like to thank the people of the UAE who have supported the campaign passionately and helped us break the Guinness World Record title three years in a row,” said Ageel Angawi, Homecare vice-president for Unilever North Africa and Middle East.The campaign has reached over 800,000 people in need around the world over the last seven years, with donations this year going to five refugee camps in Iraq and two camps in Jordan.“This campaign truly embodies the spirit of giving in Ramadan and is another proof of the great values rooted in the people living in this country. Those donations will help several people in need and we will continue with the help of our partners to support the nations that require our attention and focus on reaching to as many people as we can,” said Mohammad Abdullah Al Haj Al Zarouni, general manager of the Dubai branch of Emirates Red Crescent.He confirmed the campaign will take place next year, and will focus on another humanitarian aspect.

The iOS app called Lifestage was designed by 19-year-old Michael Sayman, a Facebook product manager.Dubai: A new app launched by Facebook for teenagers aims to be the next hit in the social media world, by giving under-21s an easy way to keep a daily video diary.The new iOS app called Lifestage, was designed by 19-year-old Michael Sayman, a Facebook Product Manager, with the aim of creating a teens-only social networking site.High school and college students will have to select the educational institution they are studying in when registering, and will only be able to see other users when 20 people from their school are registered on the app.However, what makes this app different is the way it profiles a user’s information.“It asks for your happy face, sad face, likes, dislikes, best friend, the way you dance and more — but not by typing out a biography quiz with text. Instead, you’re asked to shoot video clips, which are attached to your video profile, for others to watch,” said social media specialist Tahani Karrar-Lewsley from Menar Media.She explained that while no app can guarantee 100 per cent safety against cyber threats and bullying, the age-specific app is primarily built for high-schoolers under 21 to learn more about their classmates.“Technically, anyone can download Lifestage, but users who are 22 years old or older will only be able to see their own profile. Users can also block and report people who you think should not be on the app with a quick swipe,” said Karrar-Lewsley.The reason behind the sudden launch of the app could be attributed to the fact that other social media apps like Snapchat and Instagram have attracted millions of teenagers and young adults.“There are fears that teens are slipping away from Facebook to Snapchat so this can be seen as a good way to reach out to those on Snapchat. Lifestage has integrated promo materials like “Snapchat me”, and Facebook has repeatedly said it sees itself evolving into a video content platform and, ultimately, a virtual and augmented reality platform — so this app is a great way of testing and evolving this move for a younger audience who are open to communicating in video,” added Karrar-Lewsley.However, with Facebook’s poor track record with standalone apps, having shut down Poke, Slingshot, Paper and Notify, only time will tell if Lifestage will be the next big thing.UAE resident Sarah K., who is from Bahrain, said she supports the idea of the app, and hopes young adults and teenagers will shift from using other social media apps to the restricted-age app Lifestage.“I have a younger sister and I do worry about who is viewing her profile and what kinds of threats she is exposed to on sites people from all over the world and all ages are using daily,” said Sarah.She pointed out the Lifestage app monitors students’ information, which helps eliminate indecent users and possible cyber threats.Just the same, Palestinian Samer Mohammad, 20, said he is excited to try out the new app, but will not stop using Facebook and other social media sites.“It’s a cool concept because it brings the student community together, but at the same time you can’t stay in touch with older family members and friends on the app. I would say it’s a good addition to the social media world,” he said.
Ministry of Infrastructure Development completes housing project in Al Taween area in FujairahFujairah: The Ministry of Infrastructure Development has completed 95 per cent of a housing project for citizens in Al Taween area in the emirate of Fujairah.The housing project is expected to be handed over in October.Finishing work is being done at the site after all structural and electro-mechanical work was completed, the ministry said in a report released yesterday (Sunday).The project features two-storey houses, each with three bedrooms, two large traditional sitting rooms (majlis), a guest bedroom, a housemaid’s room, a laundry room, a storeroom and three bathrooms, in addition to an extra kitchen.The ministry said it has also completed 55 per cent of the Cultural Centre in Fujairah.

Dubai: Dubai Civil Defence has achieved an average response time of four minutes for 30 per cent of the fires it handled in 2015.Major General Rashid Thani Al Matroushi, director of Dubai Civil Defence, said that the target average response time for first responders to fires globally is between 6-8 minutes for 90 per cent of fire incidents.His comments came during a visit to Al Hamriya fire station on Sunday.Maj Gen Al Matroushi commended the level of readiness of the firefighting teams and their speedy response to any fire incidents.He urged the public to cooperate with the Civil Defence, as the public plays a key role in determining the team’s response time.“The person reporting the incident needs to be as clear as possible, giving details such as the type and location of the incident, and any additional information that would affect the time it takes to reach the site of the incident,” he explained.It is also crucial for road users to make way for emergency vehicles such as fire trucks, so they can get to the fire as soon as possible.“People should be alert to the sirens and make way accordingly. People should also ensure there is a path for easy access at the site of the fire, so firefighters can do their job,” Maj Gen Al Matroushi said.Dubai Civil Defence, he said, is always keen on making use of best international practices to continuously improve its performance, including reducing the average response time in line with highest international standards.“We measure our success through customer satisfaction, and we have achieved this through the excellent performance of our firefighters, including those working at Al Hamriya station,” he added.
American nuclear experts train federal UAE staff on prevention of illicit nuclear equipment imports and exportsDubai: Nuclear energy experts from the United States are helping the UAE bolster existing border protection measures against illicit shipments of nuclear equipment or materials related to weapons of mass destruction, said federal officials on Sunday.The United States Department of Energy’s International and Export Control programme experts met over three days with more than a dozen staff members of the UAE’s Federal Authority for Nuclear Regulation (FANR).The American export control programme is designed to “strengthen global efforts to prevent any unlicensed transfer of materials, equipment, and technology related to weapons of mass destruction (WMD), including nuclear weapons”, said the UAE regulator.Christer Viktorsson, director-general of FANR, told Gulf News on Sunday that training staff who review material transfers will enforce strict international agreements that call for only peaceful nuclear equipment and materials to be transferred across borders.“As a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the UAE is committed to conducting only peaceful nuclear activities within its borders and also to working with the international community to prevent the illicit transfer of nuclear-weapon-usable materials and technologies,” Viktorsson said in an interview on Sunday.“Our recent workshop with the US Department of Energy assisted FANR staff members who review all trade applications to transfer nuclear-related items to, from, or through the UAE.”Viktorsson noted that effective “trade controls are essential tools in international efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, FANR is fully committed to its leading role in the UAE to support these non-proliferation strategies”.The workshop is part and parcel of new safety regulations imposed by FANR on the Western Region’s Barakah nuclear power plant where the first of four reactor units are expected to go online next year.All four nuclear reactors are set for completion by 2020 to provide up to a quarter of the country’s electricity demands yearly.Federal powers of FANR staff as laid out under FANR’s Regulation 9 were reviewed as part of the training for a better understanding of “national export control licensing, industry compliance, and inspections-based enforcement practices designed to prevent the uncontrolled transfer of sensitive items that could be used to build WMD”, said the federal authority.The UAE has pledged to use nuclear energy, equipment and technology “exclusively for peaceful purposes only and to implement import and export control rules for nuclear and nuclear-related equipment and technology in strict accordance with Nuclear Supplier Group (NSG) Guidelines for Nuclear Transfers. The NSG is a group of nuclear supplier countries that seeks to contribute to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons through the implementation of two sets of guidelines for nuclear exports and nuclear-related exports”, the authority said. Ensuring inspectionsAccording to FANR’s Regulation 9 governing import and export of nuclear-related materials, UAE inspectors have full powers to inspect any shipment or premises involved in items related to nuclear power in the country.The law reads that licensees “shall allow access, without any delay, to the authority to conduct an inspection, which the authority deems to be related to the transfer of regulated items, to verify the correctness and the completeness of the information provided and in compliance with the requirements of the law, this regulation and with conditions of the relevant licences”.The law also makes its clear that “the authority’s inspectors are authorised to inspect industrial sites, stores or any other sites or locations in the state where regulated items are declared to be located, including, but not limited to, special and free zones in order to … ensure that such items are used for peaceful purposes in accordance with the obligations of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons”.The regulations will help inspectors “investigate any suspicion that the transfer or end use of regulated items is unlicensed or unauthorised”. 
Sharjah: A 26-year-old Egyptian man died after his car crashed into a shop in Sharjah on Friday while trying to navigate a roundabout.Police said the driver lost control of his vehicle when it veered off the road in Al Majara area and crashed.There was damage to the shop but no one inside was injured, police said.A Sharjah Police official told Gulf News that the driver, identified as K.T., was pronounced dead at the scene of the incident.Early investigation by Wasit police station officers suggests the man died from heart-related problems given that the victim has a medical history of cardiac problems and had undergone heart surgery to install a device to maintain a regular heart beat.Police arrived at the scene of the incident and had to remove the car from the shop.The body of the deceased was taken to Al Kuwaiti Hospital.Wasit police station launched an investigation into the incident.Meanwhile, traffic authorities in UAE stress the importance of any person wanting to obtain driving licence undergoing a full medical check-up for their safety and that of road users.Recently, UAE traffic authorities said they plan to link the Ministry of Health database to traffic police networks to ensure drivers do not suffer from chronic diseases to prevent deadly accidents caused by ill drivers.The latest crash comes after a 22-year-old Emirati driver suffered an epileptic fit at the wheel of his pick-up truck on July 17 and ploughed into a MacDonald’s restaurant at an Eppco station in Al Hamidiya area in Ajman.The freak accident killed a 45-year-old Indian woman and a nine-year-old Iraqi boy while injuring six others. Three of the six injured people were children.Colonel Abdullah Al Hamrani, deputy chief of Ajman Police, said at the time that the “accident was caused due to the driver suffering a severe epilepsy attack. He lost control of the vehicle after stepping on the accelerator, sending the vehicle crashing into the glass window of a McDonald’s”.
Dubai Municipality allows converting gyms on building roofs into housing or officesDubai: A resolution allowing property owners to convert gyms on the roofs of buildings located beyond the Central Business District, into housings or offices has been issued.Eng Hussain Nasser Lootah, director-general of Dubai Municipality, issued the resolution upon a request to modify the use of gym space in these buildings to residential use or as offices.According to the resolution, altering gyms on buildings’ roofs is allowed only if the gym is set up on the building’s roof space. Also, the gym space in residential buildings cannot be used to set up studio apartments.The resolution stressed the need to abide by rules and regulations related to providing parking in new buildings. For old and already existing buildings, the resolution increases the parking deficit by 5 per cent more to deal with cases in which alternative technical and engineering solutions are impossible.It also emphasises the need to adhere to rules and regulations pertaining to planning and structural modifications as well as to building code regulations and construction specifications.Fees stipulated in case of changing the use of gyms to residential use or offices should be levied from property owners.
Sukaina with Dr Ahmad Thabet (right) and Dr Robert Veres. During the surgical procedure, the doctors cut part of the skull bone and adjusted it to make room for her brain.Abu Dhabi: Sukaina is able to walk on her own again, after fearing that she would have to live the rest of her life as a quadriplegic.After living a normal life, the 11-year-old from Morocco suddenly began losing all ability to move her hands and legs.Her frantic parents did not know what was happening to her, and after six months of seeing their daughter’s condition worsening, they decided to seek specialist medical advice.It was then that a rare congenital genetic deformity was revealed.Sukaina, one of a pair of identical twins, had a displaced vertebra near the neck that was compressing her brain stem, the part of the brain that controls essential internal mechanisms like heartbeat and respiration.Sukaina, who was admitted to Mafraq Hospital, and her family were then told about a 10-hour surgery that was expected to help her regain her limb functions.“Sukaina had sustained a neck injury from a fall earlier this year. This led to her displaced vertebra becoming unstable and compressing her brain stem,” explained Dr Ahmad Thabet, specialist neurosurgeon at Mafraq Hospital.“Children fall a lot, but injuries to the neck should not be ignored. Parents should seek specialist medical advice if a child has hurt himself or herself around the neck as such injuries can sometimes become fatal,” he cautioned.The doctor said Sukaina, whose condition had been deteriorating, could have ended up bedridden without the right treatment.“Her deformity could even have become fatal because breathing difficulties would eventually arise,” he added.During the surgical procedure, Dr Robert Veres, consultant neurosurgeon at Mafraq Hospital, and Dr Thabet, along with two other doctors, cut part of the skull bone and adjusted it to ‘make room’ for her brain. They then attached the skull with a metal fixture to the vertebrae at an angle that would allow Sukaina normal movement.She was hospitalised for two weeks following the operation, and was soon able to move her hands and slowly walk on her own.“Sukaina’s future treatment will involve a follow-up in six months’ time, and regular physiotherapy,” Dr Thabet said.He also urged parents not to play down trauma to the neck region.“Sukaina’s congenital deformity and case is extremely rare, but all neck injuries should be prioritised and treated,” he said.
Heavy bags can put unhealthy strain on childrenImage Credit: Arshad Ali/Gulf News ArchivesThe Abu Dhabi Education Council specifies that bags for primary school pupils should not exceed 480 grammes.Abu Dhabi: Primary school pupils should not carry school bags heavier than 10 per cent of their body weight in order to ensure their health and safety, education officials have said.The emirate of Abu Dhabi’s education sector regulator, the Abu Dhabi Education Council (Adec), specifies that this means bags for primary school pupils should not exceed 480 grams, while those for middle and high school children should be 580 grams or lighter.In directives issued by the Adec earlier, education officials stressed that schools bags can put “an unhealthy strain on children’s backs if they become too heavy”. Children were therefore urged only to carry books that they need for the day.Most importantly, parents are advised not to take schoolbag-related pains lightly but to consult specialist doctors if children complain of pain.For loads that become too heavy to carry, parents should consider buying a bag with wheels. Other recommendations include the need to ensure that the bag is not wider than the child’s shoulders, and that its lowest point when carried is less than 10cm under the hips.A front belt that can be wrapped around the waist for even distribution of the weight is advised, while shoulder straps that are wide and lined can avoid pressure on muscles.While parents should ensure that children do not pack unnecessary items in their bags, schools are also urged to provide lockers for all children and teachers should be mindful of the books that need to be carried when setting the daily schedule. Classes for first to sixth grades should also be on the ground floor so that young children who are prone to bag-related injuries do not have to climb stairs.
Dubai: A fleet of sophisticated new buses will operate as part of Dubai Taxi Corporation’s (DTC) school services for the new academic year, starting next month.According to Mohammad Saeed Al Dhuhori, director of DTC’s School Transport services, the new fleet is part of DTC’s commitment to keep up with the Dubai Government’s drive to provide excellent and safe school transport service.He said that registration is now open for students to avail of this school transport service at the schools under contract.More than 3,000 students from eight schools are currently benefiting from DTC’s school transport services.“The DTC is deploying scores of new eco-friendly buses, fitted with the best safety and security means. The new buses would be deployed at the beginning of the new academic year to add up to DTC’s existing school bus fleet to meet the growing demands for transport service,” said Al Dhuhori.He added that the new buses are equipped with surveillance cameras connected to the DTC’s Control Centre.“These cameras can monitor students’ movement on board as well as when they are alighting and board the bus. Our buses are also fitted with a GPS satellite tracking system, which sends text messages to inform parents of bus times from and to schools or homes,” he said.To ensure no student is left behind in the bus, DTC’s new school bus fleet is also fitted with a switch located at the rear of the bus that requires the driver to walk there to disable it.DTC has made open online contract registration facility for new schools to avail of this service. The service can also be used on DTC’s school bus smart app as well as by dialling the DTC’s Customer Service Centre 042080555 or visiting the customer service staff at schools.
Work on the bus stops will begin soon after a six-month-long study by Sharjah Roads and Transport Authority.Sharjah: Sharjah is to have solar-powered air-conditioned bus shelters soon, the Sharjah Urban Planning Council (SUPC) announced on Sunday.His Highness Dr Shaikh Sultan Bin Mohammad Al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of Sharjah, has approved the first phase of the project to build bus shelters in the emirate.Out of the 172 designated bus stops in the city, the first phase will see the development of 28 bus shelters.The project is being carried out following a six-month-long study by Sharjah Roads and Transport Authority (SRTA). The study identified the most crowded areas frequented by public transport users and covers 176,000 passengers.The shelters will be equipped with air-conditioning as other necessary amenities such as an electronic bulletin board that displays all information related to bus service timetables and routes.Being developed by SUPC, in collaboration with SRTA and Sharjah Electricity and Water Authority (Sewa), work on the bus stops will begin shortly.Announcing the project Shaikh Khalid Bin Sultan Al Qasimi, chairman of SUPC, said: “SUPC is constantly striving to design plans and strategies in support of projects that provide the best services to the public in the emirate of Sharjah. These efforts help improve the welfare of the existing residents and that of future generations. We aim to establish sustainable infrastructure that boosts the appeal of the emirate as a desirable place to live in, one that provides facilities in accordance with the highest international standards.”Khalid Mohammad Al Ali, secretary-general of SUPC, said that the shelters will have a simple yet highly functional design and structure.“Each shelter was designed taking into account the needs and capacity of each location. All shelters will be provided with solar energy panels for electricity production in compliance with the sustainability standards that SUPC is committed to upholding in all its current projects in the emirate of Sharjah,” said Al Ali.
Dubai: The hottest days of the year are finally over. Starting on August 22, temperatures will drop gradually.Forecasters at the National Centre of Meteorology and Seismology (NCMS) said the average temperatures will drop by about one degree Celsius to 2C.“As we know [geographically] we’re nearing the end of the summer season, and the temperature will begin to drop gradually. If the maximum temperature before was 40C to 49C, reaching 50C, now it’s going to be between 35C and 45C. The air mass covering our area is changing from very dry and very hot to hot with some humidity,” a forecaster told Gulf News.The forecaster said the weather will continue to be hot but the mercury is no longer going to rise and will actually be on a downward trend. The maximum temperature in Abu Dhabi on Monday, for example, will be 41C, while the rest of the country will have a maximum of 37C to 45C, sometimes reaching 46C.An exception will be desert areas like Umm Azimul, Madinat Zayed, and other southern areas as they may still record temperatures between 46C and 47C on some days, but not on all days.“The drop in temperature is because as the Earth rotates on its axis and revolves around the sun, the northern hemisphere, where the UAE is, gets farther from the sun. The intensity of the sun’s rays hitting the northern hemisphere weakens because the rays reach the earth at a low angle and are no longer perpendicular to the UAE during the summer months,” the forecaster said.Because of this, the day is shorter now by one hour compared to during Ramadan.Humidity levels will also decrease to a maximum of 70 per cent over most areas, including Dubai. But the western coastal areas will still have maximum levels reaching 90 to 95 per cent.“In July and August, the UAE is affected by the extension of the Indian monsoon. It’s now weakening and going towards the east. We are now seeing the mixture of these two air masses — hot air from the Indian monsoon and modified air from northern hemisphere.”The forecaster said that the next three days will continue to be “rather hot during the day and maybe moderate during night”. Clouds are expected to form over the eastern mountains and southern part of the UAE, with a small chance of rainfall.
Dubai: As children return to school, the issue of heavy bags raises its ugly head once again.Until last year students in UAE were found to be carrying school bags that were 20 to 25 per cent of their body weight when the admissible limit is only 10 per cent of body weight.Dr Yash Gulati, spine and total knee replacement specialist at RAK Hospital, told Gulf News: “Carrying schools bags more than 10 per cent of one’s body weight can cause muscle spasms around the back and neck. Children need help to have their backpacks hauled on their back and usually carry the weight on one side of their back. This tilted weight can cause a permanent tilted posture and although there is no evidence of permanent spine deformity, the weight does cause long-term aches, pains, fatigue and irritability which affects the student’s performance and can cause issues like lower back pain and spondylosis in the long term.”Despite the initiation of e-learning and locker system in schools, children continue to carry bags that are very heavy. Some children prefer to carry trolley bags, but the trolley paraphernalia adds to the weight and while boarding and alighting from a school bus and climbing stairs to the classroom picking up the trolley bag is far more tedious than the regular backpack and proves counter- productive.The school bag weight has been hotly debated by parent–teacher fora and yet no conclusive decision has been made.On any given day, a child spends eight hours at school and at least 1.5 hours travelling to and from school. In these hours he is required to carry his bag for a total of 30 minutes or more. The bags contain at least five textbooks, three workbooks, five notebooks, one rough book, a school calendar, compass box and tiffin box.If the child goes for tuitions after school, usually those books are also put into the school bag, adding to the weight. If one were to multiply that by 25 days and then by the number of years the student carries the bag, it adds up to several years of load carrying that can have a detrimental impact on the spine, particularly in the case of weak-bodied students.Dr Sunjay Sureen, specialist orthopaedician at Prime Hospital, told Gulf News: “Normally if a child weighs 30kg, his school bag must not exceed 5kg. But when the parents come to me with their children complaining of head and neck pain, I have discovered these students to be carrying at least 10-12kg weight in their school bags. For children, especially in the 10 -1 4 years age group when the musculo-skeletal structure is still developing, this kind of weight can cause both short-term and long-term problems.”In a 2006 study conducted by the College of Physiotherapy, Trinity College of Dublin, on the weight of school bags, researchers S. Dockrell, C. Kane and O. Keefe had mentioned that the school bag weight must not exceed 10 per cent of the body weight and had drawn up a body discomfort chart which ranged from plain fatigue to head and neck pain.Dr Sureen cautioned: “Never ignore your child’s complaints of tiredness and fatigue. The general body discomfort of carrying heavy bags is usually manifested in the short term by these complaints. Our bodies are usually resilient and adapt to the discomfort. But that is not the case with all. Any child who has a predisposition to scoliosis [unnatural curvature of the spine] or is weak-built is likely to feel the pain and discomfort more sharply and, if left unattended, it could aggravate and impact the child’s performance at school.”A joint action based on recommendations from school and suggestions from parents is required to address this issue and relieve children of this burden. Attempts to get a statement from any school representatives on the topic were not successful.  Parents speakThe weight of children school bags has always been a contentious issue. Though I am lucky as my daughter studies in GEMS Wellington Silicon Oasis, and the curriculum doesn’t require them to carry heavy textbooks to school every day, still there are days when the PE kit, the tiffin, the water bottle and the BYOD ‘e-learning gadgets’ make the bag a bit too heavy for the 9 year olds! I have tried wheeled strolleys to take the weight off her shoulders. But I had to revert to a backpack as students are encouraged to use the stairs in school (and rightly so) and it becomes impossible to drag the strolleys down the stairs.Neha KaulMother to a 9-year-old girl Kuya Don Don Esmael, father of a 9-year-old boyMy son is in year 4 at a Dubai school and I often despair seeing him carrying a bag weighing 8kg when his weight is not more than 25kg. Although the school where he is studying has introduced a series of steps to lighten the bag, I still see that on most days he carries several text books, notebooks, pencil box, and tiffin box and this makes him tired. I am going to raise this issue at the next PTA. Tips to avoid heavy bag injuries1. Listen to your child if he often complains of headaches and muscle pains and take him for a periodic screening to an orthopaedic clinic. He might be getting a neck spasm2. Schools need to rework their schedule that they do not have more than three subjects in a day. They could have focused teaching in those subjects spread over two lectures so that the child needs to carry just three text books and a couple of notebooks3. There could be a common work book for sciences, maths and English to reduce the load4. Teachers can be encouraged to give online home work to be completed electronically so that class work books and other essentials can be kept in lockers at schools5. Children can have supervised study hours after school to finish their homework and minimise carrying work home. Alternatively a supervisor needs to make sure that a child is not loaded with homework that requires him to carry several books to class for correction.6. Lunch and breakfast and water bottles could be provided at school to reduce the weight of lunch boxes7. Children must be encouraged to have more active time at school where they can move around8. Younger children in the 8-11 age group must have classes on the ground floor to avoid the stress of climbing stairs with weight on their back.9. School clinics that carry routine examination of children must specially focus on head and neck stress and alert a paediatrician or orthopaedic specialist if a child has persistent pain or spasm.
Dubai: A policeman was charged with the attempted murder of two men following an altercation at a Dubai nightclub, that ended with him stabbing both men with a knife.S.H.A.S., a 41-year-old policeman, was off duty when he stabbed A.H.Y.A., 30, a Jordanian salesman, and K.Y.A., 27, a Syrian marketing manager, on February 19, the Dubai Public Prosecution charge sheet showed.The policeman and another Emirati, A.E.K.M., 35, a government employee, were charged with assaulting A.H.Y.A and and K.Y.A.. The charge sheet also showed the two Emiratis were under the influence of alcohol.A.H.Y.A. and and K.Y.A., and their 27-year-old Lebanese friend, J.B.T., were charged with assaulting the two Emiratis.The incident took place following a verbal altercation at a nightclub in a Dubai hotel.A security guard from the hotel told the prosecution that the two Emirati men got into an argument with J.B.T. at around 3am, and they were escorted out before the matter escalated.Once outside, he said, the men started fighting again and were joined by K.Y.A. and A.H.Y.A.The Lebanese man then grabbed a metal object from the parking lot and attempted to attack the two Emirati men, but the security guards managed to stop him.Meanwhile, the two Emiratis and the other two men got into a fist fight, which led to the Emirati policeman stabbing them with a sharp object.The security guards heard one of the men scream and pulled them apart.The forensic examiner’s report said if the Jordanian man had not received immediate medical intervention, he would have died, as one of his stab wounds was severe.The hotel security called for an ambulance that took the two men to Rashid Hospital.The Jordanian man was stabbed twice, one deep stab wound to the chest and one superficial stab wound to the back, and the Syrian was stabbed once in his waist.All five suspects confessed to their charges.
Al Rashidiya police station will train around 15 Enoc employees to report minor traffic accident Dubai: Soon people will be able to report minor accidents at three Enoc petrol stations.Al Rashidiya police station will train around 15 Enoc employees to report minor traffic accidents on the Dubai Police smartphone app, so people can go to petrol stations instead of the police station to avoid queues.Brigadier Saeed Hamad Bin Sulaiman, director of Al Rashidiya police station, said that the new initiative will be tested out in three Enoc stations in the police station’s area of jurisdiction and that the training will take three months. He was addressing at a press conference on Sunday.“During the three months of training, a police officer will be at the station at all times to ensure the staff are filling the forms correctly,” he said.The 24/7 service will be available at three Enoc stations: Al Wasn station on Tripoli Street, Al Yamamah station on Mohammad Bin Zayed Road (Abu Dhabi bound) and the Bypass Road station, also on Mohammad Bin Zayed Road (Sharjah bound).“We choose those three stations because most minor accidents occur on roads near them, according to our traffic statistic. The majority — 80 per cent — of traffic accidents in our area of jurisdiction are minor,” he said.Al Rashidiya police station gets an average of 200-250 minor accident reports a day, which he said could be easily reported using the Dubai Police smartphone app if both parties are in agreement.“This new initiative aims to raise more awareness of the app, which people can use themselves. The Enoc employees will also try to teach people how to use the app’s feature. The initiative will also help reduce the number of visitors to the police station,” he said.Reporting a minor accident, where both parties are in agreement on who is at fault, takes three minutes, “but if they come to the police station it depends on how long it takes them to get to the station and the queue system when they get there. It may take more than an hour to report their case if the station is busy, while the workd could have been done in minutes if they used the app,” he said.While some people are still reluctant to use the app, Brig Bin Sulaiman explained, “Some might have a smartphone but do not have internet access, and some do not have the app. This is where the service at Enoc stations would help,” he said.When you report an accident through the app, you get the accident report through e-mail or SMS a few minutes after successfully filing out the forms and attaching the required pictures.“We will assess this trial phase and, if the results are a success, we will recommend this to the authorities at Dubai Police, so after its approval it could be applied to various stations across the city,” he said.Trained Enoc staff will wear a reflective yellow vest with the Dubai Police logo so people can identify them.
Free iftar meals, Zakat Al Fitr and Eid clothes distirbuted in many countries in RamadanDubai: Dar Al Ber Society ran three humanitarian projects worth Dh3.21 million in 32 countries during Ramadan.Abdullah Ali Bin Zayed, executive director, Dar Al Ber, said the projects covered iftar meals, Zakat Al Fitr, Eid clothes, and other key projects across the globe.He added that official records show that 133,333 low-income people have benefited from the free iftar meals, saying up to Dh2 million was spent on the mass free iftar meals.The 37-year-old charity association accomplished the mass iftar projects in collaboration with five UAE embassies, 44 charity entities and strategic partners all over the world, Bin Zayed said.“As many as 50 low-income families have benefited from the Dh1,000,000 Zakat Al Fitr project that was carried out in cooperation with 42 strategic charity bodies worldwide,” he added.Meanwhile up to 10,500 low-income families have benefited from the Dh210,000 Eid Clothes project that was accomplished in coordination with 44 strategic charity entities globally, Bin Zayed said.“Thousands of people have also benefited from the 93,000 mass iftar meals, worth Dh989,678, at Al Aqsa mosque in occupied Jerusalem, with the help of charity societies.”
Rush for Emirates ID at a typing centre in Mazaya Centre on Shaikh Zayed Road in Dubai.Dubai: There are currently around 314 typing centres in the UAE still authorised to provide the e-form typing service for Emirates ID, after a grace period to meet new standards expired on July 28, the Emirates Identity Authority has said.Only those typing centres who confirm to new standards, enforced since August 1, can continue accepting the e-form application, which is necessary for the ID card’s issuance or renewal.All other centres that used to provide the Emirates ID typing service are no longer accepting such applications. It wasn’t immediately known how many typing centres in total were offering the service before the new rules came into effect.However, there have been no reports of long waiting lines at the remaining typists. Besides the accredited typing centres, applicants can also continue to visit Tas’heel offices, which provide services for a variety of government transactions, or apply online. There is no Dh30 typing fee when residents choose to apply online.Typists and applicants also confirmed the development to Gulf News recently, with some residents saying they were told by their regular typists to visit Tas’heel instead.All related procedures and fees for applicants remain unchanged. The new standards only apply to typing centres, which were instructed by the authority to upgrade to services such as a queue system, and meet minimum space and staff requirements, among other standards.On August 8, the authority said on its website (www.id.gov.ae) that the new standards would mean better service for applicants at the typing centres.Nasser Al Abdouli, director, Service Centres Support, Emirates ID Authority, said, “Ninety per cent of errors in the customer data entered in the ID system result from errors in the work methods at these offices as they do not meet the basic conditions approved by the authority, which leads to obstructing and delaying the issuance of ID cards”.A spokesman of the authority told Gulf News that the new rules on typing centre came into effect on August 1.Although at the moment 314 typing centres across the country have been authorised, residents can expect more centres in the coming days.“We receive new applications from typing centres on a daily basis, and we give approval to new ones if they meet the new criteria,” the spokesperson said.The authority has also pointed out that it has ensured that customers are able to obtain its services within 10km of their areas. Al Abdouli has explained that the authority excluded the minimum space requirement for offices located in low population areas that are far from major cities, in order to ensure that the service is available for the residents of such areas.For inquiries, the authority can be reached 24/7 on its call centre on 600530003.
Abu Dhabi: Sometimes hassle-free options can take away your peace of mind and stress you out.Over the past one month, Jayant Dhupal and his family back home in India have lost sleep over a consignment that was sent through a Dubai-based door-to-door delivery company — Dynamic Star Packing and Storage L.L.C.Dhupal had booked a 20-feet container for Dh12,500 to ship his household goods to Bhubaneswar, India, but his family is yet to receive it. All that he receives from the agency are false assurances of sorting out the issue within a week or two.“My family has relocated to India and so I wanted to send all my household appliances home. They were supposed to deliver it to my door and even unpack it. They sent the cargo on June 15 and it reached India on July 21 but Dynamic Star’s India handler, Multi Modal Shipping Service Chennai Pvt Ltd, is not ready to release it saying Dynamic Star has not paid their dues,” said an exasperated Dhupal, who works as an engineer at a petroleum company in the capital.Dhupal revealed that it was tough for his wife and son to settle down as they have no appliances or daily necessary items.“It is a struggle since everything is stuck — no fridge, television, washing machine…I even paid Rs24,400 (Dh1,400) customs duty and despite that they haven’t delivered the shipment. There is some financial issue between the two companies and we are suffering,” said Dhupal, who even took matters into his own hands to solve the problem by contacting Multi Modal Shipping Services Chennai Pvt Ltd.“Dynamic Star assured me that they will solve the problem.“They said the company CEO, Biju Shridharan, himself is looking into the matter and is already in India.” “The promised delivery time was one month, so by July 15, the goods were to reach Bhubaneswar but till now nothing has moved. Every day, there is a new excuse. I even mailed their service provider in Chennai but his reply was all the more disturbing,” said Dhupal, showing the mail from Captain Jayadev, who is in charge of Multi Modal Shipping Services. The mail read: “We have laid ‘red carpet’ for Mr Biju to come to our office and settle the money across the table. I have also arranged photographers to come and take this historic moment of receiving the payment from Biju. The same will be sent to you immediately via email and your cargo will leave in two hours from the time the money is received.”Dhupal said that he was constantly in touch with the Chennai-based company and they solely blame Dynamic Star for not paying their dues and hence holding on to his consignment. Dynamic Star’s Jojo Joshua, the business development executive, when contacted by Gulf News confirmed that there was a delay in this case but said it was not due to non-payment of bills.“We are trying to sort it out but the delay is not because we have not paid the bills. There is some internal problem and we are trying to solve it at the earliest. We are constantly in touch with our client and have assured him that his consignment will reach him soon,” said Joshua.
Case considered first in the UAE and the third published case worldwide, says hospitalAhmad Al Mansouri with his baby. The congenital malformation of the intestine led to perforation of the small bowel, filling the baby’s whole abdomen with fluid. Courtesy: Danat Al Emarat HospitalAbu Dhabi: Surgeons in the capital have successfully treated an Emirati newborn suffering from a rare congenital malformation of the intestine, doctors said on Saturday.The case was diagnosed at the Foetal Medicine Unit of Danat Al Emarat Hospital, during the 34th week of gestation, and the baby was delivered a few days later due to progressive worsening in the unborn baby’s condition.The newborn’s rare case is considered the first in the UAE and the third published case worldwide, the hospital said.The condition led to perforation of the small bowel, filling his whole abdomen with fluid and was life-threatening and a four-hour urgent surgery was performed.Dr Raja Cingapagu, paediatric surgeon at Danat Al Emarat Hospital, who performed the surgery along with a surgical team from various specialities, said: “During the surgery, the defective bowel, which was 15cm long, was resected. The healthy bowels were reconnected to each other and the abdominal cavity was cleared.”Dr Cingapagu also revealed that the surgery was considered complex for a number of reasons, including the fact that the case was extremely rare, the baby was premature and there was so much fluid in his abdominal cavity. “This case is complex, rare, the first of its kind in the UAE and the third of its kind in the world according to medical references. The first case took place in 1979, and the second in 2005 in France,” he said.“A number of tests were done to the newborn to identify the reason for the increased accumulation of fluid in the abdomen and huge abdominal distension. However, various scans did not show the exact problem of the intestine as the abdominal was covered with fluid. An emergency surgery was decided, which lasted for four hours during which the birth defect was identified as an intestinal tubular duplication cyst 15cm long of the small bowel, which led to twisted bowel and perforation during the late gestational period leading to fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity,” he added.The baby’s father, Ahmad Saeed Al Mansouri, said he was delighted with the success of the surgery. “The medical team was able to diagnose my son’s case before birth and they are known for their competency. I did not consider having it performed abroad because it was a rare urgent case.”“The capabilities of our medical multidisciplinary team at Danat Al Emarat Hospital are evident in managing rare and complex cases. The newborn was treated in a timely manner in the hospital’s level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and Paediatric Surgery Department led by a team of internationally trained physicians,” said Mohammad Ali Al Shorafa Al Hammadi, CEO of United Eastern Medical Services.“The development of a comprehensive scope of medical services, including fetal medicine, paediatrics and neonatology, paediatric surgery along with an advanced neonatal intensive care unit led by an experienced medical team are all essential in caring for high-risk pregnancies, rare cases, sick newborns and premature babies,” he added.
Public Funds Prosecution refers accused to Criminal Court for embezzling Dh500,000Dubai: A high-ranking employee of Dubai Financial Market (DFM) has been charged with embezzling Dh500,000 from public funds and forging electronic official documents.The Public Funds Prosecution in Dubai has referred the accused to the Criminal Court.The suspect, who is of Asian origin, is accused of abusing his authority as DFM’s financial manager to profit from public funds after forging three cheques totalling nearly Dh2 million.Esmail Madani, Head of the Public Funds Prosecution, said the Public Prosecution referred the employee after investigations showed that the suspect embezzled Dh500,000 after encashing one of the three cheaques and diverting the amount to his own account.Madani said that the defendant sent a message via email to DFM’s Customer Service and asked them to send him three forms of cheques for each investor that are deposited in local bank accounts contracted by DFM.“The accused made the staff of the Customer Service believe that the procedure was a mere experiment and a security test of the system. Due to his post as DFM’s financial manager, they believed him and sent him blank cheques,” said Madani.He then put his name and the name of a former female employee of DFM as investors on financial statements and sent them to print, asking for three cheques bearing the logos of DFM, the investment company and the bank.Madani explained that the DFM printer sent the suspect three blank cheques, one of which he used to embezzle the amount.The suspect was questioned by Ahmad Murad Ahmad, chief public funds prosecutor, about the financial irregularities that he carried out by abusing his authority to steal public money.The accused will be tried according to the Federal Penal Code and its provisions related to combating cybercrimes.
The Gardens next to Jebel Ali. Dubai: Residents of the Gardens, a neighbourhood located next to Ibn Battuta Mall in Jebel Ali, were left without water on Saturday.Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (Dewa) said that technicians were working to restore the water line. It did not give any time frame.The community’s developer, Nakheel, said that its security staff had found a water leak at 3.15am on Saturday.The leak was seen near building 199, close to the district cooling plant, according to the Nakheel spokesperson.Nakheel has referred residents’ complaints through to Dewa.“It’s a Dewa issue as it’s a Dewa pipe,” she said.As of 5pm in the afternoon, the issue had still not been fixed.Shella Tolientimo, a Gardens resident, said that she had had no water in her apartment since the morning.Not all the residents of The Gardens, a low-rise neighbourhood made up of 209 buildings, were affected by the disruption.Shehnaz Ahmad, who lives in Building 76, said that her water was working as normal.While Nakheel is the sole developer of the Gardens, not all of the utilities appear to be linked, she said.“It’s very common in the Gardens, different buildings have different connections. Not everything is synchronised.”
Committee tasked to oversee managing foster families and abandoned children restructuredDubai: The Community Development Authority (CDA) in Dubai has issued a resolution to restructure the committee responsible for overseeing and setting up rules for families that foster children of unknown parentage in the emirate.The committee will be responsible for developing the necessary criteria for the selection of foster families through the Embrace programme and the establishment of an integrated record of all abandoned children in Dubai.The committee is also tasked to follow up children with foster families, in addition to the preparation and implementation of programmes to raise awareness among the community about the rights and laws of abandoned children.Khalid Al Kamda, CDA director-general, said: “Despite the low numbers of abandoned children in the country, the UAE leadership gave them lots of care and issued special laws to safeguard their rights and allow alternative care provided by foster families, which is supervised directly by the Community Development Authority.”“We expect this expansion of the foster families committee to include more active and influential personalities from different government agencies and institutions who are concerned about abandoned children. We hope this will help in developing and speeding up all the plans and programmes that aim to protect abandoned children’s rights plus helping foster families to solve all legal and social difficulties and raise the kids in the best way under the best conditions.”This committee is headed by Dr Abdul Aziz Al Hammadi, director of Family Cohesion Department at CDA, and includes Dr Afra Bin Zaal, director of the Preventive Medicine Department at the Ministry of Health and Prevention, as vice-president.Other officials from the Family Village at Awqaf and Minors Affairs, the General Department of Residency and Foreigners Affairs, the Families and Delinquent Children at Dubai Public Prosecution, the Domestic Reform Section in Dubai Courts, and Alternative Care Department at CDA make up the committee.Federal Law No (1) for the year 2012 ensures that abandoned children are taken care of by competent and established care homes and ensure the availability of foster families for them.
Dubai: A group of Emirati students have returned to the UAE after successfully completing a summer internship programme in nuclear technology in South Korea.Sponsored by Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (Enec), the programme offered 10 Emirati students hands-on experience and an insight into the nuclear industry.Enec offers these internships as the UAE builds its nuclear energy programme, with the construction of four nuclear power units.The construction of the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant commenced in 2012 and is progressing steadily. Unit 1 is now more than 90 per cent complete and overall construction of units 1 to 4 is now more than 68 per cent complete. All four units will deliver safe, clean, reliable and efficient nuclear energy to the UAE grid.As part of the internship programme held in partnership with the Kepco International Nuclear Graduate School (KINGS), the students from Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research (KUSTAR) and Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) studied at the KINGS campus in Ulsan this summer.The internship programme sought to nurture students’ academic knowledge while simultaneously providing them with experience in the form of on-the-job training.The students underwent a four-week Nuclear Power Familiarisation Course before commencing a two weeks on-the-job training at a variety of research facilities and institutions around South Korea.“Through our internship programmes, Enec is proud to be able to offer great opportunities for talented students to get out of the classroom and put theory into practice. Students were introduced to specialised, technical concepts and had a chance to enhance their skills and knowledge. Initiatives, such as this programme in Korea, put students on the path to becoming key players in the UAE’s future nuclear energy sector,” said Mohammad Al Hammadi, chief executive officer of Enec.Enec offers a wide range of scholarship-based training and development programmes for UAE nationals, which include undergraduate, postgraduate and vocational courses.
Sharjah: Sharjah Police will start imposing fines on establishments which fail to install security systems in their premises.The fines range between Dh2,000 and Dh20,000, depending on the type of the violation.Sharjah Police aim to protect vital establishments by installing an early alarm system that links it to the police operations room.The installation of a security system to help police and other security agencies enhance security services and prevent crimes is part of Sharjah Police’s ambitious project titled ‘Sharjah is a safe city’.The move comes in light of the decision of the executive Council No 28 of 2015 regarding securing vital establishments in Sharjah.The penalty will be doubled if the violation is repeated during a year from the date of the first violation.The authorities can take one or more measures against offending establishments and confiscate the equipment and devices prohibited by this resolution.

Reports say women are buying lice from beauty salons believing that lice help treat hair loss and make hair thickerImage Credit: SuppliedSome women’s hair salons in Dubai have reportedly started growing lice by collecting damaged hair and subjecting it to high temperatureDubai: Dubai Municipality has warned beauty and hair salons against selling lice as a treatment for hair loss.It has been noticed recently that women go to hair salons to buy lice believing that lice help treat hair loss and make hair thicker.Some women’s hair salons in Dubai started growing lice by collecting damaged hair and subjecting it to high temperature. Some women said the price of one louse is Dh14, a report in Arabic daily Emarat Al Youm stated on Saturday.The report quoted Hafez Ghalloum, head of the Health Control Section at Dubai Municipality, as saying the use of lice on hair is unhealthy and a harmful practice. The section carries our regular and surprise inspections on beauty centres and hair salons to ensure they do not violate health rules and regulations. Those found violating rules will be fined,” Ghalloum said.“We aim through inspections to see that no negative or harmful practices are committed by hair salons and beauty centres,” he added.Ghalloum said they are wondering how these salons grow lice that cause scalp damage and dangerous skin diseases. People usually go to salons seeking treatment to get rid of lice, not to buy it.Dr Sharif Diaa, a dermatologist at Obaid Allah Hospital in Ras Al Khaimah, warned against believing such false claims that are promoted on social media.“Head lice are small, wingless and blood-sucking insects. They live on head hair and feed on scalp blood. Head lice are contagious and spread quickly to others and cause severe itching and skin diseases. Treating lice and getting rid of it takes a long time,” Dr Diaa said.He advised women not to believe such rumours, warning that it will infect their families.
Deportation order becomes compulsory when a suspect commits a crime against someone’s privacy, honour or dignityThe LawArticle 121 of the amended Federal Penal Law No. 3, 1987, says it’s up to a judge’s discretion to order the deportation of any expatriate who is jailed for a crime or misdemeanour.A deportation order becomes compulsory when a suspect commits a crime against someone’s privacy, honour or dignity. According to the same Article, a court can instantly deport a suspect in a misdemeanour crime instead of a jail sentence.The fifth section of the same Law concerning crimes against honour and dignity, Article 358, stipulates that a suspect who commits an indecent gesture in public faces a minimum of six months in jail, and any suspect who breaches the privacy, honour or dignity of a minor under the age of 15, in public or in private, faces minimum one year in jail.Flashing a middle finger, scratching or touching one’s private parts in an unacceptable and indecent manner before others, urinating, exposing private parts, showing private parts to surveillance cameras, showing affection or exaggerated intimacy, having or being involved in any form of sexual activity in public (in any open place such as the beach, in a car, in a public toilet) or pecking someone’s cheek or kissing are acts that are, in most incidents, deemed as public indecency.Those who are charged with committing an indecent act in public are referred to the Dubai Misdemeanour Court. They could face between one month and a maximum of three years in prison. Yet punishment is often decided at the judge’s discretion.
Some incidents in which expatriates were deported from UAE for indecent gestures in public 2015: An American engineer was acquitted of flashing his middle finger to a Canadian businessman following an alleged road rage incident.The court cleared the American of indecently gesturing in public and dropped the charges against him for uncorroborated evidence.2014: A court convicted a Pakistani worker of flashing his middle finger to a 19-year-old jobless man, who was also convicted of flashing his finger to the worker.The court handed the Pakistani defendant a deportation order.When he defended himself in court, the Pakistani defendant said: “I am guilty for flashing my finger in his face... but I reacted to his and his compatriot’s behaviour.”2013: The Appeal Court upheld a one month prison term against a British national, who was convicted of flashing his middle finger at a police patrol in Dubai. He was also handed a deportation order.Public Prosecution accused the Briton of committing a lewd act in public.Records said one of the patrol members testified that they flashed the high beam to the Briton to give them way, but he failed to do so. A witness said when they overtook him, the defendant flashed his middle finger at the police patrol.2013:  A French engineer was handed a six-month suspended sentence for indecently gesturing in public in the faces of two plainclothed policemen while driving on Business Bay Bridge.He was deported immediately.It is worth mentioning that the engineer’s lawyer had argued before the court: “In Europe and Western countries, it’s an Anglo-Saxon habit that someone flashes his middle finger unlike in our culture… where it is an act punishable by law. The two cultures differ, whereby when someone flashes his finger in the West he/she has to raise his elbow then flip up his finger. In the West it is a normal reaction.”2012: the Dubai Misdemeanours Court convicted the 44-year-old Iranian woman of committing an indecent gesture in public although she had claimed that she only bit her nails and had not flashed her middle finger.The court also fined her Dh3,000 for consuming liquor.The businesswoman flashed her finger at the Emirati policemen shortly after dining out with her friends in Palm Jumeirah.She had pleaded innocent claiming that she bit her nails and scratched her finger due to a skin disease that she suffers from when the policemen “confusingly thought she flashed her finger in their face”.2011: A British laparoscopic surgeon was cleared of indecently gesturing in public and flashing his middle in the face of an Emirati official following a road rage incident.2010:  The Misdemeanours Court jailed a pilot, who flashed his middle finger at a policeman in an instance of road rage, for one month. He was also handed a deportation.The defendant denied the charge and maintained that he flashed at the victim wanting to say ‘easy easy’.
Rs7.5m in total announced for P.V. Sindhu and Sakshi MalikDubai: An Indian businessman in Dubai has announced a total of Rs7.5 million (Dh410,305) as a cash prize to the Indian sports stars who won medals at the Rio Olympics.A UAE resident for four decades, Mukkattu Sebastian, who runs the Autobahn Car Rental network, announced Rs5 million to badminton star P.V. Sindhu who grabbed a silver medal and became the first Indian woman to win that honour at an Olympic game on Friday.He also announced Rs2.5 million for Sakshi Malik, who won a bronze in wrestling, the first medal for India at the Rio Games 2016.“These two girls saved the face of India at Rio. I am so proud of them and wanted to honour them with a cash award,” Sebastian told Gulf News on Saturday.“Everybody is after cricketers in India. Nobody minds other sports stars. After their glorious win, I strongly felt I needed to honour them. They cannot sustain [themselves] just with medals. So, I am giving what I can. I am not a very rich person. But I want to do whatever I can,” said Sebastian, who also owns Mukkadan Plantations in Kerala and Autobahn Car Rentals in Bengaluru.Sebastian said he had kept Rs10 million as the cash prize for gold medallists and had hoped Sindhu would win gold.He said he was not disappointed that Sindhu got a silver because hers was a narrow defeat to world champion Spain’s Carolina Marin. He also admire Malik for “fighting like a tigress” to get India’s first medal at this Olympics.Hailing from Kottayam district in Kerala, Sebastian said he plans to host a function in Kochi to honour the Olympic medallists who made a country of 1.25 billion people proud.“I have already written to the Olympic committee of India to help coordinate this and fix a date for the function. I have also informed the state sports authority in Kerala about the plan.”He said he would also request the Olympic committee to recommend to the finance minister a tax exemption for the prize money. “Otherwise, they will have to pay 30 per cent of the prize money as tax,” Sebastian pointed out.He said he was ready to offer similar cash awards to any Indian who wins a medal at Rio.“If anybody wins a gold medal for India, I would like to give one crore rupees (Rs10 million). If it is silver, I will give Rs5 million and for bronze Rs2.5 million,” said Sebastian, adding that he is also willing to support sporting champions who are financially backward.To motivate budding sports talents in the state, he said, all school students who took part in the Kerala State Sports and Games event last time will be invited to attend the honouring ceremony for the Olympic winners.Other Indian expats in the UAE have also joined their compatriots back home in celebrating the victory of the two young women who pulled the nation out of the Games gloom. Many took to social media to congratulate the stars and express their happiness and pride.         
Dubai: Getting angry and picking a fight in a situation where your emotions get the better of you is not an uncommon predicament for people. For example, being wrongly overtaken on the road or forced to cut back in a supermarket queue can often make an individual see red.And if in this state of anger, the person flashes his or her middle finger at another in public, they have crossed the line. This offence will get them deported.As per the Federal Penal Law, deportation has been compulsory against those found guilty of flashing their middle finger in public for several years now.Many cases have surfaced across the UAE courts, and continue to do so.Gulf News spoke to a cross section of judicial entities on this aspect and they have recommended that deportation orders be discretionary in crimes related to dignity and honour in the UAE Penal Code.Judges, lawyers and judicial bodies have recommended a list of amendments to be introduced to the pertinent law.A cross-section of lawyers and judges have called for making the deportation order optional and not compulsory anymore in crimes related to public indecency and breach of modesty and honour.However, they recommended that deportation remains compulsory in major crimes such as rape and molestation.What judges sayChief judge Ali Attiyah Sa’ad, a presiding judge at a Dubai Misdemeanours Court bench“Unless legislators introduce new amendments to the Penal Laws ... deportation will remain obligatory and inevitable”Chief judge Sa’ad says flashing the middle finger in public is an act punishable by the Penal Law that also obligates the presiding judge to hand out a deportation order against the defendant, once incriminated.“A deportation order is mandatory and inevitable unless the suspect is pronounced innocent,” he told Gulf News.Deliberating further, chief judge Sa’ad said flashing a middle finger, as per the aforementioned law, is considered ‘an indecent gesture in pubic and a crime related to breaching a victim’s pride, privacy and/or modesty’.“Defendants, who are convicted in sex-related crimes, cannot avoid deportation and the law does not provide the judge with the discretion or option [on handing out a deportation order] … unlike in other crimes. Once a defendant is found guilty, it becomes mandatory to the judge to order that the convict be deported. It is true that flashing a middle finger is not a sex-related crime, but it is deemed as a crime that [impacts] on a victim’s pride and honour. Such crimes are treated with high vigilance due to its awfulness,” he explained.The cassation and supreme courts in the UAE handed out several precedents and landmark rulings in which any form of public indecency — including the act of flashing a middle finger — has been considered and is treated as a crime of breaching a victim’s pride, honour and modesty.“Since then, legislators amended the law and made it mandatory to a hand out a deportation order against the guilty. Unless legislators introduce new amendments to the Penal Laws, hence enabling judges with the discretion, things will remain the same … deportation will remain obligatory and inevitable,” he added.Is flashing a middle finger in public a ‘serious and appalling crime’ that deserves deportation of the convicted?Chief judge Sa’ad: “This issue depends on how and why the crime happened and the parties involved. Every criminal incident has its independent circumstances, different evidence and different involved parties. For instance, such a crime might happen between two men who indulge in a heated argument and one party flashes his middle finger to the other … this is not a very dreadful crime. Meanwhile, if a man flashes his middle finger to a woman, then this is an awful and terrible crime. Those are just two simple examples on the matter of how each crime should be treated differently … or in simple judicial language, each crime is treated individualistically. However, currently and as per the context of the law, deportation is mandatory in such crimes.”Should the law be amended [to grant judges the discretion to deport or not a guilty defendant] on humanitarian grounds?Chief judge Sa’ad: “Yes … because not all cases involving suspects, who flash the middle finger, are considered awful crimes. In several cases, there have been incidents involving suspects who flashed their finger under certain circumstances that could be deemed as a crime … but not a dreadful one. Let me give you an example. There have been cases in which an immoral behaviour [and not only flashing a middle finger] was committed … sometimes, judges hand out suspended imprisonments. Yet in those cases, the judge was obligated [by the power the law] to hand out a deportation order against those convicts. It is true that a judge suspended the punishment on leniency grounds, but the judge was still obligated to hand out a deportation against guilty defendants. To be honest, in such incidents, the deportation order is stricter and has a harsher impact than the suspended punishment itself. Hence, it would be more appropriate to suspend the deportation as well. That is mainly why I believe judges should be granted the discretion to decide when and whether a guilty defendant must be deported or not.”What if someone flashed a middle finger in a closed place [not in public such as in a room or an office] in the presence of another witness? Would such behaviour be deemed as an indecent gesturing in public?Chief judge Sa’ad: “Generally speaking, the law has granted judges the discretion to observe the act of incrimination and punishment. Each crime should be treated independently because no two crimes are alike. To reiterate, every single crime has different circumstances and evidence … and that is mainly and generally speaking why the punishment is always based on the judge’s discretion. Legislators have granted the judge the discretion on how and when to treat the defendant with leniency or not … we cannot set a certain crime [although not two crimes are alike] as a precedent and judge accordingly. That is why, when a judge studies the case file and evidence brought against a suspect, the judge builds up a certain belief and hands out the punishment deemed suitable.”Senior chief appeal judge at Dubai Courts“Deportation order should become optional to a judge due to humanitarian, social and emotional grounds ...”“The compulsory deportation order has honestly kept a tight rein on us especially when we prosecute someone who committed an indecent gesture in public such as flashing a finger. The suspects who commit such an offence or crime aren’t a threat to society or as dangerous as rapists or molesters who deserve a deportation order.“I would like to justify the recommendation to amend the Penal Law and make the deportation order discretionary due to many difficulties and complications that resulted since it became obligatory. Mainly, the deportation order should become optional to a judge due to humanitarian, social and emotional grounds … and sometimes educational and financial grounds.Case studyA case in point was that of a company’s general manager, who indulged in a heated argument following a road rage incident, the judge said. The man flashed his middle finger in the face of the victim, who lodged a criminal case against the general manager. The latter was tried before the Dubai Misdemeanours Court and was sentenced to a month in jail followed by deportation. The defendant appealed the primary verdict and it happened that I was the presiding judge of the appellate court that handled the case. The defendant sought leniency and asked the court to cancel his deportation order … but unfortunately, nothing could be done.“As per the Penal Law, the court was obligated to uphold the deportation order. It cannot be cancelled. The matter did not end there. His wife visited me at my office and begged me to do something … she cried and beseeched to reconsider. She even suggested that her husband spend a lengthy jail term but to cancel the deportation. The wife said that her husband sponsors her and their children, who are students … and that if her husband gets deported, then the family’s future would be ruined. Haplessly, nothing could be done and the family cancelled their residencies and left the country. The only thing that I, as a judge, did was suspend the husband’s imprisonment. That was just a slight example on why I call on legislators to reconsider this matter.”Cassation judge“I call on the lawmakers to reconsider the matter ...”Judges are obligated to issue deportation orders against expatriate convicts even though cases were dropped and/or complainants had waived their complaints, the cassation judge said.“Nevertheless, residents should have better control over their behaviour in public because, according to the Federal Penal Law, deportation is obligatory against those who are incriminated of committing an indecent gesture in public such as flashing their middle finger, kissing, cuddling or hugging. However, I do call on legislators to amend the current laws and grant the judge with the discretion to decide whether or not a convict deserves to be deported. We are the number one defenders of law and justice before the society. The current law binds us to deport any suspect who is convicted of committing public indecency. I am not calling for a complete cancellation for the deportation order, but before the 2005 amendments, the judge had the discretion to issue a deportation order, and I call on the lawmakers to reconsider the matter and grant the discretion to the judge.”What lawyers sayA cross-section of lawyers, whom Gulf News interviewed, shared the judges’ opinion and urged legislators to stipulate amendments to the Penal Law granting judges the discretion to decide on deportation orders.Dr Reyadh Al Kabban, Al Kabban and Associates Advocates and Legal Consultants“In 2011, the Dubai Court of Cassation ruled that foreigners who flaunt their middle finger to others must be deported from the UAE for ‘committing indecent acts’ as per articles 121 and 358 of the Penal Code. This shows the conflicting battle between the traditional viewpoints and the evident modernity in the UAE. Such minor offences have proven to be burdensome, as this sort of claim costs the legal system a hefty sum of money that could be spent elsewhere. The progressions that have occurred in the UAE in the last 10-15 years, call for an update and organisation of the law to accommodate the change of the UAE to an international business hub,” he said.There is an evident discrepancy between the offences committed, according to Dr Al Kabban, and the severity of the punishment, where those committing more serious crimes that affect the country’s economy get away with a few months in prison without deportation.“Therefore, in relation to the compulsory deportation of expatriates committing such crimes classified as indecent acts, pursuant to articles 121 and 358 of the Penal Code, I recommend that the court judges be granted the authority to decide whether the circumstances and facts of the case justify the deportation of the accused or not,” he concluded.Advocate Yousuf Al Bahar“I am with the party who would vote for the amendment of concerned article of law to empower/authorise the judge to have the full freedom to impose or not to impose the deportation order ... in cases relate to insulting gesture … Because the UAE society (whether Emiratis or expatriates) are aware that UAE is a Muslim country that has unique traditions and culture based on respect, human dignities and morals. These principles are considered as general policy of Laws as per article (7, 30 and 44) of the UAE Constitution and article no 3 of Civil Transactions Laws as well as article 1 of the UAE Penal Code.”Being an expatriate, one should obey and respect the general law, cultures and beliefs, he said.“The act of flicking the middle finger is considered an offensive act that hurts the dignity of others whether he/she is Emirati or expatriate. Such act also violates the common principle of morals and respect society is based on. Though I am aware that deportation punishment may affect the defendant’s life as well as that of his/her family … I believe that individuals should, firstly, be aware that he/she has a family to take care of and that they live in a society which believes that everyone has dignity to protect and has the right to live in a civilised society where respect is mutual.”Advocate Mansour Al Mazmi, Bin Mes’har and Co Advocates and Legal Consultants“The legal text should be smoother so the judge can estimate how the circumstances of the incident [flashing the middle finger] happened and according to that the judge decides either to deport the criminal from the country or not.”Advocate Abdullah Al Nasser, of Araa Advocates and Legal Consultants“I agree that a judge should be granted the discretion whether a suspect, who flicks the middle finger in public, should be deported or not. A judge is the voice of the law and is granted this empowerment by the law itself to instil justness and fairness and maintain social balance.”Previous criminal judge and current advocate Khalifa Al Salman“I am strongly against the compulsory deportation order because it is very stiff against someone who commits an indecent gesture or behaves obscenely in public. “A deportation order is meant to expel a suspect from society when he/she becomes more harmful than beneficial to society.”He called on lawmakers to stipulate laws that entitle judges to jail or fine a suspect who commits such a crime and grant them the discretion to issue deportation orders or not against expatriates.“It is fair to say that a punishment shouldn’t be unified but rather be relevant to the severity of the crime.”

Suspects smuggled ‘huge number’ of stolen vehicles out of countryNetwork targeted four wheel drive and smuggled  them out of country.Image credit: Sharjah PoliceSharjah: Two members of a gang which allegedly stole a “huge number” of vehicles and smuggled them out of the country have been arrested, police said on Saturday.A senior official at the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) at Sharjah Police said the gang had members operating inside and out of the country. The vehicles were stolen from individuals and companies in the country, the official said without specifying the total number of vehicles involved.The arrested suspects are Pakistani.The police had launched an investigation after they received a number of complaints from car owners.The gang targeted only four-wheel drives, the official said.A police team identified one suspect and raided his hideout and seized tools used by the suspects.The suspect admitted his role in the thefts and led police to his partners.The two revealed to the police how they carried out the thefts. They broke into the cars by opening the window and tampered with the ignition before driving the stolen vehicles to Al Ain.The stolen vehicles were then smuggled outside the country in coordination with another suspect who lives in a neighbouring country. The latter sent someone to pick up the stolen vehicle. He paid to the two suspects either immediately or transferred money through a money exchange.The police are now hunting the suspects who are outside the country.The case has been referred to Sharjah Public Prosecution.Sharjah Police urged all community members not to leave their vehicles in deserted or poorly lit places.
Al Qasimi Hospital. Expat’s father’s body was not allowed to be flown to Goa, India from Sharjah after the embalming had been done in Dubai.Dubai: An Indian man has described the mental anguish and financial loss he had to endure when his father’s body was not allowed to be flown from Sharjah after the embalming had been done in Dubai.JP, who does not wish to reveal his full name, told Gulf News that he was shocked when Dubai Municipality officials denied him permission to fly his father’s body from Sharjah when he went for approval for embalming the body.“My dad suffered a stroke and died on a Thursday in May at Al Qasimi Hospital in Sharjah. We couldn’t do any paper work over the weekend. After doing all the cumbersome documentations to fly his body from Sharjah, we went to Dubai for arranging the embalming. By then, it was already five days after my dad passed away,” he recalled.JP said he had booked tickets for him and his cousin with Air Arabia and also paid for the cargo to transport his father’s body.“Then we went to schedule the embalming at Muhaisnah. Then the municipality officials said, no, you cannot take the body from Sharjah... I was shocked! I explained my case and requested them. But, they showed a notice and said they are just obeying the rule.”JP said he went to Dubai Police and Dubai Municipality’s headquarters. “I tried my best to travel on the booked flight. The cops said they don’t have any problem in me taking the body from Dubai. Even the employees who attended to me at the municipality were shocked initially. But, when they rang up the Muhaisnah office, they were also told that nothing can be done as it is a rule.”JP said he lost over Dh3,000 as they could not travel on the flight from Sharjah to Goa on which they had already booked tickets. He then had to do the whole documentation for repatriation again in Dubai, which took another two days for completion.According to JP, his father’s body was brought from Sharjah to Muhaisnah in a Sharjah ambulance for free while Dubai Municipality charged for the service of transferring the body from Muhaisnah to Dubai Airport.“We also had to inform the Indian authorities about the arrival of the body so that they could arrange a doctor to issue the death certificate over there. Our case was very famous in Goa as they had to wait for two-three days for us. We had to resend the documents to them before we finally managed to fly from Dubai.“It was a big issue. We were already stressed out a lot. During the emotional trauma, we had to take all this additional stress. Thankfully, my company was so cooperative and understanding. All companies need not be so and some people might face issues with their companies too in such circumstances,” he said.JP said that the funny part which he realised from the experience was “you can fly from any emirate when you are alive… but you can’t do that when you are dead.”“I wish the authorities will either change this rule or at least inform the applicants when we process the repatriation documents about this clause. Then people can at least know what to do to avoid such situations,” he added.
Dubai: A Tunisian man was accused of impersonating a police officer and threatening to jail and deport two men for allegedly using drugs and taking their money to let them go.According to the charge sheet, the suspect, H.B.A., 30, was also accused of stealing more money and one of the victim’s ID cards when he was pretending to search their car for drugs.The Dubai Public Prosecution ordered that his case be transferred to the Criminal Court to stand trial.According to one of the victim’s statements, H.B.A. stopped them when they were in a car in a parking lot in Al Rifa’a area at around 2am.“He told us he was from CID [Criminal investigation Department – undercover police] and asked us why we were in the car. He then said that he had received information that we were using drugs and he started raising his shoulder towards his face as if speaking into a communication device in both English and Arabic,” one of the victims, A.A.K., 24, an Indian, said in his statement.The suspect asked the two men to leave all their belongings in the car and stand against a nearby wall with their hands raised, A.A.K. said.The suspect frisked the two men, and then pretended to search the car for drugs. The men were still facing the car and could not see what he was doing.“He came back with a strip of pills, claiming it was in the car and said that the punishment for using drugs was a life sentence followed by deportation. He then asked us to pay Dh2,500 that he said he would give to charity to let us go,” he said.The victims drove to a nearby bank where they withdrew the amount and gave it to the officer, who A.A.K. said asked them to drive back home without stopping as he said he would know if they did using a GPS.The victims said they did as he asked, and when they reached home they realised the man had stolen a total of Dh7,000 from both their wallets in addition to the other victim’s Emirates ID.A.A.K. claimed that they had not had any alcohol or anything illegal on the day of the incident.The suspect was arrested after the two victims — who had already reported the incident to the police — saw him in a supermarket in Al Rifa’a area and alerted the authorities.One of the police officers, who worked on the case, said in his statement to the Public Prosecution that the suspect confessed to the crime.Police found Dh500 on the suspect’s person, which he said was what was left of the money he stole, as he sent some of the money to his father and spent the rest on hotels.The suspect will remain in custody until his trial.
Dubai Municipality’s new rule to transport bodies of deceased expats only to Dubai airport leading to issues, say social workersDubai: Bodies of expatriates embalmed in Dubai are no longer offered an ambulance transport service to airports in other emirates, leading to delays in the repatriation process, social workers said.Dubai Municipality has stopped inter-emirate transfer facility for expats’ bodies. The cemetery services section in Al Ghusais is no longer providing ambulance service to transport expats’ mortal remains to airports in other emirates.The change in rule has mainly affected Dubai, Sharjah, Umm Al Quwain and Fujairah, said Ashraf Thamarassery, a Dubai-based social worker and businessman who has been honoured by the Indian government for his selfless service in repatriating thousands of deceased expats.“All these emirates depend on the DHA (Dubai Health Authority) facility in Al Muhaisnah for embalming of the bodies,” he said. These emirates don’t have an embalming facility.“Dubai Municipality’s ambulance is used for transporting the bodies to the airport after embalming. Now, the service is only to Dubai airport.”The Dubai Municipality’s ambulance service to transport the bodies to other emirates was stopped almost a year ago. Social workers said they had earlier this year helped families to transport the bodies to Sharjah airport with the help of ambulances from Sharjah Municipality and Dubai Police after giving special requests. However, they claimed they were not allowed to use Sharjah Municipality’s ambulance to take the bodies back after embalming since the past few months.In effect, this means, that the body has to be repatriated only from Dubai airport because medically equipped ambulances from DHA or private hospitals cannot be used for transporting embalmed bodies. Since the Dubai Muncipality ambulance is the only means of transport, it means the body can only be repatriated from Dubai airport.Due to this restriction, Thamarassery said, expatriates are facing several difficulties. There could be no direct flight to the deceased’s hometown from Dubai and sometimes there is no space available for cargo or no ticket for the person accompanying the body or the tickets are costlier (for the deceased’s relatives) from Dubai, he said explaining why expats repatriate from other airports.No such inter-emirate transport restrictions affects repatriation of bodies embalmed in Abu Dhabi, Al Ain or Ras Al Khaimah, Thamarassery said.“There are several instances when people want to fly the bodies from Sharjah. You can bring the bodies embalmed in Abu Dhabi to Sharjah, but not from Dubai. And the Sharjah Municipality’s ambulance also cannot transfer the body from Dubai,” he said.Free service in other emiratesAshraf said the Sharjah Municipality officials had agreed to send an ambulance to pick up embalmed bodies from Dubai after the issue was taken up with officials there. However, Sharjah ambulances are not allowed to transport bodies from Dubai. “Sharjah Municipality is providing the service for free whereas Dubai Municipality charges Dh220 for the ambulance transport.”No other municipality or police departments are charging for the transportation of the bodies, according to Thamaraserry.The only other authority which comes to the rescue of distressed relatives at such times is Dubai Police, he said.“But it is not primarily their job and it is not possible for them to do it every time,” he added, requesting the Dubai Municipality to reconsider its decision.“All must be equal at least when they are dead…The rules should be even more relaxed in death cases,” he said.Echoing his views, another Indian social worker, C.P. Mathew, said he has personally seen how expats face difficulties in repatriation if they couldn’t fly to an airport close to their homes.“Sometimes people have to wait for several hours for a connecting flight. Sometimes, they have to travel 10 to 12 hours via road,” said Mathew, who has escorted several bodies to India.“Sometimes there is a difference of thousands of dirhams between the fares of budget carriers from Sharjah and airlines flying from Dubai. When ticket fares are costlier [from Dubai], people would want to opt for cheaper flights from Sharjah.” The new rule makes it difficult for people to do that now, particularly for those who are financially constrained, he said. Dubai Municipality responseWhen contacted, Dr Zuhoor Al Sabbagh, director of the Public Health Services Department, Dubai Municipality which manages the cemetery facility and ambulance services for the deceased, confirmed the implementation of the change in the rule.“Our duty is to transfer bodies anywhere in Dubai and within Dubai. At embalming, the DHA and police are responsible [if the body is being transferred from a police morgue, the police are responsible for transferring the body to the embalming centre and if it is coming from a hospital the DHA is responsible]. The delay is not from our side. We have no information about the delays as we have performance indicators measuring the time to transport bodies,” she said in a written reply to Gulf News.
Dubai: The Dubai Criminal Court acquitted a Pakistani mother and four other men, who were accused of forcing two teenage girls — the woman’s daughters — into sexual activities at a massage centre.They were acquitted because of lack of evidence, the court document stated.The 37-year-old Pakistani mother, S.K., was accused of luring her two daughters, both under 16, to the UAE and forcing them work as masseuses at the massage centre. She was also accused of coercing them to work as prostitutes in May 2014 and June this year.The 41-year-old Pakistani spa manager, identified as Z.M., was accused of helping the woman.The alleged illegal activity was discovered by a labour inspector who was on a routine inspection. He found that a 15-year-old Pakistani girl, one of S.K.’s daughters, was hired as a masseuse in Al Karama.The inspector reported the matter to the police before further investigations revealed the involvement of three other Pakistani suspects.Prosecutors accused S.K., Z.M., and their three countrymen — O.M., a hairdresser, M.A., an office boy, and F.A., a clerk — of human trafficking.O.M., M.A. and F.A. denied the charges when they appeared before the Dubai Court of First Instance on March 14.The mother and the spa manager were tried in absentia.The prosecutors said the five suspects took advantage of the girl’s young age and flew her from Pakistan to Dubai after her mother convinced her that she would allow her to continue her education in the UAE.The Pakistani teenager told the prosecutors that the incident happened after her father divorced her mother and the latter married an 18-year-old man. The girl said she and her sister were coerced to provide indecent services and massage men against their will in 2014.“We were beaten, scolded and forced to do an indecent job … Then one of the suspects raped my sister and impregnated her, so my mother took us back to Pakistan to avoid any legal trouble. Then she brought me back here in 2015 and forced me into the same job after she and Z.M. threatened to bring my younger sisters to do the same thing. I tried to run away but I could not because they constantly kept me under observation. One of them also took away my phone when I tried to call the police,” she told the prosecutors in March.
Entertainment events, cool deals and family fun highlighted 19th editionDubai: The 19th edition of largest and longest summer extravaganza in the region, Dubai Summer Surprises (DSS), concludes on Saturday after a 43-day city-wide celebration.The summer festival organised by the Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment (DFRE), an agency of the Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing (Dubai Tourism), offered residents and visitors promotions, world-class entertainment and rewarding experiences since it kicked off on July 9 under the theme ‘Own The Summer’.DSS 2016 featured a line-up of events and activities including shows by world famous cartoon characters, activations featuring global brands and products, and dining and shopping promotions, offering prizes.With numerous retail promotions offering prizes, including one offering shoppers the chance to win 12 Infiniti Q50 cars, and deals and discounts up to 75 per cent on an array of merchandise in malls citywide, DSS contributed towards boosting the city’s retail sector this summer season, organisers said.On the entertainment front, the DSS 2016  highlights included The Gruffalo Adventure and Save Our Summer at The Dubai Mall; Alvin & The Chipmunks Live on Stage at Mall of the Emirates, City Centre Mirdif and City Centre Deira; Mercado Circus Fiesta at Mercato; ‘Barbie You Can Be An Athlete’ experience, Trash Pack Live Show and Workshop, and Hasbro Games, all at Dragon Mart 2;  Miss Fortune Circus; Lego Friends Workshops and My Little Pony Live Show & Beauty Corner, all at Ibn Battuta Mall; Bricks at BOXPARK; The Jungle Book at CITY WALK; and Angry Birds: Splat That! at Dubai Festival City Mall.
Abu Dhabi: A total of Dh3 million is being allocated for research projects by Abu Dhabi University (ADU), with the research including plans to create more sustainable and energy friendly buildings that draw energy from the sun.The research projects come as part of a wider strategy by ADU, which is to establish itself as one of the region’s premier research-led universities, especially in the fields of sustainability and smart cities, which are also in line with Abu Dhabi’s 2020 and 2030 vision.“At ADU we strongly believe in research as a way of attracting well-qualified faculty and at the same providing the infrastructure that is highly supportive of the economic development in the UAE and the region as a whole,” said Dr Nabeel Ebrahim, Chancellor of ADU.Elaborating on the funded research projects, Dr Ebrahim explained that they are centered on future smart cities.“There are three main areas we are concentrating on – sustainable built environments, sustainable and viable businesses, and smart services and cities,” he said.“In terms of designing and developing new building structures, we have projects that are studying how to use the sun as a source of energy for these buildings, and so our researchers are creating devices that will draw on the sun’s energy for these purposes.“These innovative methods will reduce the dependency on more costly and less environmentally clean energy resources, and it will encourage the use of more non traditional sources of energy,” he added.Dr Ebrahim said that the research projects have already created opportunities for international partnerships with world-class universities from around the world.“Our researchers publish their findings and work in many different international journals, which sometimes attract partnerships with other recognised and well established universities. So we manage to receive a lot of international recognition as a research-intensive university,” he said.Dr Ebrahim also spoke on the positive significance of having an Arab university that supports world class research projects that can have a big impact on society.“Most of the best universities in the world pay a lot of attention towards research projects because it is considered to be an investment for the future that usually has a very good return. So it is an advantage to have such a university in the Middle East especially with the many challenges that it is currently facing,” he said.“If we want to solve the problems that are happening in the region there needs to be universities that are committed to the development and progress of the Middle East, and there also needs to be real projects that come up with relevant ideas and solutions for the community,” he added.
New school year to start on August 28 for all pupils across the emirateAbu Dhabi: A total of 15,235 public school teachers and administrators will resume their duties on August 20 in preparation for the 2016-2017 academic year, the Abu Dhabi Education Council (Adec) announced in a statement.The school year will begin for all pupils across the emirate on August 28, the statement from the emirate’s education sector regulator added.Before starting their preparations, public school teachers also attended professional development workshops where they were briefed on some of the upcoming activities for the year. More than 600 newly hired teachers were also invited to attend an orientation session where they were familiarised with Adec’s vision, cultural expectations and strategies.
Dubai: More than 7,000 unlicensed transport offences were recorded over six months in Dubai, according to the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA).The RTA has been trying to curb unlicensed transport activity in Dubai through a campaign called Saher Dubai in collaboration with Dubai Police.Abdullah Al Mahri, Director of Transport Activities and Monitoring Department, which is carrying out the 8th edition of the campaign, said the total number of violations recorded during the first half of the year amounted to 7,126 offences.“The RTA does not seek to collect fines against offenders, but rather focuses on curbing negative practices of public transport, intensifying the monitoring of violators in Dubai, and reducing the number of complaints relating to this practice. Slapping offences is only one of the means adopted in the aftermath of awareness campaigns to uproot this negative practice,” Al Mahri said.The campaign is part of RTA’s efforts to curb this illegal activity, which is mushrooming in a way that warrants concerted efforts to stem its negative impact on the RTA and the community at large, he said.Unlicensed transport activity rarely takes place by the roadside but those providing the clandestine services and those using them operate at specific locations, though the locations keep changing to evade detection, said Al Mahri.It is difficult to quantify the extent of such operations as it is involves the use of different types of vehicles including private cars, rented cars, commercial transport vehicles, and company cars, he added.“While this practice recedes under the intensive enforcement and hefty fine measures, newcomers are engaged, while some frequent violators do come again following a short spell. Some of these are ex-taxi-drivers who, after the taxi businesses have been regularised in other emirates, had to convert their cabs into private vehicles and opted to implicate them into such unlicensed passenger transport activities in Dubai,” he explained.As for the losses caused by such unlawful activity for the taxi sector in Dubai, Al Mahri said this practice has negative financial implications on this vital sector in Dubai, which is considered one of the key tourist destinations in the region.“It distorts the profile of the RTA as a service-providing entity that seeks to deliver best services through creative techniques aligned with the world’s top practices and solutions of the industry. This activity is an uncivilised phenomenon in sharp contrast with the status and repute of Dubai as a regional business and economic hub; besides that it unravels RTA’s efforts and keenness to broaden and upgrade the transportation sector, let alone the substantial damage inflicted by this activity on the service, tourist, and social sectors among other key sectors,” Al Mahri added.The 8th edition of the Saher campaign involves a total of 76 individuals divided into five site teams, he said. What the law saysThe Executive Council in Dubai issued a resolution regulating road transport for people anywhere in the emirate.The resolution prohibits transporting passengers on vehicles not licensed for such activity in return for financial return, be it within Dubai or from Dubai to any other emirate.The resolution also prohibits providing passenger transport service through phone calls, online, smart apps or other means before seeking approval from the Public Transport Agency.The resolution prohibits promoting taxi services on unlicensed vehicles or announcing the offering of this service by hailing individuals or any other means. It also prohibits transporting passengers on taxicabs without switching on the meter at the start of each trip.
Abu Dhabi: A group of environmentalists are hoping to raise awareness about the UAE’s unique natural history through their community group, which organises regular camping trips and lectures to shed light on the subject.Originally founded in 1977, the Emirates Natural History Group (ENHG) was set up by expatriates who wanted to record and share their findings on the natural bounty of the UAE, which include types of animal species they encountered, and different types of bird migrations.“This is definitely a great community group for people who are interested in learning and discovering the UAE’s natural history because there is so much out there to explore,” said Arabella Willing, a marine biologist and chair of the ENHG’s committee.“I would say that the UAE’s environment is quite underappreciated for what it has to offer. Environmentally speaking, the UAE is a very hot place and so the creatures that live here are really fascinating and unique because they are able to survive and adapt in such extreme conditions. The corals in the sea, for example, are able to survive at temperatures that are not possible for corals around the world, and so that makes them very unique,” she added.Willing explained that members who join the group are invited to take part in camping trips in the UAE.“There are many different kinds of camping trips, some will last for around four to five days in the desert, while another can just be for the afternoon on a boat — for bird watching; We try to always have some experts on the camping trips as well so that the members who do come along can learn something from the experience,” she said.“As well as the camping trips, we hold two lectures every month that are led by experts discussing a range of topics related to the environment of the UAE and the region. Some of these talks have been on the archaeology and fossil records of the UAE, things that many people might not be aware about,” she added.The community-led group is also involved in supporting research projects, according to Willing.“The group awards grants for research that is being done about the natural environment in the region. One initiative that we have supported was to help with providing satellite tags for a whale shark project. Another one was something as simple as giving binoculars to help with a dolphin survey that is being carried out,” she said.Willing also said that having a group that aims to raise awareness and education on the environment helps with an even bigger and more important cause — environmental protection.“Having members of the community contributing their efforts and knowledge about the environment is obviously beneficial. It’s kind of like citizen science, which is something we need. The more people from society you can get involved then the better because it can work towards protecting our environment,” she said.  How to sign up?Members of the public can become a member and get all information on future events and lectures from the ENHG’s main website: http://abudhabi.enhg.org
Grand Winner Eyzell and Joy Salinel (centre) celebrate their winning song. Flanking them are 2nd Placer Bernardo Granado (far right), Consul General Paul Raymund Cortes (fifth from left) and Dr Yasmin Cortes (fifth from right), along with the other winners of the Dubai, Dubai Musikahan competition. Dubai: More than 500 members of the Filipino community in the UAE attended a musical extravaganza held on Friday to commemorate the National Language Month of the Philippines.The first of its kind event to be organised by a Philippines Consulate General was held at the Asiana Hotel in Dubai and saw 12 finalists of a song-writing competition perform in their native language for a rapt audience. The event showcased the diverse creative talents of the community.Paul Raymund Cortes, the Consul General of the Philippines in the UAE, attended the event.The National Language Month is celebrated every August by the Philippines, a country with over 70 languages and dialects, of which Filipino is predominant.“We wanted to come up with a competition, in as much as the Philippines has been known for or reputed to be, a global musician, one who is able to sing, dance, perform and write music. Knowing that in Dubai and Northern Emirates there aren’t too many avenues for Filipinos to express their creativity here, we decided to organise an event which showcases the global repute of the Filipino,” Cortes said.The Consul General observed that the Philippines is a melting pot of languages, with 13 languages spoken by at least one million people each.“It’s a sizable linguistic society we have in the Philippines and the National Language Month is a celebration to make everyone aware of that. Now when you juxtapose the music and the language together, you have something like this event called Dubai, Dubai Musikahan, which means musical spectacle,” he said.Cortes added that the aim of such activities was to encourage Filipinos to unleash their innate creativity, whether it was through song-writing, dance, or performing other arts.There were 40 submissions to the song-writing competition with the theme of national unity for progress, Cortes said. “Filipinos were able to write their songs in their native languages.“We are encouraging Filipinos to be more confident of themselves and aware that they are able to contribute in many ways. They have played a role in the success of the UAE economy. Dubai is now the centre of aviation, trade finance, tourism and art, and Filipinos have played a role in that, which is something we should be very proud of.”The event was open to people of other nationalities as well and entry was free and featured Filipino artists, dancers and choirs besides other performers.Three winners of the song-writing competition were announced at the end of the event and received cash prizes besides winning for themselves free tours of the Philippines.“The Philippines Consulate General and Filipino Ladies in Dubai are deep into preparations for other cultural and community events,” Cortes said.“We have other events in the pipeline and we hope the entire UAE community take notice of how talented and great the Filipino contributions is,” he added.
Sport is gaining popularity in the UAE and many say that it has transformed their livesAbu Dhabi: Women in Crossfit! Isn’t that a sport for the meatheads and bodybuilders? Well, that’s the notion that most of us have.Nevertheless, had you been to the Abu Dhabi Throwdown CrossFit event organised by Peak Fitness during the Ramadan Sports Festival in the capital that impression would have been erased in a flash.Physiques do vary and not everyone who does CrossFit builds muscle mass. Even skinny girls can be strong without losing their feminine grace and that realisation has drawn a lot of Emirati women to take up the sport. These ladies want to give themselves a constantly varied highly effective mix of cardio, weightlifting and gymnastic programmes not just so they can leda happy and healthy lives but also win laurels for the country.Nuha Al Merri, who is currently the No 1 in the UAE among Emirati women in the sport, recollects that she had started CrossFit as a means of recreation in 2013 and immediately got hooked to the sport.“I had been hitting the gym even before but Crossfit has changed my life completely. I like the challenge it provides and that’s what made me to take up the sport full-time,” says Al Merri, who is also a CrossFit coach based in Dubai.Al Merri, however, recalls that her choice to take up the sport as a profession was met with strong opposition from her parents, especially her mother.“Initially, it was really tough to convince her [mother] but over a period of time she realised that my heart and soul is in CrossFit. When your family starts backing you in what you do, then things become a lot easier,” recalls Al Merri, whose efforts started paying high dividends at the GCC meetings within a year or two. She has also competed in Open events at Madrid and Denmark.“There were very few Arab girls initially. I clearly remember in 2014 there were only seven Arab girls competing in Kuwait at the Battle of the East. That number went to 10 the following year. So the interest is growing and more Arab girls are being drawn to the sport and taking it as a profession,” says Al Merri, who won gold in Qatar last year and back-to-back silvers in Kuwait in 2014 and 2015 banking on her strengths – gymnastics and weightlifting.“I want to qualify for all the major CrossFit tournaments globally and try and win medals there. My goal is to put UAE on the map and show that UAE women are not behind in anything. This year I have set my sights on Emirate Fitness Championship, Dubai Fitness Championship and also want to qualify for the Madrid event,” revealed Al Merri, who is not the only one in her family to be drawn to the sport. Her sister Latifa Al Merri and brother-in-law Waleed Karam are also into CrossFit.“I was into Muay Thai before but found that CrossFit was more fun to do. My husband also is a regular; so we share the same passion, you can say. We train together and egg each other on to excel. So it has made my journey so far easier, you can say, unlike other Emirati girls. However, things are slowly changing and many Emirati youngsters are drawn to the sport,” said Latifa, who is also keen on doing well at the regional CrossFit tournaments.For those who are still not convinced that they could be skinny yet strong with CrossFit, Sofia Bin Salem, another Emirati, can vouch for its benefits.“If you don’t want a muscular physique, then all you need to do is focus on your diet. I never wanted to put on muscle. You will be surprised to see skinny women like me handling so much weight. It is about technique and endurance. Girls who have more mass seldom struggle when it comes to endurance,” says Bin Salem, who also revealed that ladies with a lot of bulk who have taken to CrossFit have made that choice on their own.“These women athletes make a conscious effort on building the body as normally women don’t have the strength like the men to lift these heavy weights. So a lot of effort is put on the upper body and they increase their food intake. If we have food four times a day, the girls who want to put on mass may eat six times a day,” revealed Bin Salem, adding that, focus however in either case is the same – eating healthy with the meals comprising of lots of carbohydrates and protein.Dunia Khaleel, MD of Peak Fitness, who organised the tournament in the capital on behalf of Abu Dhabi Sports Council, was overwhelmed by the response to the event.“The sport is making giant strides within the UAE and region over the past couple of years. The good thing is around 15 Emirati women athletes participated in the event and few of them are already creating waves at the international level. We didn’t do any advertising for the event and still so many ladies came. We had competitors from Qatar and Oman as well, which is a sign that the sport is prospering within the region,” said Khaleel.
Dubai: With unanticipated emergency situations and natural disasters occurring rather frequently around the world, mobile technology is what most people instinctively turn to when dialling for help.Since the advent of smartphones, dozens of emergency apps have emerged with the aim of helping people communicate in a faster and more affective way in times of crisis.One recently introduced feature on Facebook that was created after the Paris attacks, which killed 127 people in October of 2014, is the Safety Check tool. This feature automatically sends users in disaster areas a message asking about their status and safety. Notified users then have an option to click yes, to let their friends and family know they are okay on Facebook.The app notifies users during shootings, violent public acts, earthquakes, and other natural disasters.“Some telecommunication companies and social media platforms are implementing emergency features in smartphone applications to further aid in crises or emergency situations. One of these is Facebook’s recently activated function in emergency situations, which — using your GPS — it allows users to ‘check in’ if they are safe and in the vicinity of an emergency situation,” pointed out said Fahad Al Hassawi, Chief Commercial Officer at du.Just the same, DisasterAWARE is another emergency app, which allows a mobile phone to monitor and warn its user about any early sign of natural disaster around the world. It is currently being used by 1.5 million worldwide.“Many would agree that the first port of call in an emergency would be our mobile phones. As a communication tool, mobile technology lets us immediately connect with the emergency services, as well as contact our friends and families to let them know we are safe, and vice versa,” said Al Hassawi.For residents in the UAE, the Dubai Police’s high-tech security programme, SOS (Save Our Souls) allows people to contact the emergency services at the touch of a button — either via a smartphone application or a wristband.“Once the button is pressed, police emergency numbers are dialled, the GPS system will start working and all information about the user will be available in the operations room at the headquarters,” said Tahani Karrar-Lewsley, chief executive officer and founder of Menar Media.The SOS service is now available on Thuraya XT phones, which works via satellite and allows people who are in deserted areas or at sea, where there is no mobile phone signal, to call for help if they have a satellite phone.Other emergency apps include Social Alert, National Ambulance app 998, Dubai Ambulance’s app Olem and Same’e.The Social Alert allows you to send out custom emergency messages with your exact location to friends and family on social networks such as Twitter and Facebook in times of need, explained Lewsley.The National Ambulance 998 app enables users to request an ambulance without the hassle of phone calling. “The app also has a great feature that provides a first aid guide with illustrations with easy steps to follow on what you should do in a variety of situations such as choking, bleeding, burns, allergic reactions and strokes,” she said.Emergency apps for disabled usersFor disabled users, Olem and Same’e are recommended apps.Olem allows visually impaired people to request for ambulance services by pressing the power button of the mobile phone three times in a row to launch the application, even in cases where the phone is locked by password, said Lewsley.“The Same’e app caters to hearing-impaired residents, allowing users to request for an ambulance through the use of text messages and multiple choices to describe the emergency situation as thoroughly as possible,” she added.Similarly, The Red Panic Button app allows users to contact many users at once in a state of crisis. The user-centered Early Warning and Vulnerability Alert System (EWVAS), will send your GPS coordinates and a link to Google Maps, by SMS or email, to a previously specified contact list. This feature can also send the posts to your Facebook or Twitter account.Connectivity and coverageHowever, Al Hassawi pointed out that connectivity to the internet in such situations is crucial to help keep people safe and, in some cases, save lives.“As long as your mobile network has strong partnerships with global network leaders, no matter where in the world you are, your smartphone can aid you and be an all-purpose emergency kit, offer medical assistance and outline basic first aid,” he said.Your smartphone can also use GPS services to navigate a way out of a crowded or accident situation, he added.
Dubai: When German expatriate Johannes Waimer saw an oil drum in the Bahamas, he never thought that he could re-imagine it and design it into a water heater requiring no power and one that saves tonnes of carbon emissions yearly.Waimer, a solar consultant with Premier Solar Technologies, was sailing in the Caribbean in 1989 when he spotted a man taking a shower outdoors.“Because I was a sailor, we sailed worldwide and I was wondering one day when I saw a man on the roof with a black oil drum, but on the oil drum were some pipes. So I called him and asked him what he was doing; he said: ‘I make my shower water by solar,’” Waimer, 77, one of the first residents to advocate solar in the UAE, told Gulf News.The oil drum was painted black so it could absorb heat. The water inside is heated solely by the sun to 40 degrees Celsius.It was at around the same time that Waimer was asked to design a simple, effective, and affordable solar water heater unlike existing German models that could do the job but were too expensive back then.“From that idea [oil drum], the integrated storage collector was developed with the best reflector, best absorbing spray on the surface of the tank and in total selective coating — everything which is possible with the technology of today,” Waimer said.The oldest storage collectors Waimer produced have since been used in the Caribbean islands, besides north and central Africa for the past 25 years.The fourth generation of the storage collectors is now manufactured in Dubai. The storage collector was also tested in Jordan for use in the Middle East.The reflector inside the casing of the water tank reflects incoming rays of the sun into the tank. The central core gets heated, which eventually heats the water around it — all done for free by Mother Nature without the need to burn fossil fuels.Waimer said one storage collector can help offset two tonnes of carbon emissions every year compared to conventional electric water heaters. “I don’t understand why people are still using electric heaters despite the common knowledge that they can save the additional heating [from burning fossil fuels], which is polluting the atmosphere. Electric water heater should be eliminated,” he said.Although in most instances, tap water in the UAE tends to be hot in the summer, Waimer said that there are roughly four to five months in a year during and after winter when hot water is needed. In most cases, hotels too need hot water all year round.Waimer said a number of government agencies, hotels and educational institutions have been using his storage collector for years thereby helping keep tonnes of carbon dioxide from being emitted into the atmosphere.Utility bills can also be shaved off in the long-term. Waimer said an average three-bedroom villa that has four conventional water heaters could easily consume 10kw to 15kw in heating water. That could be around Dh300 per month, multiplied to a minimum of four months in a year (the cooler months), setting one back by Dh1,200 per year.Waimer said that relying on a solar water heating system is like buying the equipment but getting free energy needed to heat water for the next 10 to 20 years, which otherwise residents would have had to pay for anyway in utility bills for the same period.
Dubai: Dubai has topped cities in the Middle East and climbed a notch higher at No. 2 among the world’s cities with “most-improved liveability”.In 2015, it was ranked No. 3 under the same category.Dubai’s ranking as the second most-improved city in Economist Intelligence Unit's Global Liveability Ranking in 2016 saw its rise in the rankings over the last five years. The report, published late on Thursday, came from an assessment of the best and worst living conditions across the world, an annual survey conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit called “Global Liveability Report”.Dubai followed Tehran — and was ahead of Harare in Zimbabwe — as the city with the most-improved liveability.Melbourne kept the top spot as the world’s “most liveable city”, followed by Vienna and Vancouver and Toronto.Dubai invests high in living standardsJon Copestake, the report’s editor, said: “Dubai and other Emirates have been seen as something of a safe haven for businesses and expatriates given the wider disruption in the Middle East, especially with oil prices affecting economies of other Gulf States like Saudi Arabia.” #Dubai tops Middle East cities in Economist Intelligence Unit's Global Liveability Ranking, comes #2 globally in term of improvement over 5y— Dubai Media Office (@DXBMediaOffice) August 18, 2016 Some 140 cities were rated based on comfort for over 30 qualitative and quantitative factors – each rated as acceptable, tolerable, uncomfortable, undesirable or intolerable.Certain cities —  Zurich, Geneva, Frankfurt, Berlin, Oslo, Luxembourg, Brussels, Paris, Rome and Lisbon — saw declines in liveability, “mostly stemming from heightened fears of terrorism in the wake of attacks in Paris and Brussels,” the report said.These are the Top 12 cities to live, in terms of quality of life:1.

World Humanitarian Day 2016, which falls on August 19, is being marked with vigour by UAEAbu Dhabi: His Highness Shaikh Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, tweeted on Thursday on the occasion of World Humanitarian Day 2016, which falls on Friday.“Tomorrow, the world marks World Humanitarian Day, and the UAE will mark it alongside the world in its capacity as a humanitarian capital and the country with the largest humanitarian aid relative to its GDP,” Shaikh Mohammad tweeted.“As we mark this day, the refugee issue remains the most pressing issue, particularly that of Syrian refugees. The UAE provided Dh2.65 billion in aid for them, and we will continue to do so. The UAE hosts the largest gathering of international relief humanitarian organisations, designating an entire humanitarian city for them. Our institutions are also operating in more than 70 countries. Humanitarian work is a joint language of compassion between people, it knows no ethnicity, religion or identity. It is what makes a human a human, and it is what makes any peoples civilised,” Shaikh Mohammad said.Reem Ebrahim Al Hashemi, Minister of State for International Cooperation, said that the theme ‘One Humanity’ for World Humanitarian Day 2016 complements the values that stem from in the UAE leadership’s vision and Emirati traditions and communities.“Today, we join our voices with the international community to mark World Humanitarian Day, which marks the day 22 humanitarian workers lost their lives in the bombing of the UN Headquarters in Baghdad in 2003. Thirteen years have passed and now, more than ever, there is still an urgent need to respect and recognise the work of humanitarian workers,” said Al Hashemi.Al Hashemi said the UAE has provided humanitarian assistance totalling Dh6.97 billion to help save lives, alleviate suffering, maintain and protect human dignity during and after emergencies, including long-term assistance to refugees and displaced persons.Al Hashemi pointed out that there are three key drivers within the UAE’s humanitarian framework, the first being protecting civilians during emergency humanitarian situations, particularly women and children. The second is to work closely with local and international organisations because they are capable of effectively distributing aid, and finally, bolstering global humanitarian efforts through purposeful cooperation.She pointed out that providing humanitarian aid and saving lives would not be possible without the unwavering commitment of men and women who risk their lives for the sake of others and provide hope for a better tomorrow.In her statement, Al Hashemi also touched on the UAE’s response towards humanitarian crises that affect people in the region.She said that from 2012 to July 2016, the UAE has provided urgent humanitarian valued at Dh2.65 billion for Syrian refugees in Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.She also pointed out that the UAE had provided Dh1.5 billion in humanitarian aid for Yemen.Shaikh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Ruler’s Representative in the Western Region and President of Emirates Red Crescent, reaffirmed the UAE’s commitment to its humanitarian responsibility in order to alleviate the suffering of people.In his World Humanitarian Day statement, Shaikh Hamdan said that the UAE, under the leadership of President His Highness Shaikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, continues to take steps towards improving and developing humanitarian and relief work. He said that the UAE transformed humanitarian work from an emotional action taken to assist during a crisis or emergency to a permanent developmental plan that meets the requirements of needy communities.Shaikh Hamdan added that the UAE has become a key hub for launching creative humanitarian initiatives and rallying support for humanitarian issues under the directives of Shaikh Mohammad Bin Rashid and His Highness Shaikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces.Dh2.65 billionUAE aid for Syrian refugeesDh6.97 billionTotal UAE aid to the world
Poor visibility due to blowing dust kicked up by easterly winds expected over northern UAE Dubai: Residents are advised to drive with caution on highways especially in open areas as visibility could deteriorate due to dusty conditions this weekend, forecasters said on Thursday.Forecasters from the National Centre of Meteorology and Seismology (NCMS) said fresh easterly winds over the northern UAE could cause poor visibility on Friday and Saturday.“Reports of sandstorms are not true; it's just blowing dust. Easterly winds with speeds of 20km/h to 25km/h, reaching 45km/h to 50km/h maximum, could cause rising dust especially in exposed areas. The NCMS is urging motorists to drive with caution as visibility could go down to below 1,500metres,” a forecaster told Gulf News.Maximum temperatures will continue to be in the 45C to 48C in internal areas. But relative humidity will contribute to people's discomfort as it is expected to increase to up to 95 per cent during the night till early mornings, especially along the western coast. Other coastal areas like Dubai will have humidity levels of 85 per cent to 90 per cent at night.Convective cloud activity will continue over the eastern and southern part of the UAE. Towering cloud formation is expected in these areas, associated with rainfall and moderate winds in general.The Arabian Gulf and Omam Sea will be moderate, becoming rough at times.

Abu Dhabi: The UAE is giving more attention to the Asian nations resulting in a high level of cooperation and collaboration between them, a diplomat said on Thursday.The visit of Shaikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE Foreign Minister, to several Asian countries this year proves this point, said Kairat Lama Sharif, the ambassador of Kazakhstan to the UAE. He was speaking to Gulf News on the sidelines of a fortnightly meeting of Group of Asian Ambassadors in the UAE on Thursday, which was hosted by him.Twenty-nine ambassadors of Asian countries are members of the group that meets twice a month to share success stories and development projects in their countries.Ahmad Anwar Adnan, the Malaysian Ambassador to the UAE, is the present chairman of the group. Each ambassador takes turn to host the regular meeting and it was the Kazakhstan ambassador’s turn on Thursday.Sharif said he was happy to work as a diplomat in a country that has a global stature. “The fact that the UAE is hosting more than 100 (one hundred) foreign diplomatic missions shows that it is giving attention to almost all countries across the world.”He appreciated the contributions of T.P. Seetharam, the Indian ambassador, and Chang Hua, the Chinese ambassador, who are leaving the UAE after ending their terms. As the representatives of two leading Asian nations, they played a major role in the diplomatic community. President His Highness Shaikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan bestowed the Order of Independence upon Seetharam and Hua, which is a testimony to their contributions, Sharif said.Seetharam was presented with a memento at the event. Hua could not attend the meeting because of an official engagement.The meeting also welcomed the new ambassadors of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and the new chargé d’affaires at the Turkmenistan Embassy in Abu Dhabi.Sharif presented a manifesto of Nursultan Nazarbayev, President of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Titled “The world — 21st Century”, it says there is a threat of a deadly war on a global scale and calls for immediate actions for peace and harmony. “Our civilisation, by scholars’ estimates, has survived more than 15,000 wars, approximately three every year. The virus of war continues to poison the international situation. It drives the military-industrial complex, which in some countries has become the most powerful sector of the economy. It may even in the future infect the development of artificial intelligence. Militarism has deeply penetrated our minds and behaviour. There are more than one billion small firearms in the hands of people. Thousands of civilians die every day from their use,” the president said.
Health authorities focus on the elderly populationDubai: The Dubai Health Authority (DHA) is looking at expanding geriatric care.  Quoting stastitics on the geriatric population, Dr Tamer Farid, geriatrician at the DHA’s primary health care sector, said: “Population growth and the increase in life expectancy are important factors that will increase the number of elderly population and thus the focus has to be on healthy ageing. According to 2012 statistics, the population above the age of 60 years in Dubai is approximately 11,400. In the 1960s, life expectancy in the UAE was 53 years. Today, the average life expectancy in Dubai is 78 years for females and 75 for males and it is higher compared to some other Middle-Eastern countries. Therefore, the emphasis has to be on healthy ageing.”Dr Farid advocated that patients should be aware of the concept of healthy ageing and should undergo regular yearly screenings as well as additional tests for osteoporosis, bone density etc so that they can easily treat their ailments with minimum complications. He added this helps them lead a better quality of life and become independent to the best extent possible.Dr Farid said: “The DHA’s primary health care centres have several specialised clinics for geriatric patients. In 2012, the rehabilitation team conducted 175 home visits for 27 patients, in 2013, the team conducted 292 visits for 32 patients and in 2014, we conducted 550 visits for 60 patients.”In addition to these services, the DHA also conducts a monthly Alzheimer’s support group and also has a 24/7 Alzheimer’s Helpline (056 3710077) that provides reliable information and support to caregivers, health care professionals and the public.
Abu Dhabi: Residents of Bin Arar Tower that has been without power for a week now have been given free hotel accommodation from Wednesday evening.The ordeal for residents at the 26-storey Bin Arar Tower started last Thursday as reported by Gulf News, after a short circuit caused power failure. Since then, the residents have been left without air-conditioning and gas, forcing many of them to find accommodation elsewhere. Although power was not restored as of press time on Thursday, the residents were happy to get a reprieve in the form of free hotel accommodation.The residents said Abu Dhabi Commercial Properties (ADCP) which manages the building offered them free stay in Vision Twin Towers hotel apartment.“This is a step in the right direction. It’s still not an ideal situation and we would obviously love to be back home, but it is better than nothing. I have been given a two-bedroom apartment and there is a cooking area so it will be good to finally be able to cook something to eat rather than always having to eat outside,” said a resident who did not want to be named.Another resident said the free accommodation was a positive development for him and his family. “The free accommodation will last until the power is restored back to our building — which I am told will happen soon and that they are working hard every day to resolve the situation as soon as possible,” he added.A representative of Vision Twin Towers confirmed to Gulf News that the residents of Bin Arar Tower would have their room expenses paid for by the ADCP. The representative also added that residents must call the hotel and give their name and national ID number to confirm that they are a tenant living at the building. Tenants can call Vision Twin Towers on 024995555 to arrange their accommodation.The residents were initially told that they would be reimbursed Dh350 a day for their accommodations and they were waiting for it.When contacted, ADCP said that they were not responsible for the running of the building’s facilities, but they were doing everything they could to help the tenants.“Abu Dhabi Commercial Properties have no direct responsibility for the administration of the facilities for this particular property [Bin Arar Tower]. The ADCP’s role is limited to the representation of the owners of this building as property manager,” Mohammad Binbrek, ADCP’s general manager, said in a statement issued to Gulf News.“However, out of concern for the tenants’ well-being, ADCP stepped in proactively to assist the landlords in handling the tenants situation and engaged proactively with all authorities concerned, including Abu Distribution Company, Civil Defence as well as a number of specialised contractors, to help restore full power supply to the building within the shortest possible period to avoid any further inconvenience to tenants and businesses,” the statement added.

Sharjah Police introduce new radar system targeting motorists who use hard shouldersSharjah Police introduce new Radar systems targeting motorists who use hard shoulder and  vehicles not abiding by their designated lanesSharjah: Sharjah Police are cracking down on reckless drivers who buzz along the hard shoulders of highways at high speeds to avoid being stuck in traffic.The crackdown begins on Sunday, said the Directorate of Traffic and Patrols at Sharjah Police, when a new radar system that nabs hard-shoulder offenders and vehicles not sticking to their lanes, will start taking pictures of errant people behind the wheel.The new radar system is part of the strategy of the Ministry of Interior to ensure the safety and security of road users.In the first stage, a total of 10 radars would be installed along roadways in the emirate on Friday and Saturday.The new radar will be installed on Al Ittihad Road, Shaikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Road and Shaikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Road.The number will be increased over time, according to a plan set by the Sharjah Police.Colonel Abdullah Mubarak Bin Amer, Deputy Director-General of Sharjah Police, said the new radars will start operating from Sunday.Captain Jamal Bu Afra, Director of Road Monitor Branch at the police’s Traffic and Patrol Department, said the police said the new device is equipped with a high-resolution camera, and advanced photo and video systems.“It will monitor roads more closely to catch those who drive on the hard shoulder and those who do not abide by their lanes,” Captain Bu Afra saidThe radars will help ease traffic flow during peak hours by 30 per cent, according to a study carried out by Sharjah Police, he added.
General Dalbir Singh claims favouritism by V.K. Singh, who has since become federal minister, scuppered his chancesNew Delhi: In an unprecedented step of a serving army chief taking on one of his predecessors, General Dalbir Singh has alleged that he was “sought to be victimised” by Gen(retd) V.K. Singh, now a federal minister, with the sole purpose of denying him promotion as army commander.Gen Dalbir Singh made the allegation in an affidavit filed by him in his personal capacity while responding to a petition moved by Lt Gen (Retd) Ravi Dastane who had alleged “favouritism” during his selection as the army commander.“I was sought to be victimised by the then COAS [chief of army staff] with the sole purpose of denying promotion to the appointment of army commander. False, baseless and imaginary allegations of lapses were levelled against me in the show cause notice [of May 19, 2012],” Gen Dalbir Singh said. V.K. Singh is currently the Minister of State for External Affairs.“Despite there being no evidence against me at the Court of Inquiry, the show cause notice was issued malafidely,” he said, adding that, “no material whatsoever of attendant circumstances was provided to me. The show cause notice issued, beside suffering from vagueness, was premeditated and also against the principles of natural justice”.Dalbir Singh was placed under a discipline and vigilance [DV] ban by the then COAS V.K. Singh in 2012 for his alleged “failure of command and control” after a Court of Inquiry was ordered into an operation carried out in Jorhat, Assam on the night of December 20-21, 2011 by the 3 Corps Intelligence and Surveillance Unit.Dalbir Singh, who was the then General Officer Commanding of the unit, said that the imposition of DV ban upon him and issuance of show cause notice by the then COAS “was illegal and premeditated”.“It is thus established that I was victimised for extraneous reasons by the then COAS and hence the illegal imposition of DV ban by the then COAS could not be made the basis by the apellant to challenge my appointment as GOC-in-C, Eastern Command. In fact, it is the answering respondent who is the victim and not the appellant, as is sought to be made by him,” he said.
Annual drive launched in 1996 draws good participation from employeesDubai: Dubai Municipality held its annual blood donation drive on Thursday in cooperation with the Blood Donation Centre of Latifa Hospital of Dubai Health Authority.The campaign held at the City Hall of the municipality from 9am to 12pm received tremendous response from the employees of the civic body.Khalid Badri, the director of Corporate Marketing and Relations Department, said in a press release that the campaign aims at supporting the national efforts to encourage voluntary blood donors. “It also carries an awareness objective of educating people on a larger scale of the need to donate blood regularly due to its short shelf life.”He also stressed that the campaign draws great attention to the health of blood donors and the quality of their care. “It is a critical factor to achieve the commitment and willingness of blood donors, thus contributing to the dissemination of a health awareness culture among the community and the municipality employees. The campaign also contributes significantly to the promotion of the concept of social unity and integration as well as the spirit of social responsibility and human values,” said Badri.Doctors advocate the multiple health benefits to the donors from blood donation initiatives. It stimulates the heart muscle and blood circulation, which helps reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke among the donors, in addition to reducing blood pressure and cholesterol. One bag of blood can save three people in urgent need of blood.Dubai Municipality launched the annual initiative in 1996 and it receives the participation of a large number of employees every year.
Dubai: Hundreds of anxious UAE students on Thursday received their A-Level results, described as record-breaking by several schools.The exams were held in May-June and the results, announced this year on August 18 for students globally, carry considerable weight in university admission prospects.Dubai-based Egyptian student Daniel Nashed, 19, said he “wasn’t expecting” to score four A*s (A-stars), which is the highest rank in the exams, above A. Nashed, a grade 13 student of GEMS Jumeirah College in Dubai, earned A*s in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Further Mathematics.“The exams were really hard, so I wasn’t expecting A*s. I was expecting As. I’m going to study civil engineering at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles],” he said.Nashed was the topper in his school, joining eight other students with four A*s in GEMS schools.Thursday’s results also included results for AS-Levels, which precede A-Levels. In GEMS schools, 405 students took A-Level exams while 693 sat for AS-Level tests.The total number of UAE students who took the tests, administered through different governing bodies, was not immediately available.Indian student Devika Dahiya, also from Jumeirah College, earned three As (in Biology, Chemistry and Physics), and a B in Maths. She described the wait for the results as an anxious time, saying she was relieved to finally learn how she fared.“Devika has done us mighty proud,” her father Deepak Dahiya said.British student Karishma Sunil, who received a B in Arts and Business, and a C in ICT, is going to attend the University of Creative Arts in the UK. “I was stressed out before the exams, but the exams weren’t that bad. I’m so glad the results are out now,” said Karishma, who took the A-Levels in grade 13 at Jumeirah College.Simon O’Connor, the school’s principal and CEO, said the results were the school’s best since its opening in 1999. He added that the results were more impressive given that the exams were getting “more difficult” every year.“We’re bucking the trend. We have a three-way relationship between students, teachers and parents, whom we involve and work with closely,” O’Connor said.Across the GEMS schools offering the National Curriculum for England, 39 per cent of students achieved A* to A, and 65 per cent achieved A* to B, which is higher than the UK national averages on both counts.In Abu Dhabi, Al Yasmina Academy said 74 per cent of its 31 students finishing the final year of A-Levels achieved one or more A* to B grades, a 10 per cent increase on 2015.Meanwhile, 35 per cent of pupils earned all A* or A grades, a rise of 30 per cent from last year. The Abu Dhabi-based educator is also celebrating a 100 per cent pass rate overall.The school is run by Aldar Academies, which operates seven schools in Abu Dhabi and Al Ain, teaching over 5,000 students.“We are absolutely delighted to celebrate this year’s best-ever post-16-year-olds’ examination results,” said Dr Tim Hughes, Al Yasmina Academy’s principal.The school’s top three students included Emirati Mohammad Al Hashmi (one A* and three As); Iraqi Suma Al Baytee (one A* and two As); and Lebanese Fawzi Hreiki (two A*s and one B).Mohammad has already earned himself a scholarship from the Abu Dhabi Education Council and plans to study mechanical engineering at the University of Bath, England.“Eventually, I’d like to be involved with the UAE space programme or with [Abu Dhabi-based renewable energy organisation] Masdar,” he said.Suma meanwhile plans to go to New Zealand to study dentistry at the University of Otago.What is A-Level and AS-Level?A-Level (Advanced Level) is a qualification under the UK’s General Certificate of Education. It is a school-leaving qualification offered by UK educational bodies to students completing secondary or pre-university education.A-Levels, in general, are composed of two parts — the first one being the Advanced Subsidiary (AS) Level and the second part is known as the A2 Level.The AS-Level, which is qualification in itself, combined with the A2 Level forms the complete A-Level.AS-Level is usually undertaken in grade 12 while A-Level is typically taught in grade 13.There are some variations in A-Levels, depending on the educational body offering them as well as the country it is being offered in.A-Levels are preceded by O (Ordinary) Levels, whose exams are usually taken in grade 10 or 11 in British-curriculum schools.
Residents gather at Bur Dubai temple on the day which symbolises brother-sister bondingDubai: The festival of Rakshabandhan celebrated by Indian expatriates on Thursday has, in the age of e-gifts and couriers, gone beyond a brother-sister bond to symbolise a theme of love and inclusiveness.At the Hindu temple in Bur Dubai on Thursday, priests who stood at the entrance of the temple tied rakhi or sacred thread to all men and women. Prakash Chabbria, head priest of the temple, told Gulf News: “There are many who have rakhis sent by their sisters and they come here to get them tied, then there are women who are away from their brothers and they symbolically tie the sacred thread on our wrists. Besides, anyone who wishes to have a sacred thread tied to their wrist — man or woman — can get it done,” said Chabbria, pointing to the larger theme of love and inclusion in the society that the festival now signifies.In today’s world where brothers and sisters straddle different cities and continents, Rakshabandhan has become e-savvy with sisters sending e-rakhis to their brothers. Courier companies also did brisk business in Dubai, delivering rakhi packs containing a sacred thread, tea lights, candles, incense sticks and sweets.Watch a brother and sister based in Dubai celebrate Raksha Bandhan with rituals dating back thousands of yearsSmriti Kaushal, who lives in Louisiana, USA, sends couriers to her brother Pawan in Dubai every year. “We are particular and like to place the order with an e-portal at least three weeks in advance so that the rakhi reaches my brother in time. We place the online order in the US and the rakhi is delivered in Dubai through India, so the sweets packed with it are fresh too. This is the best way to celebrate the festival across continents,” she told Gulf News.The festival was a special day for Riddhika Khanna who married Nitesh Jain six months ago and is celebrating her first rakhi here. “The festival has special significance when a new bride goes back to her mother’s home to tie rakhi. Although I live in Dubai, going to my mother’s home is a sentimental thing. My brother, Raghav, and I are quite close, especially since my marriage, I have had this realisation,” said Jain as the brother and sister exchanged lavish gifts and sat down for a sumptuous family meal.Raghav said: “Taking leave from work for this was very difficult as people wonder why can’t a simply thread tying ceremony not be wrapped up in the lunch hour. It’s difficult to explain to anyone.”Many Indian female expatriates went to the Indian Consulate and tied rakhi on the wrist of the male consular staff in a modest ceremony held on Thursday evening. Symbolism of RakshabandhanRaksha means security and bandhan means a commitment. The sacred thread or rakhi that a sister ties on the wrist of her brother symbolises the tenuous bond between them and is also an unwritten pledge by the brother to protect his sister. Gifts are exchanged. Events on Friday8.30am: Care2share, a voluntary organisation, will provide breakfast to 600 blue-collar workers near Al Quoz Mall. Volunteers of the organisation will tie rakhi on the wrists of workers.5pm to 8.30pm: The Indian People’s Forum will host a Rakshabandhan special programme with a narrative on the significance of the festival at Indian Consulate Auditorium. Politician and Bollywood actress Hema Malini will be the chief guest.
File picture for illustrative purpose. The ban on so-called burkinis, at the height of the French Riviera’s vacation season, comes as France remains on edge after deadly extremist attacks on nearby Nice and on a Catholic church in northwest France.Dubai: Are French politicians going too far with the latest local bans on public beaches of full-body swimming garments known as burkinis?Mahdia Magri, a French-speaking Algerian resident, said the ban is a form of discrimination against Muslims and Arabs, who make up a big part of the population, and it would be hard to implement such a rule across France.“Muslim women will not have the freedom to go swimming anymore if this ban is not lifted. As an Arab Muslim wearing a hijab (head cover), I need to wear something that represents me. Many women are still not aware of this ban in France and will be slapped with fines — it’s unfair and makes no sense.”She said she understands that following recent attacks in France, the perception towards Muslim attire has become worse, but believes a ban like this cannot be permanent, as it can never be fully implemented. The “burqa ban”, which outlaws full-face veils in public, is not being followed everywhere, she said.“The swimwear of divers and surfers looks similar to a burkini, including the head cap worn by swimmers. I don’t see why our body-covering swimsuits are being viewed differently in this case.” Mounia A., a French Arab living in the UAE, said she is “completely against the ban” because it goes against the democratic values in France and will fuel more problems between Muslims and non-Muslims.“All around France, you’d find people wearing religious apparel, whether it’s the Jewish cap, the Indian sari or a cross. It makes no sense to ban the burkini only. If such rules are being applied, they should be applied on everyone. Everyone should be able to wear what they want,” said Mounia, who visits France every month.As more towns are in the process of banning the burkini, she said this would create more Islamophobia instead of challenging it.“A democratic government like France should never impose any dress code on its people.”Amelia K. a housewife, who has been to France before, said a burkini ban might be necessary during this period of time because other non-Muslims in France might feel threatened.“There are a lot of prejudices surrounding Muslim attire including people who have long beards. Muslims are wrongly perceived as terrorists in the West and I think this is why officials are trying to implement such rules, to reduce the anxiety that could be felt by people who can’t tell the difference.”

Facebook shares 7 simple tips with users to help they ensure their information, pictures and posts are protectedDubai: Facebook is urging users to protect their information, pictures, and activities by ensuring their privacy settings are modified according to their preferences.The evolution of Facebook over 12 years has brought about new privacy settings to support additional features on the social networking site used worldwide. As of June 2016, there were 1.71 billion active monthly users on Facebook, of which 1.13 billion are daily active users. “Approximately 84.5 per cent of active users are outside the US and Canada,” Tahani Karrar-Lewsley, social media specialist from Menar Media told Gulf News.With over a billion people using Facebook worldwide, many people are cautious about sharing too much information or being exposed to cyber threats.Facebook on Wednesday listed seven simple steps that include modifying and keeping track of privacy and security check-ups, login approvals, trusted contacts, app information control, and activity logs.“To ensure your information, pictures and posts are secure and kept private, you should regularly view what your public profile looks like and what others see when they view your profile.

While Facebook has been keeping track of all these apps, it has given us the ability to restrict their access to our information,” explained Lewsely.Giving users more control, Facebook now offers users an easy way to regulate what information they’re providing to the app (such as your Likes, photos, birthday, hometown etc), as soon as they log in.Gulf News talked to Facebook users about how easy or difficult it is for them to protect their information on one of the most popular social media sites worldwide.“I find it simple to control my privacy settings, which I check on every once in a while to ensure that they are based on my preferences. I usually look out for the users who can see my posts, for contacts who can view my profile, and whether I am easily found on search engines,” said Noura Fahmi, from Egypt.On the other hand, Mohammad Hamood, from Kuwait, said he often finds it challenging to read through the privacy options when trying to make his profile more private.“I think Facebook used to be simpler when it first came out, because there were a handful of privacy options that were easy to understand,” he said.Using Facebook since its launch, the 33 year-old said he is sharing less information on the site, as he is unsure of what can be accessed or viewed by other users. 7 ways to protect your information on FacebookCarry out a privacy check-upThree quick steps to help make sure only the people you want can see your stuff.

Dubai: Have you ever been to a museum that not only takes you back in history, but also takes you on a ride into the future? The Dubai Transport Museum does just that.It reflects as much on Dubai’s past as it showcases its present and future.The Transport Museum, curated by the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), is unique in more ways than one.Located on the ground floor of the RTA’s sprawling headquarters in Umm Ramool, the museum takes the visitors through the landmark moments of Dubai’s transport journey.“Our idea is to document the history of public transport in the city and [the museum] is the first of its kind in the region. This doesn’t just tell the story of transport since the RTA started, rather it tells the story of public transport in Dubai from the mid-20th century all the way to the 21st century,” said Moaza Al Merri, RTA’s Director of Marketing and Corporate Communications, as she took Gulf News on a tour of the museum.Even as it reveals the story of transport, the museum also gives glimpses of how life in the city evolved through past decades.“People who have been here for a long time will, when they visit the museum, be able to relate with a lot of these images and artefacts as they present the era they grew up in,” said Al Merri, pointing to images of Shaikh Zayed Road, when it was just a four-lane carriageway or the Clock Tower when it was not surrounded by so many buildings.Though the museum primarily focuses on evolution of roads and means of transport, some of the plaques on display show how the city went through different phases of development.As you enter the museum, you are welcomed by a miniature model of a 1931 Land Rover, which competed with camels to be the ships of the desert during the 1930s and 1940s of last century.The museum is divided into three distinct galleries and corners, each reflecting different aspects of transport development — history, future and the object theatre.Object theatreThe theatre depicts the story of Dubai’s transformation through a audiovisual medium.Interactive screens take the visitor on a virtual tour of Dubai’s transport progress, as the object the video refers to lights up.A documentary narrates Dubai’s history, showing how people coped with the tough living conditions, faced economic hardship and rudimentary transit options.“Many people know that there was a massive transformation in Dubai over a span of just a few decades but they didn’t know how it happened. The object theatre brings alive those efforts, the difficulties faced and the progress achieved,” said Al Merri.HistoryThe gallery dedicated to history houses different corners for number plates, driving licences, ticketing systems and uniforms that have evolved over the years.Some of the driving licences were in the form of booklet in the early days and also on display are old ticket-punching machines.“We would like to thank the individuals who kept their old licence booklets and donated them to us when we were curating this museum. An old ticketing machine was also given to us by a former employee,” said Al Merri.There is a corner that also shows how the abra, the oldest form of public transport across Dubai Creek, has evolved.Moving on in history, the gallery also shows the development of some of the landmark projects like Al Maktoum Bridge, the first crossing on the creek that opened in 1963, as well as Shindagha tunnel and Al Garhoud Bridge which were built in the 1970s.Stepping into present, visitors can see images and plaques of modern projects like the Business Bay Crossing, Dubai Metro, Dubai Tram and many others.Visitors are then transported into the future through miniature models and plaques.“This gallery gives a futuristic perspective of transportation systems through physical models and interactive screens displaying the vision of transportation and the infrastructure of the emirate,” said Al Merri.FutureThe Museum also houses models of future projects of the RTA, such as the Water Canal, which is set to be completed by the end of this year and the eye-catching design of new metro stations that will come up on Route 2020 as well as the Expo 2020 project.Also on display are projects planned for Dubai up to 2050 along with illuminated plates replicating the anticipated designs of future vehicles such as autonomous vehicles that are currently on trial in Dubai.An interesting feature of the future gallery is an interactive game that the visitors can play to design future modes of transport powered by non-conventional sources of energy.Entry to the Transport Museum is free and can be booked through the RTA’s website and is open only for delegations and school groups.The RTA is planning to open the museum for public viewing in the near future, said Al Merri.
Last Exit opened up last month off Shaikh Zayed Road, offering customers with 14 different types of food trucksDubai: The latest food trend has taken over the outskirts of Dubai – have you seen it yet?VIDEOAt the end of July, property developer Meraas opened up a whole new destination for foodies who are up to trying something new.Last Exit, located on exit #11 on Shaikh Zayed Road, Dubai bound, offers motorists a mix of Latin, Middle Eastern and Italian dishes, in addition to 11 other types of cuisines.In the three-minute video, posted by Dubai Media Office, you can see the indoor dining area decorated from car parts imported from the US, ranging from car tyres used as wash basins to bar stools accompanied with bicycle pedals.   All vintage everything! #LastExitDubai pic.twitter.com/4Etc8j9thx— Last Exit Dubai (@lastexitdubai) August 16, 2016While the concept of food trucks is still a novice in the region, organisers said they expect an average of 10,000 vehicles per hour to stop at the 10,500 square metre park, due to its convenient access and maximised visibility on the road.According to Meraas, “Last Exit is the first of its kind in the region and serves breakfast, lunch, dinner or simply, a snack on the way – 24/7, seven days a week.”Even though we are still in the full swing of summer, don’t let the hot weather put you off as the food park does have indoor seating available for up to 90 people.
Airline tickets, hotel rooms selling very fast as residents rush to book Eid trips earlyDubai: Tour specialists in the UAE are seeing an unprecedented surge in travel bookings for the upcoming Eid Al Adha holidays even before the official dates are announced.Agencies confirmed that they have been swamped with booking requests, with airline tickets to nearby destinations, as well as hotel rooms, selling very fast as residents anticipate a five-day break in September.The government has yet to announce the Eid holidays, but there have been speculations that the first day of Eid Al Adha will fall on September 11, Sunday. If advance astronomical calculations are correct, employees will enjoy at least a five-day break from September 9, Friday.Suraj Ramesh, tours manager of Al Badie Travel Agency, said they have been quite busy lately, as booking requests for the Eid period have increased significantly. He said that families who have just returned from vacation during the school break are again gearing up to take short trips to popular destinations abroad.“We have so far closed transactions with about 30 to 35 families who are planning to travel during Eid holidays next month. Short holidays to Maldives, Seychelles and Sri Lanka are in demand,” Ramesh told Gulf News on Thursday.According to Digvijay Pratap, co-founder and managing director of HolidayMe.com, residents are looking to spend five days away, citing that their customers are securing bookings to travel specifically on September 9 to 13.“There is a tremendous increase in bookings from UAE for the upcoming Eid holidays. The numbers have literally doubled compared to the previous month,” said Pratap.“The main dates for travel during this period [which are popular among our clients] are 9th to 13th September."Also getting a lot of attention from their clients are destinations that are a few hours away by plane, such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Bosnia and Sri Lanka.“Since it’s a short travel period, customers are mainly choosing destinations closer, which are on an average three-hour away by flight,” Pratap said.Premjit Bangara, general manager for travel at Sharaf Travel Services, is also seeing a similar trend, with most of their clients booking 5-day trips during Eid. "We are seeing a steady pattern of leisure bookings coming in for the upcoming Eid holidays. Most of our packages are booked from the 9th to 13th of September," said Bangara."The most popular destinations being booked with us are Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Sri Lanka and Kenya,"There are still a lot of residents who are keeping a wait-and-see attitude, and as the holidays draw closer, travel agents expect to get inundated with last-minute bookings.“The surge in the booking will continue as the dates draw closer as in the past, too, we have noticed that there was a large percentage of people who booked packages closer to the travel date.”

T.A. Razzaq was working on two movies based hereT.A. Razzaq (right) with Dubai-based cinematographer Anil EswarDubai: Award-winning Malayalam script writer and director T.A. Razzaq, who passed away in the south Indian state of Kerala on Monday, was known for exploring themes of human virtues and relationships.His demise has come as a big blow to the Malayali community in the UAE as he left without completing two UAE-based films, the stories of which were expected to have profound effect on the community, his friends told Gulf News.T.A. RazzaqRazzaq, who won four awards wrote scripts for 15 films, was working on a movie based on the life of Ashraf Thamarassery, an Indian expat renowned for repatriating thousands of dead bodies home, and another one titled Uppappa (Grandpa) which tells the story of an Emirati man who weds a Malayali woman.“They were projects that were very close to his heart,” his close friend and Dubai-based cinematographer Anil Eswar told Gulf News.“Uppappa was in fact his dream project. We have seen many movies depicting Arab weddings that used to take place in Kerala’s Malabar region in the past. This story in fact shows the other side of the coin and narrates a very touching story of human relations beyond the borders,” explained Anil, who has worked with Razzaq on two films including the latest one which saw the latter in a directorial role.He said Razzaq had even finalized some scenes in the movie when he was on a hospital bed a few months back.He has worked on about 30 movies as a script writer, story writer and dialogue writer. He has also directed one movie.In 1976, he won the state award for best screen play and best story for the movie Kanakkinavu. It went on to win the National Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration.Razzaq won the state award for best story for the movie Aayirathil Oruvan in 2002.Another acclaimed movie Perumazhakkalam, which was also inspired by the stories of expat Keralites in the Middle East and the diya system here, got the state award for best story for Razzaq and a National Award for Best Film on Social Issues in 2005, among various other awards.About Ashraf Thamarassery’s story, he said, Razzaq was inspired to make a movie after reading a book on the former’s heartbreaking experiences of dealing with dead bodies and people who have lost their loved ones.The book Paretharkkoraal (One for the departed) was written by UAE resident Basheer Thikkodi . “One of the real life stories narrated in the book had captivated him [Razzaq] and he wanted to make the movie based on that,” said Anil.Still in disbelief that Razzaq himself has departed from this world, an upset Ashraf said it was a great personal loss to him. “We all thought he will fight it out and be back in good health. I really don’t know what will happen to the movie now. I just know that if it comes out, it will sensitize more people about a social issue and could have an impact in making some changes in people’s attitude.”Though it is too early to talk about completing the unfinished works of Razzaq, Anil said he and other close friends of Razzaq would definitely strive to ensure that those films hit the screens one day.“We [friends] cannot leave it like that. It is our duty to complete his wish. I am sure we will find a way to do those movies,” he said.
Children in 10-15 age group, caught in the grip of augmented reality, may have a lopsided grasp of the real worldDubai: Augmented reality games like Pokemon Go which superimpose digital information onto real life are seriously hampering the studies and social behaviour of UAE children and can result in physical injuries, health experts have warned.These games blur the lines of interaction and cause serious social and emotional disorders in children in the age group of 10 to 15 who are in the formative years of establishing real relationships, warn health specialists and gaming gurus, they said.Joe AkkawiJoe Akkawi, a gaming enthusiast and tech guru, explained: “Augmented reality has been around for more than a decade but it’s only now that gaming companies are using it extensively. It is different from virtual reality or VR. The VR created an artificial information but augmented reality syncs both worlds and overlays digital information over the real world,” says Akkawi.A child who plays on gaming consoles knows he is in an artificial environment. He or she plays for some time, shuts down the game and is back to the real world. In augmented reality games, however, his own real world is constantly overtaken by digitised images. It is like a child walking with his three-dimensional glasses surrounded by an Alice in Wonderland reality throwing the digital ball to catch a Pikachu perched right behind a bush he may be passing by, Akkawi explained.Psychologists fear that allowing 10-year-olds to play this kind of game will seriously damage their perspective. Mary John, a Dubai-based clinical psychologist, explained how this kind of distortion of real life could impact the formative mind of a young child.Mary John“Children today are already addicted to video games and addiction of any kind that distracts a child to an extend that he does not wash, sleep or eat is bound to affect him physically and emotionally and impact his performance in school. While the human brain has the capacity to differentiate between two- and three-dimensional reality and adapt, seeing life through the prism of augmented reality, as in the case of Pokemon Go, is likely to seriously hamper a young child’s understanding of the real world around him. He will become a loner and refuse to interact with people or know how to return a hug or a smile and this will impact his social and emotional skills that he begins to build in this age.”Some reports suggest that Pokemon Go is helping autistic children venture out of their comfort zones. But John thinks that it is too early to draw such a conclusion. “A child in the autism spectrum usually avoids eye contact or any kind of social interaction. If this game is helping him seek out these digital characters, he is actually being pushed deeper into his world. The game may be helping an autistic child follow instructions and focus but it is definitely not helping his social skills,” added John.Dr Mohammad TahirDr Mohmmad Tahir, child and adolescent psychologist at the Dubai Health Care City, feels that the society is already grappling with teenage addiction to the virtual reality world and the game just represents a step ahead in that addiction. “I receive cases of so many students who are addicted to online gaming that is seriously hampering their studies and overall performance, causing serious behavioural problems. So far no one has reported complication arising out of playing this game but it is only a matter of time.” Physical injuriesTo those who say the game is actually encouraging youngsters to walk around and indulge in physical activity, Dr Tahir says this is counterproductive. “In Pakistan and India, I remember young teenaged boys chased kites, running on rooftops and hanging precariously from heights, and getting electrocuted by overhead cables. Ultimately, the governments of these countries had to ban the sport. So no one can argue in defence saying running after kites was healthy. In the current craze of catching Pokemons, children cross roads, walk across potholes and risk their limbs and lives to capture a digital character to advance to the next level. This cannot be defended as physical activity as the child’s moments are robotic.”Dr Kedar PatnekarDr Kedar Patnekar, specialist paediatrician from Prime Healthcare Group, seconds that. “When a child is hardly aware of his environment and cannot even enjoy the outdoors with healthy interaction, that cannot be counted as physical activity.”Dr Patnekar, who attends to several children injured by motion-sensing games after falls from chairs and who have trigger thumbs caused by pressing the joystick, says it is only a matter of time before “we will have injuries caused by augmented reality games like Pokemon”.If augmented reality games are to be a necessary evil of lives that we cannot wish away, it is time to acknowledge its physical and emotional fallout, and restrict its use in younger children to avert collateral damage as much as possible. ParentspeakUrvashi Palicha, ConsultantUrvashi Palicha“Ever since we visited Disneyland in the US this summer, my 14-year-old son, Aditya, has got addicted to Pokemon Go. We were standing in the park with 25 children around us trying to catch Pokemons. My son downloaded the app right there and got deep into it. Right now he is at a very advanced level. I must commend the shrewd business sense of the gaming company to introduce this in the summer holidays. So whenever I ask my son to keep the phone away, he argues it is his leisure time,” said Palicha.While in the US, the Palichas had a scare when their friend’s 11-year-old daughter was almost knocked down by a car in Los Angeles as she stepped on to the road to catch a Pokemon.“I keep arguing with my son and pointing out the risks and warning him all the time,” said Palicha. However, succumbing to their son’s demands, the Palichas have given their son a basic Dh30 package and allow him to go with his friends to the malls to catch Pokemons.”“There is peer pressure and the child has to feel inclusive in his friend’s community. I countered it by enrolling him in a sports camp where he spends time from 9am to 1pm in pure physical activity and high-octane social interaction. I hope once school starts, Aditya will have other important things to focus on and his game fever will subside.”Samer Constantini, government employeeSamer ConstantiniHe limits the play time by not giving the smart phone to his child. “My son Yousuf is only eight years old and the only time we play this game is when we go to the malls. While my wife and 10-year-old daughter go shopping, my son and I have this special fun bonding time catching Pokemons. I guess until I can keep my son away from having his own phone, I can control this craze.”Pamela Rozario, a teacherPamela RozarioShe has a daughter aged 14 and a son aged 15. Both children are avid enthusiasts of the game. “In the beginning, it was crazy as my children were too caught up with the game catching Pokemons everywhere they went. Luckily for me, in Business Bay where we live, there weren’t many Pokemon stops or gyms. As they were sincere about completing their summer projects, eventually their craze died down. Now they indulge in it once or twice a week and I am a happy mother.”Maria Al DaoudiHer eight-year-old son, Sadiq, is a quite a pro at Pokemon Go, but his mother has yet to give him a smart phone. “That was the best way to contain the craze. Sadiq hated going to the malls but now he happily accompanies me because he looks forward to getting my phone to play Pokemon. I make sure that I would give him the phone only for a limited period, keep an eye on him so that he does not go beyond 50 metres and always tell him the battery is dying or I need to make a call to get my instrument back. So far, he has complied because he is young. I have no idea when I will have to give him his own phone. I am going to push this as far as I can because once you give a child his own smart phone, you cannot really take it back.” Dos and Don’ts for parents1. Keep a strict regimen of time allowed for the game and stick to it no matter how much the child emotionally bullies you2. Limit the child’s data package to prevent him from walking on roads to catch Pokemons and make sure he can do it only where there is Wi-Fi3. Use the allowance time as a reward to encourage good habits — of meeting homework goals, meeting people, indulging in physical sport. Here, the parents have to make sure they do not allow the child to bargain for more time as this can be damaging. Rewards need to be realistic.4. If a child cheats, do not let him get away with it.5. Children imitate parents, so when parents come home, they must put away their smart devices and be with the family entirely to ensure the child’s complete interaction.
We’ve found a new centre offering telescopes, fossils and an escape from the cityA trip into the UAE’s desert for a bit of dune bashing and belly dancing is a rite of passage for any resident or tourist. But there’s much more to the sands than that: How about stargazing and a spot of archaeology? If you’ve got a bit of an Indiana Jones in you, then it’s time to visit Sharjah’s Mleiha Archaeological Centre.Located on the Al Kalba road, the archaeological centre offers a selection of daytime and night-time activities such as stargazing, fossil rock sighting, ecological tracking and trekking, based around the ongoing research into the UAE’s history that’s taking place there. “[Creating the centre was] actually a recent idea [done] to enhance the ecological tourism of Sharjah,” says the centre’s destination manager Mahmoud Al Suwaidi. “There are still excavations going on.”The region is teeming with history and based on excavations made in the 1980s, artefacts that date back to the early Stone Age were found, Suwaidi says. After years of research, the centre was opened in February and offers guests a history lesson wrapped up in entertainment and adventure.I visited the enclosure, about 75 kilometres from Dubai, one evening earlier this summer. The ride is a little lonely and the dim street lights are not very reassuring, so I recommend drivers map out their route before embarking on the journey to avoid getting lost.Peaceful silenceThe hourlong trip from Dubai is worth it once the Archaeological Centre comes into view. The building is in the middle of the desert and is surrounded by small mountains. There is a peaceful silence around the area, well away from the city and the main roads. Here, the dim lighting is welcomed as it not only highlights the Mleiha enclosure from the surrounding darkness, but also helped me feel at one with nature.The main hub offers visitors a museum tour documenting the different periods of human history, revealing how humans survived in the area in the past. With videos, holographic images and state-of-the art technology, the museum tour is a part of all the packages at the Centre and is a must-see.Faisal, my tour guide, and one of the best night-time dune drivers, gave my friends and I the feel of the desert by taking us for a brief ride over the orange dunes and stopping to show us fossil rocks that were embedded in the mountains and could only be seen with the help of water.MajlisThe Mleiha Desert Star Lounge is not a regular feature at the archaeological centre; the majlis is exclusively set up for customers who book it. With a barbecue, Arabic salads and dates, this modest spread is the perfect amount of food before you hit the dunes again (it’s Dh175 per person with a ten person minimum). Sitting under the pitch-black sky, surrounded by lanterns, sand and mountains, it is the perfect escape from the city and makes you feel like you’re in a chapter from Arabian Nights. Feeling the warm sand under your feet with a cold breeze tickling your ears is something else all together. The tranquillity and the minimal lighting helps visitors feel at one with nature and this is what distinguishes the centre from other desert adventures.Not far from the lounge, a telescope is set up to catch a closer glimpse of the stars and planets that decorate the sky. My friends and I were educated on the galaxy, black holes, constellations and other aspects of astronomy.“Every other desert safari will take you either to a camp where you’ll sit down, have a barbecue, chill, see the beauty of the desert on a drive somewhere,” Suwaidi says, “but [you don’t] get to see ancient eras, real artefacts mixed with desert adventures [and] adventure sports such as cycling, trekking and more. You don’t get an expert that talks to you about wildlife and planets, either. So that’s why we’re unique.”Educational experienceThe centre offers activities and adventures that suit the entire family and everyone one can take part in the educational experience while having fun. The 90-minute archeological tour, Dh150, takes visitors around the various historical sites of Mleiha; the night-time off-road tour explores natural landscapes and all tours include the museum tour, which is also priced separately at Dh25. Stargazing and planet-watching (Dh45 onwards) can be done with the help of an expert, as can Fatboy bike guided tours, which start at Dh70.Ajmal Hassan, Mleiha’s wildlife expert, can “tell you each and every Latin name of the animals that exist, [as well as take you] on a trek to show you the animals,” Suwaidi adds.Many of the new Centre’s activities are still being implemented. The centre, which is managed by the Sharjah Investment and Development Authority, Shurooq, will offer paragliding (Dh800) and paramotoring (Dh500); survival camps (Dh2,500, for those over 18) in the desert wilderness and Hammock Camp (Dh150) by early November.TransportationThere are also plans for horse riding, and a hotel is also planned in the area so that people can take part in both the daytime and night-time activities and retire somewhere nearby. If you’re a tourist or can’t brave the long journey, the centre also offers transportation (at additional cost).With my busy schedule, it was nice to take some time out for myself for a change. I’ve always complained that with the pollution in the city and the bright building lights, one can never see the stars in the sky, but after visiting the Mleiha Archaeological Centre; I’ve had my fill for days. Not only did I learn about the history of the region, I also experienced the desert first hand, enjoyed natural views and the tranquillity of the outdoors. It is an escape from the buzzing city and nature lover or not, this place is worth a visit. — Shreya Bhatia is an intern with Gulf News.
Girl with inherited degenerative disease doing much better with private care, says motherAbu Dhabi: Rawdha Al Khoury, aged four years, suffers from an inherited disorder that requires full-time medical care.Diagnosed with Krabbe disease, she was admitted to a long-term care facility more than three years ago. The disorder, which destroys the protective coating of nerve cells, has left her in need of continuous mechanical ventilation.“The improvements I have noticed since she started to receive long-term care are tremendous. As a mother, I worry less about her medical needs now,” Umm Rawdha told Gulf News.All was well till Rawdha turned seven months. Then she started crying constantly and inconsolably, to the point of not even sleeping.Her parents rushed her to intensive care, where she stayed for more than two months. She was then shifted to a facility in the United States for specialised treatment and assessment. Upon her return, she was once again housed at a public hospital for the next four months.“Then a doctor referred us to ProVita International Medical Centre,” Umm Rawdha recounts.At the long-term care, even the details are attended to. Rawdha loves being dressed in red. “Her hair is braided neatly, and she has her nails painted. Rawdha could not get such care at a hospital,” Umm Rawdha said.Rawdha’s care and therapy will cost the family Dh50,000 co-payment each month, or more than half a million dirhams each year. Given that her stay is indefinite and perhaps even lifelong, Umm Rawdha has no idea how the family can cover the cost.“We have experienced hospital stays and I can say that I do not want my daughter to have to go back to that. That said, how can we foot this bill? We have responsibilities to our other children too,” the mother said.Still, Umm Rawdha has not yet given up.“I have faith in God, and I trust that my government, our community and the hospital will only do what is best for my daughter,” she said.
Mother worries about her daughter’s future as care for her daughter is only available in a private facilityAbu Dhabi: As she lies in the children’s ward watching cartoons, comforted by her mother by her bedside, six-year-old Bedour Mohammad Al Ali seems unfazed by the many tubes connected to her little body that help her eat, drink and breathe.Bedour was born with severe epilepsy and has suffered brain damage from her seizures. She also has a rare reflux disease, which means she cannot swallow and when she does, it will come back up. If she is fed in the wrong position, food can get into her lungs.Bedour has also had a tracheostomy and now has an oxygen tube that assists her with breathing.Being in and out of hospitals did not help Bedour’s weak immune system and resulted in her having to spend time in the ICU on every occasion she fell ill.After five years of fighting for her life, it was finally recommended that the best care for Bedour was at the Cambridge Medical and Rehabilitation Center (CMRC) in Al Ain. A year on, her mother and doctors say she is making progress thanks to the specialised care.Her mother recalls the stress she felt every time she had to take Bedour to a hospital due to their lack of understanding about her daughter’s special requirements.“If she were in a normal hospital for three days, I would be with her, awake for three days. Because even if a small thing is not done right, it can be dangerous for her,” she said.Her anxious mother is desperately trying to find out if her daughter’s case qualifies them to be exempt from paying the 20 per cent charges that apply to patients receiving treatment in a private facility.“They told us we will have to pay around Dh12,000 per month, every month. We can’t afford it,” she said.The prospect of Bedour at home is a worrisome thought even for her doctors at CMRC, although they also agree that hospital is not the right place for her. “If she would be forced to go home, I am pretty sure that she would deteriorate,” said Bedour’s doctor, Eeva-Liisa Langille, Medical Director of Paediatrics, CMRC.“No matter how well-intentioned the family [for delivering home care], for some patients, the care is so specialised and needs such precision that it can only happen in an institution which has the skilled personnel for it,” said Dr Langille.For now, Bedour’s family has no choice but to wait for the health authorities’ decision to whether they will be exempted from paying the 20 per cent charges.The paediatric wards in CMRC’s Abu Dhabi and Al Ain branches are filled with similar stories of worried parents who are unsure of what the future hold for them and their children.CMRC confirmed that the average monthly co-payment for their patients based on their level of clinical care could range from Dh20,000 to Dh50,000 per month.
Abu Dhabi: Seven years ago, doctors told Umm Hamad that the baby she was carrying would not live for more than a few days.Today, Hamad is seven, and with constant medical care, is slowly beginning to display voluntary movement and interact slightly with those around him.With the recent changes to the insurance law, however, his mother is worried. Without the kind of care and attention Hamad receives at a long-term care facility, he may not make progress, she says.“My second-born son has finally begun to lift his hand when I greet him. He now rubs his eyes to show he is sleepy, and this is a testament to the constant support he receives from therapists, nurses and other medical staff. If this is taken away from him, I am afraid he will never be able to develop other skills or live a full life,” the 28-year-old Emirati told Gulf News.Hamad was born preterm, and according to his mother, her womb did not have enough amniotic fluid, resulting in his developmental delays. According to his medical reports, he now has chronic respiratory failure, suffers from infantile cerebral palsy (a condition marked by impaired muscle coordination), and requires a ventilator for breathing. He is also prone to sudden seizures.He requires assistance to be moved, bathed and cleaned. But propped up, he can sit and stand for a short while.His medical bills amount to Dh88,350 per day, and a 20 per cent co-payment is equal to Dh17,670. Every year, this would sum up to more than Dh600,000. Umm Hamad says her family would never be able to bear the cost.“I can see that Hamad needs the kind of care that he gets here. To someone else, the fact that he rubs his eyes may seem simple but I know how long it has taken him to get this far. Having seen this improvement, which mother in my position would want to move her son?” she added.Two years ago, Hamad was taken to swimming with a dolphin by facility staff.“Hamad cannot speak or smile, but as his mother, I could feel that he was enjoying the experience. He would not get this chance if he were simply occupying a hospital bed,” she said.“The doctors occasionally take him off the ventilator, but Hamad cannot withstand prolonged periods of time without it. And since his seizures are sudden and unpredictable, we cannot consider home-care,” the worried mother said.“I would like to appeal to the authorities to reconsider our case, and I have full faith that this country and its leaders will not leave its children out in the cold,” she added.

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey vowed Monday to fight Islamic State militants at home and to "cleanse" the group from its borders after a weekend suicide bombing at a Kurdish wedding, an attack that came amid recent gains by Syrian Kurdish militia forces against the extremists in neighboring Syria.The bombing Saturday in the southern city of Gaziantep, near the border with Syria, killed at least 54 people — many of them children. Nearly 70 others were wounded in the attack, the deadliest in Turkey this year.There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but officials said it appeared to be the work of the Islamic State group. Authorities were trying to identify the attacker, who President Recep Tayyip Erdogan initially said was a child. However, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said Monday that it was unclear whether the bomber was "a child or a grown-up.""A clue has not yet been found concerning the perpetrator," Yildirim told reporters following a weekly Cabinet meeting. He said the earlier assertion that the attacker was child was a "guess" based on witness accounts.At least 22 of those killed were children younger than 14, according to a Turkish official who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with Turkish government rules.The attack came after the Syria Democratic Forces, a coalition led by the main Kurdish militia groups in Syria, captured the former IS stronghold of Manbij in northern Syria under the cover of airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition."It appears to be an act to punish the PYD," said Nihat Ali Ozcan a security and terrorism expert at the Ankara-based Economic Policy Research Foundation of Turkey, referring to a Syrian Kurdish group whose militia is fighting IS. "It's the cross-border settlement of scores by two actors fighting in Syria."Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters Monday that Turkey would press ahead with its fight against the Islamic State group inside Turkey and support efforts to remove IS fighters from its borders."Our border has to be completely cleansed of Daesh," Cavusoglu said, using an Arabic acronym for the extremists. IS "martyred our ... citizens. It is natural for us to struggle against such an organization both inside and outside of Turkey."Cavusoglu said Turkey had become a main IS target because of measures it has implemented to stop recruits from crossing into Syria to join the fighting, as well as hundreds of arrests of IS suspects in Turkey."Turkey has always been Daesh's primary target, because Turkey has dried out the source of Daesh's supply of foreign fighters. ... It has stopped them from crossing into Syria," he said.The deadly attack also came amid ongoing struggles between the government and Kurdish militants linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the PKK, and as the country was still reeling from the aftermath of last month's failed coup attempt, which the government has blamed on a U.S.-based Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen, and his followers.The bombing follows a suspected IS attack in June on Istanbul's main airport that killed 44 people; a double suicide bombing blamed on IS at a peace rally in Turkey's capital, Ankara, in October killed 103 people.Ozcan, the security expert, said Saturday's attack was likely carried out by a local IS cell whose members would have known the wedding was a Kurdish one and targeted the wedding party for the "shock" value.The bride and groom, who survived the bombing, urged authorities to act to prevent future bloodshed."They turned our best day to hell. We have no relatives left. They all died," said the groom, Nurettin Akdogan. "I hope this will be the last one. Let no one else get hurt.""From now on, find a solution," added the bride, Besna Akdogan, sobbing.One of the wedding guests, Nursel Saglam, was on a rooftop overlooking the outdoor celebrations when the bomb went off. When she looked down after the explosion, everyone below was hurt or dead, she said."I can't forget that moment," she said, adding that she hasn't been able to return to her house near the scene of the attack and was staying with her sister.Halil Ilter said he was at home when he heard the blast and rushed to the scene to check on his relatives."I cannot recount what I saw," said Ilter, who lost five young cousins. "I am not myself since. There is nothing to say. It was murder.""My uncle's children died. They were aged 13, 14. One was only 5," he said.Associated Press
WASHINGTON (AP) — The top U.S. commander for the fight against the Islamic State group said Monday that he is skeptical of any additional military cooperation with Russia in Syria.And he said he believes he can get the mission done without it, outlining new plans to accelerate the pace and scope of the U.S.-led coalition operations to retake the key Islamic State-held cities of Raqqa and Mosul within the next year.In a wide-ranging telephone interview from Baghdad, Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend said that any decision to cooperate with Moscow is one for the Obama administration to make.But, "as a soldier, I'm fairly skeptical of the Russians," Townsend told The Associated Press. "I'm not sure how much I'm inclined to believe that we can cooperate with them."Townsend's comments on Russia reflect a broader U.S. military reluctance to work more closely with Moscow on operations in Syria, despite requests from Russia to the U.S. to join forces against the Islamic State group in Syria. The U.S. is reluctant to cooperate with Moscow because of its alliance with President Bashar Assad; the U.S. is backing rebels who are fighting the Islamic State but who are also in Assad's sights.Last week, U.S. aircraft scrambled twice to protect American commandos because Syrian government warplanes were bombing nearby.The U.S. routinely speaks to the Russians in order to ensure safe flight operations over Syria and to prevent collisions. In the wake of the Syrian incidents, the U.S. sent its warning message to Syria through the Russians, who have an ongoing, closer relationship with the Syrians.Townsend, who took command on Sunday, also said he plans to step up the military operations in Iraq."We're going to strike more targets, we're going to strike them at a faster tempo," said Townsend, explaining that he wants to give the Iraqi forces the time and space to reset and prepare to retake the northern city of Mosul.As part of that, he said he also will increase the training and equipping of Iraqi forces, including a new effort to provide combat training to Iraqi police. The police, he said, will likely face fighting as they follow Army forces into the cities and try to maintain control of the area and provide security for the citizens living there."In this kind of environment, even the police need some combat training like soldiers — that's something we haven't done a lot of," said Townsend, adding that the U.S. and some coalition allies will do that training.Townsend expressed optimism that Islamic State militants will be defeated in their two main headquarters — Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria — over the next year. But acknowledging that the battles will be complicated and difficult, Townsend said it may well take the bulk of that year to meet his goals.The Islamic State group once controlled large swaths of Iraq and Syria, and has used Raqqa as the de facto capital of the group's self-styled caliphate. But the group has suffered a string of defeats in recent months by local forces aided and backed by the U.S.-led coalition.Townsend said he wants to retake both main cities on his yearlong watch."I think we may have to use all that time but, look, I'm a combat commander and I have a mission," he added. "And I don't intend to turn this over to whoever has to come behind me. It's my intent to get it done."Iraqi officials have suggested they plan to begin the effort to retake Mosul later this fall, and the fight for Raqqa could also start within that timeline. Townsend's vow to have both retaken in the next year only underscores how difficult U.S. commanders believe it will be to drive Islamic State insurgents from those larger, heavily populated strongholds.The U.S. and Iraqi forces are establishing a logistics hub at Qayyarah air base south of Mosul, and Townsend said that American forces could begin moving to the base in the next couple of weeks. Right now construction is still being done to prepare the base and build up its defenses.He also said that as the battle for Mosul gets closer, U.S. advisers may once again accompany Iraqi forces at the battalion level, which is closer to the fight.Last month, the U.S. revealed that American advisers had for the first time accompanied an Iraqi battalion in order to provide advice on how to secure a temporary bridge the Iraqis had installed over the Tigris River. President Barack Obama gave commanders the authority in April to deploy advisers at the lower level headquarters, but commanders have done that sparingly so far."We're about to do larger operations of greater intensity so you could expect that we'll see something like that again," said Townsend Monday. "We will use that capability and authority when situations require it."Prior to Obama's go-ahead, the U.S. military was not permitted to place advisers at echelons lower than division headquarters, which are farther from the front lines.Associated Press

NEW YORK (AP) — Republican Donald Trump promised on Monday to be "fair, but firm" toward the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the United States illegally, a shift in tone that raised questions on whether he's backtracking from previous pledges to push for mass deportations.The billionaire businessman, whose hard-line approach to immigration and fierce rhetoric propelled him to the GOP presidential nomination, insisted that he's not "flip-flopping" on the divisive issue as he works to broaden his support two and half months to the general election. Polls show him trailing Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in both national polls and battleground states.But in a meeting with Hispanic activists on Saturday, Trump indicated that he was open to considering allowing those who have not committed crimes, beyond their immigration offenses, to obtain some form of legal status — though attendees made clear Trump has yet to make up his mind."The impression I got was that the campaign is working on substantive policy to help the undocumented that are here, including some type of status so they would not be deported," said Pastor Mario Bramnick, president of the Hispanic Israel Leadership Coalition, who was in attendance.Bramnick said he'd left the meeting "very encouraged" and "hopeful in anticipating the policy and language" Trump's campaign is expected to release in the coming weeks.Any walk-back would mark a dramatic reversal for Trump, whose tough stand on immigration has been the driving issue of his campaign. During the GOP primary, Trump vowed to use a "deportation force" to round up and deport the millions of people living in the country illegally — a proposal that excited many of his core supporters, but alienated Hispanic voters who could be pivotal in key states.Trump said in an interview with "Fox & Friends" on Monday that he was "working with a lot of people in the Hispanic community to try and come up with an answer.""We want to come up with a really fair, but firm answer. It has to be very firm. But we want to come up with something fair," he said.Asked whether Trump's plan still included a deportation force, his new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said Sunday it was "to be determined.""What Donald Trump says is we need a fair and effective way to deal with the 11 million who are here, who live among us," Conway said on CNBC on Monday. At the same time, she said, he is committed to "protecting American jobs and American workers and also securing our borders, obviously."The discussion comes following a shake-up in Trump's campaign and as he tries to reverse weeks of decline in polls. His team appears to have realized that he must expand his voting base beyond the Republican voters who powered his primary campaign.There have been signs for weeks now that Trump was shifting course. Hispanic business and religious leaders who would like to see Trump move in a more inclusive direction, have reported closed-door conversations with Trump in which they say he has signaled possibly embracing a less punitive immigration policy that focuses on "compassion" along with the rule of law.At last month's GOP convention, the Republican National Committee's director of Hispanic communications, Helen Aguirre Ferre, told reporters at a Spanish-language briefing that Trump had already said that he "will not do massive deportations" — despite the fact that Trump had never said so publicly.Instead, she said, "he will focus on removing the violent undocumented who have criminal records and live in the country."Indeed, Trump's first television ad of the general election specifically singles out illegal immigrants with criminal records, claiming that, if Clinton is elected, "Illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay."But Trump's campaign has pushed back on the notion that he's reversing course. "Mr. Trump said nothing today that he hasn't said many times before, including in his convention speech," rapid response director Steven Cheung said after the meeting. "There is nothing new to report in regards to his plan," added spokeswoman Hope Hicks.Over the last week, Trump has worked to moderate his rougher edges, offering regrets for remarks he's made that have caused pain and sticking with his teleprompter at a series of events. Yet it remains to be seen whether the provocateur will be able to stay on script.After weeks of largely avoiding Twitter, Trump was back on Monday, calling MSNBC's "Morning Joe" "unwatchable!" and one of its female hosts "off the wall, a neurotic and not very bright mess!"Clinton, meanwhile, is spending the next three days fundraising across California, mingling at a series of events with celebrities, Hollywood moguls and technology titans. She'll stop by the home of actors Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel in Los Angeles, address donors with NBA Hall of Famer Magic Johnson in Beverly Hills and join Apple CEO Tim Cook and other business leaders in Silicon Valley.But Clinton's email scandal continues to haunt her. In the latest revelations, the State Department said Monday it is reviewing nearly 15,000 previously undisclosed emails. The emails were recovered as part of the FBI's now-closed investigation into the handling of sensitive information that flowed through Clinton's private home server during her time as secretary of state.Lawyers for the department said they anticipate releasing the first batch of these new emails in mid-October, raising the prospect new messages sent or received by Democratic nominee could become public just before Election Day.___Associated Press writers Lisa Lerer in Los Angeles and Erica Werner in Washington contributed to this report.Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans stepped up their attacks on Monday on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server and pointed to newly released messages to allege that foreign donors to the Democratic presidential nominee's family charity got preferential treatment from her department.Congressional Republicans issued subpoenas to three technology companies that either made or serviced the server located in the basement of Clinton's New York home. The subpoenas were issued Monday by House Science, Space and Technology Chairman Lamar Smith of Texas with the support of Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.In a joint statement, Smith and Johnson said the move was necessary after the three companies — Platte River Networks, Datto Inc. and SECNAP Network Security Corp. — declined to voluntarily answer questions to determine whether Clinton's private server met government standards for record-keeping and security.The subpoenas were among several developments Monday that showed a new GOP emphasis on Clinton's emails after the FBI recently closed its yearlong probe into whether she and her aides mishandled sensitive government information that flowed through her server, without recommending criminal charges.The State Department is now reviewing nearly 15,000 previously undisclosed emails recovered as part of the FBI investigation. Lawyers for the department told U.S. District Court Judge James E. Boasberg on Monday that they anticipate processing and releasing the first batch of these new emails in mid-October, raising the prospect that new messages sent or received by Clinton could become public just before November's election.Boasberg is overseeing production of the emails as part of a federal public-records lawsuit filed by the conservative legal advocacy group Judicial Watch. Representing the State Department, Justice Department lawyer Lisa Olson told the judge that officials do not yet know what portion of the emails is work-related, rather than personal.Clinton, who was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, had claimed that she deleted only personal emails prior to returning more than 55,000 pages of her work-related messages to the State Department last year. The department has publicly released most of those emails, although some have been withheld because they contain information considered sensitive to national security.The thousands of previously undisclosed Clinton emails obtained by the FBI came from the accounts of other people she communicated with or were recovered through the bureau's forensic examination of her old server.Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon reiterated Monday that Clinton provided all the work-related emails she had "in her possession" when the State Department asked for copies in 2014. He said "if the State Department determines any of them to be work-related, then obviously we support those documents being released publicly as well."Olson said the department earlier this month received seven discs containing "tens of thousands" of emails Clinton sent or received during her tenure as the nation's top diplomat. The first disc, labeled by the FBI as containing nonclassified emails not previously disclosed by Clinton, contains about 14,900 documents, she said. The second is labeled as emails containing classified information.She said it was "extremely ambitious" for the agency to complete its review and begin releasing the first batches of emails to Judicial Watch by Oct. 14, given the volume of messages. Judicial Watch lawyer Lauren Burke called that schedule too slow and pressed for faster release of the emails from the first disc. The judge ordered the department to report back to him by Sept. 22.Also on Monday, Judicial Watch released 20 previously undisclosed email exchanges involving Clinton that were turned over by her former deputy chief of staff, Huma Abedin.Among them is a June 23, 2009, message to Abedin from Doug Band, a longtime aide to former President Bill Clinton who then was an official at the Clinton family's charitable foundation. Republicans charge that donors to the foundation, including foreign governments and corporations, got preferential treatment from the State Department while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.Band sought to arrange for the crown prince of Bahrain to meet with Hillary Clinton while the prince was visiting Washington. "Good friend of ours," Band wrote to Abedin, one of Clinton's closest aides.Crown Prince Salman had in 2005 made a $32 million commitment to the Clinton Global Initiative, a program run by the foundation.In later emails Abedin confirmed that Clinton would meet with the prince. Copies of Clinton's calendar obtained by AP confirm the meeting occurred in her State Department office on June 26, 2009.State Department spokesman Matt Toner said Monday there was nothing improper or unusual about the messages with Clinton Foundation staff."There was no impropriety," Toner said. "This was simply evidence of the way the process works in that, you know, any secretary of state has aides who are getting emails or contacts by a broad range of individuals and organizations."___Associated Press reporters Stephen Braun, Eric Tucker and Matthew Lee contributed to this report.___Follow Michael Biesecker on Twitter: http://twitter.com/mbieseckAssociated Press
WASHINGTON (AP) — Syria has been warned not to fly warplanes in areas where American troops are advising Kurdish and Arab forces fighting the Islamic State group, the Pentagon said on Monday. But it insisted this does not amount to a "no fly zone."Reporters pushed press secretary Peter Cook to explain the distinction."Our warning to the Syrians is the same that we've had for some time, that we're going to defend our forces and they would be advised not to fly in areas where our forces have been operating," Cook said."It's not a 'no fly zone,'" he added. Later, he said, "You can label it what you want."Twice last week the U.S. scrambled fighter aircraft to protect American special operations forces and partner forces after Syrian government warplanes flew near the northeastern Syrian city of Hassakeh. Cook said there have been no similar incidents since Friday."If need be we will send aircraft again to defend our forces," he said.Cook said the most recent warnings to Syria not to fly in areas near U.S. troops were communicated through the Russian military, which is operating in support of the Syrian government in its fight against opposition forces, including the Islamic State militants.Asked whether the U.S. policy is to shoot down a Syrian or Russian aircraft if it poses a threat to U.S. troops on the ground, Cook said, "We're going to defend our forces on the ground, absolutely."Cook was highly critical of Syrian military action in and around the divided city of Aleppo, which has become a main battlefield in Syria's civil war. Relentless shelling and airstrikes have killed more than 300 civilians in the city since rebels broke through a government blockade of the opposition-held east on July 31."The Syrian regime aided and abetted by its allies, Russia and Iran, is driving the escalation with its indiscriminate bombing campaign," Cook said. "Bombing densely populated urban areas, interrupting water and electrical services and maiming civilians is only adding fuel to Syria's civil war and does nothing to degrade extremist groups, which was of course Russia's original reason for its military intervention in Syria."Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP) — With suspicions on both sides mounting, the United States is struggling to preserve its wobbly partnership with Turkey as it entertains a closer relationship with Russia and fumes over a U.S.-based cleric it blames for orchestrating last month's failed coup attempt.Vice President Joe Biden faces a difficult mission when he travels to Ankara on Wednesday to try to smooth over recent strains: He comes bearing no assurances that the U.S. will agree to Turkey's demand that it extradite that cleric — Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania. Instead, he'll try to convey that the U.S. still needs and values Turkey as a key NATO ally, even amid worrying signs that the U.S. and Turkish approaches to the region's conflicts may be diverging — especially on Syria.Tensions between the two countries were already bubbling under the surface before the attempted overthrow on July 15, but have since burst into the open. U.S. leaders were incensed when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan alleged the U.S. either supported or was involved in the coup attempt. As the U.S. issued denials, Turkish officials complained loudly that Washington was slow to show support for Turkey's government at its time of greatest need, even though the U.S. expressed support for Erdogan as the coup attempt was underway.At the same time, the U.S. has been rattled by Turkey's recent diplomatic flirtations with traditional U.S. foes Russia and Iran, concerned they may indicate that a frustrated Turkey is rethinking its allegiance with the West in promoting regional stability. This month Erdogan traveled to Moscow to try to boost ties and possibly even collaboration on ending Syria's civil war, something Moscow has sought unsuccessfully with Washington. And following the Turkish foreign minister's surprise trip to Iran last week, Turkish media reported that Erdogan planned to visit Tehran on Wednesday — the same day he's also slated to meet with Biden."Clearly President Erdogan is sending a message by getting closer to Russia and Iran that he's unhappy with the attitude of the West," said Bulent Aliriza, a Turkey analyst at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. "Turkey's still going to remain a NATO member and aspire for EU membership, but the atmosphere is worse than it was on July 14," the day before the coup attempt.A breakdown of ties to Turkey would be problematic for the U.S., which is counting on Turkey to pursue the same approach to fighting the Islamic State group and addressing extremism across the Middle East. Straddling Europe and Asia, Turkey shares borders with Iraq, Iran and Syria, where the porous border has allowed Islamic State fighters in to Turkey, and would-be recruits into Syria.But the U.S. and Turkey are unlikely to resolve their dispute over Gulen, who has lived in the U.S. for years in self-imposed exile. Gulen has denied any involvement in the coup attempt, in which more than 270 died, but Turkey's government has insisted the U.S. return him to Turkey immediately.The Obama administration wants more proof before considering extradition. Although Turkey has submitted extradition requests for Gulen, those requests have been based on previous alleged crimes by Gulen and not evidence of involvement in the coup attempt, senior Obama administration officials said.The U.S. is sending a Justice Department team to Turkey to help sort out the technical requirements of the request, said the officials, who briefed reporters ahead of Biden's trip on condition of anonymity. They added that Biden planned to tell Turkey's leaders that their public allegations of U.S. complicity won't help their cause."People have an expectation that Gulen should be returned to Turkey immediately," said Gulnur Aybet, who teaches international relations at Turkey's Bahcesehir University. "If the extradition request is refused or delayed I'm afraid that's going to have serious repercussions."The U.S. once looked optimistically at Erdogan as a Muslim leader interested in working with the U.S. and pursuing democratic governance. That optimism has been dampened as Erdogan has cracked down on press and other freedoms and his government has put a premium on opposing outlawed Kurdish rebels — sometimes at the expense, in the Obama administration's view — of focusing on IS.Washington's concerns about human rights and democracy in Turkey intensified after the failed coup, which led the government to detain or fire tens of thousands of police, soldiers, teachers and journalists. Yet the U.S. has been careful not to hammer Turkey over those concerns in public out of concern it would undercut the U.S. message of support for Turkey's government.The fragile situation in Turkey was compounded over the weekend when a suicide bomber killed at least 54 people at a Kurdish wedding celebration in Gaziantep, near the Syria border. It was the deadliest attack this year in Turkey, joining other deadly attacks by IS or by the Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the PKK.In another worrying sign for the U.S., Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim appeared to warm to the possibility of Syrian President Bashar Assad maintaining a role in a transitional government. Turkey and the U.S. have both called for Assad's ouster for years, insisting he can't be part of Syria's future government.___This story has been corrected in the 5th paragraph to say the day 'before' the coup attempt, not the day 'of' the coup attempt.___Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey, video journalist Bram Janssen in Istanbul, and Dan Huff in Washington contributed to this report.___Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAPAssociated Press

MILWAUKEE (AP) — Wisconsin's attorney general acknowledged Monday that former Milwaukee police officers, now working for the state Department of Justice, are investigating the fatal shooting of a black man by a Milwaukee officer that triggered two nights of violence.Attorney General Brad Schimel said he doesn't see a conflict in using former Milwaukee officers in the investigation into the Aug. 13 shooting of Sylville K. Smith.Smith, 23, was killed after what Milwaukee police said was a brief foot chase when he ran from a traffic stop. A few hours after Smith's death, a protest on the city's largely black north side erupted into violence that reignited the following night in the Sherman Park neighborhood."Milwaukee PD has about 2,000 sworn officers as I understand. The likelihood that there would be some relationship between a particular patrol officer, who's going to be much younger than an experienced detective... is small. And if there is any relationship at all, that officer, that investigator would not be permitted to have any role in the investigation," Schimel said at a news conference in downtown Milwaukee.He said the DOJ hires many retired officers to work for the Division of Criminal Investigation in the region that they have previously worked. An agency spokesman later said DCI has about 100 officers statewide; of 18 field agents in the Milwaukee office, eight once worked for the Milwaukee Police Department.State Rep. David Bowen, who grew up in the Sherman Park neighborhood, questioned the use of former Milwaukee officers in the investigation and called for Schimel to turn the case over to the U.S. Department of Justice."People are crying out for transparency and crying out for accountability," said Bowen, who represents a large portion of the city's north side.Schimel said his investigators have interviewed all "critical witnesses" at least once, but the investigation into the fatal shooting of Smith is not yet complete. His office has been working closely with Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, who ultimately will decide whether any charges are warranted against the officer who shot Smith, he said.The attorney general said there are two videos from body cameras worn by two of the three officers who were at the scene of the shooting that show similar vantage points, but that no video or still shots from the video will be released until Chisholm is done with the case. There is no surveillance video from the neighborhood, he said.While the video is a component of the investigation, Schimel said it's just one piece among many sources of information."They give only a narrow and incomplete glimpse of the overall picture," he said.The American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin has pressed Schimel's office to release the body camera video. Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said the video clearly shows Smith was holding a handgun and turned toward the officer when he was shot.The first 30 seconds of the video has no audio. That's because Milwaukee police body cameras are set up to continuously record a 30-second buffer of video only. When an officer double-clicks his camera, the device instantly stores the past 30 seconds of video and begins adding audio only at that instant.Schimel said it happened quickly."It's not easy to see everything unless you slow it down" he said.Smith's family has been cooperative in the investigation, Schimel said. The Wisconsin Department of Justice is investigating the shooting, as required by state law for any fatal shootings involving police.___Follow Gretchen Ehlke on Twitter: www.twitter.com/gehlkeAssociated Press

NEW YORK (AP) — Republican Donald Trump promised on Monday to be "fair, but firm" toward the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the United States illegally, a shift in tone that raised questions on whether he's backtracking from previous pledges to push for mass deportations.The billionaire businessman, whose hard-line approach to immigration and fierce rhetoric propelled him to the GOP presidential nomination, insisted that he's not "flip-flopping" on the divisive issue as he works to broaden his support two and half months to the general election. Polls show him trailing Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in both national polls and battleground states.But in a meeting with Hispanic activists on Saturday, Trump indicated that he was open to considering allowing those who have not committed crimes, beyond their immigration offenses, to obtain some form of legal status — though attendees made clear Trump has yet to make up his mind."The impression I got was that the campaign is working on substantive policy to help the undocumented that are here, including some type of status so they would not be deported," said Pastor Mario Bramnick, president of the Hispanic Israel Leadership Coalition, who was in attendance.Bramnick said he'd left the meeting "very encouraged" and "hopeful in anticipating the policy and language" Trump's campaign is expected to release in the coming weeks.Any walk-back would mark a dramatic reversal for Trump, whose tough stand on immigration has been the driving issue of his campaign. During the GOP primary, Trump vowed to use a "deportation force" to round up and deport the millions of people living in the country illegally — a proposal that excited many of his core supporters, but alienated Hispanic voters who could be pivotal in key states.Trump said in an interview with "Fox & Friends" on Monday that he was "working with a lot of people in the Hispanic community to try and come up with an answer.""We want to come up with a really fair, but firm answer. It has to be very firm. But we want to come up with something fair," he said.Asked whether Trump's plan still included a deportation force, his new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said Sunday it was "to be determined.""What Donald Trump says is we need a fair and effective way to deal with the 11 million who are here, who live among us," Conway said on CNBC on Monday. At the same time, she said, he is committed to "protecting American jobs and American workers and also securing our borders, obviously."The discussion comes following a shake-up in Trump's campaign and as he tries to reverse weeks of decline in polls. His team appears to have realized that he must expand his voting base beyond the Republican voters who powered his primary campaign.There have been signs for weeks now that Trump was shifting course. Hispanic business and religious leaders who would like to see Trump move in a more inclusive direction, have reported closed-door conversations with Trump in which they say he has signaled possibly embracing a less punitive immigration policy that focuses on "compassion" along with the rule of law.At last month's GOP convention, the Republican National Committee's director of Hispanic communications, Helen Aguirre Ferre, told reporters at a Spanish-language briefing that Trump had already said that he "will not do massive deportations" — despite the fact that Trump had never said so publicly.Instead, she said, "he will focus on removing the violent undocumented who have criminal records and live in the country."Indeed, Trump's first television ad of the general election specifically singles out illegal immigrants with criminal records, claiming that, if Clinton is elected, "Illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay."But Trump's campaign has pushed back on the notion that he's reversing course. "Mr. Trump said nothing today that he hasn't said many times before, including in his convention speech," rapid response director Steven Cheung said after the meeting. "There is nothing new to report in regards to his plan," added spokeswoman Hope Hicks.Over the last week, Trump has worked to moderate his rougher edges, offering regrets for remarks he's made that have caused pain and sticking with his teleprompter at a series of events. Yet it remains to be seen whether the provocateur will be able to stay on script.After weeks of largely avoiding Twitter, Trump was back on Monday, calling MSNBC's "Morning Joe" "unwatchable!" and one of its female hosts "off the wall, a neurotic and not very bright mess!"Clinton, meanwhile, is spending the next three days fundraising across California, mingling at a series of events with celebrities, Hollywood moguls and technology titans. She'll stop by the home of actors Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel in Los Angeles, address donors with NBA Hall of Famer Magic Johnson in Beverly Hills and join Apple CEO Tim Cook and other business leaders in Silicon Valley.But Clinton's email scandal continues to haunt her. In the latest revelations, the State Department said Monday it is reviewing nearly 15,000 previously undisclosed emails. The emails were recovered as part of the FBI's now-closed investigation into the handling of sensitive information that flowed through Clinton's private home server during her time as secretary of state.Lawyers for the department said they anticipate releasing the first batch of these new emails in mid-October, raising the prospect new messages sent or received by Democratic nominee could become public just before Election Day.___Associated Press writers Lisa Lerer in Los Angeles and Erica Werner in Washington contributed to this report.Associated Press

PROVINCETOWN, Mass. (AP) — It was a very busy, very lucrative weekend for Hillary Clinton in the summer playground of the East Coast's moneyed elite.She brunched with wealthy backers at a seaside estate in Nantucket, snacking on shrimp dumplings and crab cakes. A few hours later, she and her husband dined with an intimate party of 30 at a secluded Martha's Vineyard estate. And on Sunday afternoon, she joined the singer Cher at a "LGBT summer celebration" on the far reaches of Cape Cod.By Sunday evening, Clinton had spoken to more than 2,200 campaign donors. But what she told the crowds remains a mystery.Clinton has refused to open her fundraisers to journalists, reversing nearly a decade of greater transparency in presidential campaigns and leaving the public guessing at what she's saying to some of her most powerful supporters.It's an approach that differs from the Democratic president she hopes to succeed. Since his 2008 campaign, President Barack Obama has allowed reporters traveling with him into the backyards and homes of wealthy donors to witness some of his remarks.While reporters are escorted out of Obama's events before the start of the juicier Q&A, the president's approach offers at least a limited measure of accountability that some fear may disappear when Clinton or Republican nominee Donald Trump moves into the White House."Unfortunately these things have a tendency to ratchet down," said Larry Noble, the general counsel of the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center. "As the bar gets lower, it's hard to raise it again."Clinton's campaign does release limited details about her events, naming the hosts, how many people attended and how much they gave. That's more than Trump, whose far fewer fundraisers are held entirely away from the media, with no details provided.Even some Democrats privately acknowledge that Clinton's penchant for secrecy is a liability, given voters' continued doubts about her honesty.While Clinton will occasionally take questions from reporters at campaign stops, she has not held a full-fledged news conference in more than 260 days — nearly nine months. Trump has held several news conferences.Clinton refuses to release the transcripts of dozens of closed-door speeches she delivered to companies and business associations after leaving the State Department in 2013, despite significant bipartisan criticism.And since announcing her presidential bid in April 2015, Clinton has held around 300 fundraising events. Only around five have been open to any news coverage."It does feed this rap about being secretive and being suspicious," said GOP strategist Whit Ayers.Clinton's aides have promised for weeks that greater access to her events will be coming soon. But Trump's lack of disclosure about his fundraisers has given her political cover to keep the doors closed, particularly as she conducts a period of intense fundraising before the final sprint to Election Day.The White House on Monday declined to pressure the Clinton campaign to follow its practice of allowing reporters to cover a portion of the president's remarks at some fundraisers."Each of the candidates is allowed to make their own case about what kind of value they place on transparency and what steps they're prepared to take to be transparent," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. "President Obama has clearly made this a priority. And he hopes that subsequent presidents will as well."While Clinton is expected to make only two public appearances before the end of August, she and her top backers will mingle with donors at no fewer than 54 events, according to a fundraising schedule obtained by The Associated Press.Reporters covering these events wait outside, in vans, parking lots and vacant guesthouses — even at homes they've entered with Obama at previous events. In Provincetown on Sunday, five reporters crowded into the corner of a parking lot as they tried to catch Clinton's speech to about 1,000 supporters.The candidate could faintly be heard running through her standard stump speech.During a Saturday fundraiser at a stately Martha's Vineyard estate, faint cheers could be heard as Clinton addressed 700 donors on a green lawn overlooking the water. Staffers instructed drivers to roll up the windows of vans where reporters waited before being ushered into a nearby guesthouse.What a candidate tells rich donors has long been a subject of speculation in American politics, partly because the message can be different than what they offer voters.Obama is still haunted by a comment he made at a 2008 fundraiser in San Francisco, calling voters in small-town Pennsylvania "bitter" and saying they cling to "guns or religion." He learned a lesson: At events during his 2012 campaign, staffers set up a table where guests were expected to check their cellphones before entering. Clinton has tried to ban tweeting, Instagram and other forms of social media at some events.Four years ago, a waiter recorded and leaked remarks GOP nominee Mitt Romney made at a closed Florida fundraiser about the "47 percent" of voters who are dependent on government and would vote for Obama "no matter what." After his convention, Romney started opening his fundraisers to the media to grab headlines, especially on days when he had no other public appearances.___Keep track on how much Clinton and Trump are spending on television advertising, and where they're spending it, via AP's interactive ad tracker. http://elections.ap.org/content/ad-spending___Josh Lederman contributed to this report from Washington.___Follow Lisa Lerer on Twitter: http://twitter.com/llererAssociated Press

A new study of women who received hormone therapies as part of their breast cancer treatment has found that the number and seriousness of side-effects they experienced were influenced by their expectations. The research published in the journal Annals of Oncology shows that those women who had an increased expectation of more and worse side-effects before their treatment began, did in fact suffer more side-effects following two years of hormone therapy.The women that held a more positive view regarding their expectations or believed that the effects would not be too bad, experienced nearly half the number of side-effects from the same treatment.The findings have significant implications for people undergoing similar therapies, because if some women experience side-effects which significantly affect their quality of life, then they may stop the treatment, which will reduce its effectiveness and likely result in lower chances of survival. If positive expectations of treatment can lower the risk of side-effects, then measures such as counselling could improve a patient's outlook."Our results show that expectations constitute a clinically relevant factor that influences the long-term outcome of hormone therapy", said Professor Yvonne Nestoriuc, the leader of the study from the Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy at the University Medical Centre, Hamburg, Germany. "Expectations can be modified so as to decrease the burden of long-term side-effects and optimise adherence to preventive anti-cancer treatments in breast cancer survivors."One-hundred-and-eleven women were involved in the study, all of whom had undergone breast cancer surgery and were set to begin a course of hormone therapy. They were questioned about their expectations regarding the possible effects of the treatment at the beginning of the course, and were then assessed at three months, and finally after two years.At the beginning, 63% said they expected mild side-effects, 29% believed they would experience moderate to severe side-effects and 8% said they didn't expect to suffer any side effects.After three months, patients who later dropped out of the trial – 19 people – reported significantly more side-effects than those who remained. The researchers found that after two years, adherence to the hormone therapy was associated with side-effects at three months, as well as expectations at the beginning of the trial.Those women who had lower expectation of side-effects had higher adherence rates to the treatment when compared to the participants who expected to suffer more – an 87% adherence rate compared to 69%. The team also found that higher expectations of side-effects could predict an increase in their occurrence after two years and subsequently, a lower health-related quality of life.Expectations were found to be clinically relevant even after researchers took into account factors that could influence the results, for example, socio-demographic and medical factors, including symptoms that the participants were already experiencing at the start of the trial.Some of side-effects the women experienced included joint pain, weight gain and hot flushes, although there were reports of symptoms which could not be directly attributed to their medication such as, back pain, breathing problems and dizziness."This substantiates the conclusion that psychological mechanisms such as negative expectations about the treatment play a significant role in the side-effects breast cancer patients experience," said Nestoriuc. "Higher negative expectations, formed by patients before the start of their adjuvant therapy, seem to have a pronounced influence on long-term tolerability, especially once they are confirmed by initially high side-effects after three months."Nestouric's team are currently conducting a trial to assess whether strategies for improving women's expectations of treatment are effective. These include counselling and giving information on treatment that highlight's its benefits and also explains the possible effects that expectations can have.
Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe announced on Monday (22 August) that the voting rights of nearly 13,000 former criminals had their right to vote restored. The announcement was made during a civil rights memorial in Richmond."Restoring the rights of Virginians who have served their time and live, work and pay taxes in our communities is one of the pressing civil rights issues of our day," McAuliffe said in a statement, according to NBC News."I have met these men and women and know how sincerely they want to contribute to our society as full citizens again."The Democrat governor added that more former felons could be re-enfranchised in time for the presidential election in November. "I am not content to condemn them for eternity as inferior and second-class citizens," McAuliffe said, according to Reuters.The right restoration is just the latest chapter in an ongoing battle between McAuliffe and Republican lawmakers, NBC News noted. In April, McAuliffe issued an executive order to restore the voting rights of all Virginians who had completed their prison sentences, parole or probation.The order, which affected an estimated 206,000 Virginians, led state Republicans to sue and claim the move was a partisan effort to help Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. In July 2016, the Virginia Supreme Court ruled in favour of Republicans.McAuliffe's order was ruled unconstitutional and the court added the governor lacked the authority to issue a rights restoration order affecting all former felons at once. In response, McAuliffe said he would restore the rights individually to all eligible Virginians.However, NBC News reported that the newly re-enfranchised Virginians will need to register to vote a second time. McAuliffe said the state would deliver personalised rights restoration notifications and voter registration applications to the 13,000 people affected.John Whitbeck, chairman of the Virginia Republican Party, told Reuters that the party was always in favour of restoring the voting rights of former convicted criminals but on a case-by-case basis. "We're going to take a really long look at the individuals who had their rights restored, make sure he complied with the court order ... and from there decide what to do," he said.McAuliffe, however, remained committed to restoring the rights of the roughly 193,000 remaining former felons. He said that felons will be subjected to a "thorough review" involving more than a half dozen agencies, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported.The governor said restorations will be processed in order of those who have waited the longest. His administration will release a list of people whose rights have been restored the 15th of each month. "We will proceed," he told the crowd. "I will not stand down."
An increasing number of people are being smuggled into South Africa from Zimbabwe, according to a new report released on Monday (22 August), following "hundreds" of illegal entrants crossing between the two countries every day.The report, by the Democratic Alliance party, suggests that South Africa is a major player in human trafficking. Children as young as nine-years-old are prostituted are lured into the country with the promise of a better life and employment, according to South African website Health24.The report details how many of the people who become victims of smuggling are attempting to escape Robert Mugabe's oppressive regime, which ignored warnings by the United Nations World Food Programme that nearly 3 million of Zimbabwe 's 11 million people could starve to death.Many cross in to South Africa to buy household goods, fruit, vegetables and other commodities because of the economic crisis in Zimbabwe. The regime has recently seen new laws introduced in recent weeks which allow the government to seize mobile phones and laptops and listen in on private communications.Women who entered South Africa illegally were brought to Johannesburg by smugglers for a fee of 1,500 Rand (£84), according to Sky News.Once they have arrived, they are held in shacks by the traffickers until more money is handed over by relatives. They are raped and beaten if the cash is not forthcoming. One woman says she was held for three weeks and passed round as a prostitute until another Zimbabwean, "bought" her.She is now living in his shack as his "wife", adding: "He brings me food every day and looks after me and he's always looking for a job for me. I think one day I can learn to love him" the woman told Sky News.The tradition of ukuthwala, the enforced marriage of girls as young as 12 to men much older, is still practiced in remote villages in Eastern and Western Cape provinces, leaving girls as targets for sex slavery.
A record-breaking giant pearl, reportedly 1ft wide and 2.2 ft in length, has gone on display 10 years after it was first discovered off the coast of Palawan Island, Philippines in 2006. The £76m gem, which experts believe could be the biggest natural giant clam pearl in the world, was unveiled to the public for the first time on Monday (22 August).The enormous pearl was found by fisherman who cast down his anchor and it got wedged on a rock during a storm, said Tourism officer Aileen Cynthia Amurao. The find is thought to be five times larger than the previous record set by the Pearl of Allah."He noticed that it was lodged on a shell and swam down to pull up the anchor, and also brought the shell with him. This was a decade ago and he kept it at home."He didn't know how much it was worth and kept it tucked away at home as a simple good luck charm."We were amazed when he brought it to us. We now need help from gemologists to fully certify it. We're waiting for authentication from Gemologist Institute and other international authorities."But we believe Puerto Princesca is likely to earn another prestigious title and a record breaker for having the world's biggest natural giant pearl from a giant clam."We will keep this here in the Philippines and I hope it will bring more tourists to the city." However, the tourism officer added that she strongly discouraged locals from disturbing or removing giant clams from the sea as it adversely affects the biodiversity of Palawan, according to ITV News.The fisherman had no idea that the rare find was worth so much and left it under his bed for a decade. It was only when a fire at his house made him move out. He then handed it to a tourism officer in Puerto Princesca, who identified that it had originally come from a giant clam.Giant clams can reach over four feet in length and very rarely produce pearls, making this discovery extremely rare. The previous record holder - also known as the Pearl of Lao Tze - is worth $35m and weighs 6.4kg.

According to Sky News Number 10 said Prime Minister Theresa May wants to see their success recognised following an "amazing fortnight" in Brazil.The PM's official spokeswoman said: "We have had an amazing fortnight at the Rio Olympics and we should be looking at the differing ways that we can recognise and reward the athletes for all they have achieved, and honours are there to recognise and reward people."Mo Farah, who was awarded a CBE after his success at the London 2012 success, has said he would be thrilled to receive a knighthood after his "double double" triumph in Rio.
Three people have been injured in Brussels after a woman wielding a large knife, possibly a machete, reportedly attacked several passengers on a bus.The woman, who has not been identified, stabbed one person in the back and another in the stomach as they were getting off the vehicle in the Uccle area of the Belgian capital on Monday (22 August) at around 5pm local time.As armed police arrived at the scene, the woman fled to a nearby gallery. They confronted the suspect, who refused to comply. After several warnings she was shot in the arm and arrested Mail Online reports.Mayor Armand de Decker reportedly told local media: "When police arrived the person threatened an old lady with a knife wickedly. The police ordered her to drop the knife, she did not. They shot her in the arm, and that was it done."The assailant is said to have had a history of mental health problems and the police have so far, ruled out terrorism as a motive for the attack.Two people have been taken to hospital, one with serious and one with minor injuries. The area has been sealed off as an investigation into the incident gets underway. The bus route on which the attack took place has been suspended RT.com reports.Brussels has been on high alert following a spate of terror attacks in Paris last November and suicide bombings in Brussels in March. 32 people were killed when Islamic State(IS) supporters detonated nail bombs in Brussels Airport and a train station in the capital.
Chimpanzees are highly competitive between each other, almost as much as humans, scientists have revealed. However, like humans, the monkeys seem able to mitigate the negative effects of this competition by coming up with effective cooperation strategies.Competitive tendencies makes it a lot harder for members of a group to cooperate with each other and humans are often believed to be the only species capable of going beyond the competition that exists between them in order to cooperate. To make sure cooperation wins over competition, they resort to "enforcement strategies" – punishing freeloaders and choosing the partners they prefer to complete a cooperative tasks. In a new research paper published in the journal PNAS, scientists have shown that the ability to counter our competitive natures by promoting cooperation could be an ability we share with other primates, in particular with our closest relative, the chimpanzee. The study strongly suggests that humans are not an "anomaly in the animal kingdom", as it had previously been stated – rather showing that cooperation, both human and animal, rests on fundamentally similar principles such as mitigate competition and communicate shared goalsPulling for reward In the study, the scientists worked with 11 outdoor-housed chimpanzees. The animals were presented with a task in which two or three of them were required to pull an apparatus simultaneously in order to receive rewards.Crucially, the chimps were free to choose their partners, allowing opportunities for cooperation or freeloading. At first, competitiveness was high, with the monkeys trying to get food rewards for themselves individually. For instance, dominant individuals could claim specific spots at the apparatus and and bystanders could steal the food procured by others. 
In the experiment, the chimpanzees pulled together at a cooperation apparatus.Image courtesy of Frans de Waal, Yerkes National Primate Research CenterHowever, overall cooperative interactions were at least five times as likely as competitive interactions – a trend which is very similar to what happens in groups of humans. The scientists noted that the chimpanzees also resorted to enforcement strategies to improve cooperation. This included protest, aggression, or third-party intervention to punish the freeloader, as well as other strategies such as ceasing to pull until the freeloader departed or withdrawing from the apparatus. By the end of the study, interactions were almost entirely cooperative, highlighting the fact that humans are not the only one able to cooperate for the good of the collective. "Overall, our findings contrast sharply with reports of high levels of competition, low levels of tolerance, and harassment-induced food transfers among chimpanzees. The results suggest that chimpanzees can promote cooperation by inhibiting competition", the authors said.
Mine-clearing operations are taking place so residents can return after Iraqi forces backed by US-led coaltion air strikes recaptured the city from Islamic State in December.The Foreign Office said it had spoken with officials at Janus, a US contractor following the incident. "We are in contact with the employer of a British national who has died in Iraq and have offered our support at this difficult time," said a spokesman.The death was confirmed by the mayor of Ramadi according to AFP news agency, although he did not state the nationality of the wounded contractor.Scored of Iraqi civilians have been killed by incendiary devices and booby-traps left by IS (Daesh) as they tried to return to their homes in Ramadi and the rebuilding of the city can start."Daesh did not leave a metre on the ground in the city without planting in it explosives," Ahmad Rabih, an Anbar tribal official, said in a Guardian report. "That is what slowed down our heroes. They planted them in the streets and homes and shops. You have to blow them up from afar or they will blow you up."Janus Global Operations started working in Iraq during April after they won the contract to clear bombs and explosive devices planted around the area by Islamic militants. A spokesperson for Janus said: "Earlier today there was an incident in Ramadi at a worksite of Janus Global, the firm the [US] state department has engaged to clear that city of unexploded ordnance, abandoned explosive ordnance, and improvised explosive devices."The incident is under investigation, but what we can confirm is that sadly there was one fatality, a national of the United Kingdom. Another national of the United Kingdom suffered minor injuries. Until this investigation is more complete we will not be providing further information. At this point, our focus is on the family of our colleague and the health and safety of our team in the field."
The parents of a toddler feared dead after the family's boat capsized in a Florida river said their frantic search ended in a "miracle" after their daughter was found floating inside an air pocket beneath the vessel. Tammy and Brian Bossard lost sight of their 23-month-old child after they were thrown into the water when their boat hit a power line as they returned  home from dinner on the Indian River on Friday (19 August).They managed to escape with their seven-month-old daughter Charlotte, but desperately searched the water in the pitch black for a sign of their other daughter, Kennedy."I woke up in the water holding Charlotte, and I woke up right next to the boat and I saw a hole in the side of the boat, and climbed on top and shoved Charlotte up there," Tammy Bossard told Kare 11 News.A frantic call to 911 saw her tell the operator: "I'm in the river. My boat crashed and I have a baby still in the water. Please God send someone now... please hurry."Four officers jumped into the water to rescue the family and try and find the toddler. They reported hearing cries but couldn't locate where they were coming from.After nearly an hour's search deputies were ready to give up, fearing the young girl had drowned. "We were just getting ready to leave and that's when we heard a very light cry," Cpl. Alan Worthy of the Cocoa Police Department said. "I put my ear up to the side of the boat and I was listening and I could hear that she was right there."Kennedy was found floating in her life vest in an air pocket beneath the boat – something officers say undoubtedly saved her life. "Usually incidents like this don't turn out like that," officers Matthew Rush said. "A boating accident that severe with that much damage could have been a lot worse. Air pocket in the boat and a life jacket saved her life."After being rescued Kennedy spent two nights at a local hospital and is now home. "We thought we were going to lose her... It's a complete miracle that everything worked like it did, because we shouldn't all be here today," Tammy said.
X-Men: Apocalypse certainly had its fair share of classic Marvel Comics characters, with the likes of James McAvoy, Jennifer Lawrence and Michael Fassbender reprising roles from previous movies and newbies Kodi Smit-McPhee and Sophie Turner joining the ranks.Star Wars: The Force Awakens actor Oscar Isaac is now playing this instalment's titular villain and it's emerging that another, established baddie, nearly made a reappearance: Peter Dinklage's Dr Bolivar Trask.First spotted by Comicbook.com, recently revealed concept art by Canadian illustrator Bartol Rendulic sees several designs conjured up for an ankle bracelet, with Trask's name written at the bottom of every image.Most commonly associated with people on house arrest, ankle bracelets – or monitors such as this – are often worn when imprisoned criminals are on parole or taken out of confinement to be questioned / moved etc. A notion which certainly ties in with cinema-goers' last sighting of Trask...In X-Men's Days Of Future Past, inventor and businessman Trask creates an army of advanced, mutant-hunting robots named Sentinels that eventually became so powerful – having absorbed a number of the X-Men's powers – that they attempt to take over Earth. The film saw Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to unite younger versions of themselves, and other 1970s mutants, to stop Trask from ever making them in the first place.Towards the end of the movie, Trask is arrested due to the corrupt nature of his Sentinel programme (that and the fact they kill a number people outside the White House). He is later seen – during a mid-credit scene on the Rogue Cut Blu-ray – sitting in a prison cell underneath the Pentagon; the same cell Magneto was kept in when arrested for his involvement in the John F. Kennedy assassination. It would therefore make perfect sense if Trask is being monitored ten years down the line.What this has to do with X-Men: Apocalypse's storyline, however, is anyone's guess... Although it could be possible that the government was going to bring Trask in to help stop Apocalypse after the all-powerful mutant sent all of the world's nuclear weapons into space. Perhaps they believed that their only chance against him was to resurrect the Sentinels, or perhaps we will never find out...For more entertainment news follow A-List on Twitter @Alistinsider
A Gambian opposition member has died while he was in detention, the country's main opposition party, the United Democratic Party (UDP), has claimed. Solo Krummah, UDP's deputy chairman of the Sandu Constituency, died after being admitted at the Edward Francis's Small Teaching Hospital in the capital Banjul.  Krummah was admitted to hospital on 8 August under armed guard. He was arrested on 9 May during protests that called for electoral reforms and the resignation of Gambian President, Yahya Jammeh, who has been in power since 1994.Authorities claimed the protest was illegal as demonstrators had failed to obtain permission from the police and at least 50 people were arrested. "The lawyers have been consulted and will act accordingly to get to the cause of the death of Solo and for the body to be given to the party and family for a fitting burial," the UPD was quoted by Reuters as saying. Both the government and the Edward Francis Hospital have not yet commented on UDP's claims.Krummah is the second UDP member to have died while being in detention. UDP secretary Solo Sandeng is believed to also have died while in custody. He was arrested in April when anti-government protests first erupted. Earlier in July, UDP leader Ousainou Darboe and 18 other people were sentenced to three years in jail after being arrested for taking part in the April protest. The defendants were found guilty of participating in the unauthorised protest which occurred near the capital Banjul.
Reasons behind Gambia protestsIn power since 1994, President Yahya Jammeh has been accused of undermining an effective opposition by raising the costs to register a political party.Under the new law, anyone who wants to register a political party or run as presidential candidate has to pay 500,000 dalasis (£8,240, $11,870). Critics argue it undermines pluralism in the economically-stagnant country, where nearly 50% of the population still live in poverty.The government said the law was necessary to ensure parties were properly organised. However, protesters are calling for electoral changes and the stepping down of Jammeh.More on protests in Gambia here.Government's positionIn a public address to the nation on 18 May 2016, Jammeh defined members of the Gambian opposition as "opportunistic people supported by the West".He added: "I will bow to only Allah and my mother. I will never tolerate opposition to destabilise this country."Earlier in May, Samsudeen Sarr, Gambia's deputy ambassador to the UN – based in New York – was recorded while saying he would open fire on protesters in Banjul."If I were there, and I was in charge, I would open fire on anybody," the diplomat said. The clip surfaced on 9 May, hours after activists and the opposition claimed security forces attacked people who had gathered outside the High Court in Banjul, as Darboe had appeared for a court ruling.Sarr accused the person who secretly recorded him of doctoring the audio, having released just a few seconds of a two-hour-long conversation. He also claimed people behind the protests were "anti-Gambia government dissidents" in the US and Europe who aimed to overthrow the government which, he said, had been overwhelmingly voted into office. He also rejected allegations that Sandeng died in custody.

The decision comes after the six-time Olympic gold medallist apologised for "over-exaggerating" claims he and teammates Gunnar Bentz, Jack Conger and Jimmy Feigen were the victims of an armed robbery following a party in Rio de Janeiro on 14 August.

Initial suggestions over a robbery were countered by the Brazilian authorities, who found no evidence after viewing surveillance footage and claimed that the swimmers were in fact being asked by security guards to pay for damages inflicted upon a petrol station bathroom. "Speedo USA today announces the decision to end its sponsorship of Ryan Lochte," the company confirmed in an official statement released on Monday afternoon. "As part of this decision, Speedo USA will donate a $50,000 portion of Lochte's fee to Save The Children, a global charity partner of Speedo USA's parent company, for children in Brazil."While we have enjoyed a winning relationship with Ryan for over a decade and he has been an important member of the Speedo team, we cannot condone behaviour that is counter to the values that this brand has long stood for. We appreciate his many achievements and hope he moves forward and learns from this experience."In a recent emotional interview with NBC's The Today Show host Matt Lauer, Lochte, who has also issued a lengthy apology on social media, took full responsibility for the incident and admitted that he had over-exaggerated the story while condemning his own immature and intoxicated behaviour. He said he was "truly, 110% sorry" to "the gas station owner, to Brazilian police, to the people of Rio and Brazil, everyone that came together to put on these wonderful games".The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has formed a disciplinary committee to investigate the bizarre saga, while United States Olympic Committee (USOC) CEO Scott Blackmun recently hinted that additional disciplinary measures may be forthcoming."They let down our athletes," he said. "They let down Americans. And they really let down our hosts in Rio who did such a wonderful job, and we feel very badly about that. I think we ended up in the right place in terms of being able to shine a light on what really happened there.''UPDATE - Another of Lochte's main sponsors, Ralph Lauren, have now revealed that they will not be seeking to renew their deal."Ralph Lauren continues to proudly sponsor the US Olympic and Paralympic team and the values that its athletes embody," they said, as per CNBC Now. "Ralph Lauren's endorsement agreement with Ryan Lochte was specifically in support of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games and the company will not be renewing his contract."
Frank Ocean is likely to join the impressive competition at the Grammys 2017. With the release of his second studio album Blonde, Ocean is now eligible to receive a nomination at next year's awards. This means the Nikes singer could go up against the critically-acclaimed albums released by Beyonce and Adele.Blonde, the follow-up to Ocean's debut Channel Orange, was released on 20 August exclusively via Apple Music and iTunes. The new record features an impressive host of uncredited collaborations with the likes of Beyonce, Kendrick Lamar, Andre 3000, James Blake and Kim Burrell rearing their heads.The album's release date means there is a strong possibility it could receive a Grammy nomination later in 2016. According to the Grammys website, the eligibility period runs from 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2016. With a month to go until the deadline, Ocean, 28, was certainly cutting it fine but made a timely swoop much to the delight of fans who are calling for the album to win the Grammy.Ocean's potential nomination has strengthened the race in the prestigious album of the year category. Beyonce is also a front runner to receive a nod and eventually claim the award with sixth studio album Lemonade.Released in April, the LP garnered much attention due to the hour-long visual album which premiered on HBO, wide-ranging sonic themes amidhints of Jay Z's infidelity.Also in the running is British songstress Adele with her comeback album 25. The Someone Like You singer's third LP dropped in November 2015 and has gone on to sell more than 20 million copies worldwide.
Frank Ocean is eligible to receive a nomination at the Grammys 2017 with his second album BlondeJason Merritt/Getty ImagesOneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder has written songs for both singers, including Remedy which appears on Adele's 25. Addressing the pop rivalry at the upcoming Grammys, Tedder previously told IBTimes UK: "Stop being b*****s. Stop creating controversy when there's no controversy. They're both amazing they're both completely different. I hate that s**t. Screw the b*****s that start those wars. Go get a day job."The nominations for the 59th Grammys are traditionally announced just before Christmas although a date is yet to be announced.In the meantime, fans are enjoying Ocean's Blonde and the visual album Endless which premiered on 19 August and also hosts new music. Opening up about his new material for the first time, Ocean wrote on Tumblr: "I found it romantic, sometimes, editing this project. The whole time I felt as though I was in the presence of a $16m McLaren F1 armed with a disposable camera.
Beyonce's sixth album Lemonade is a strong contender for an album of the year nomination at the Grammys 2017Parkwood/Columbia"My memories are in these pages, places closeby and long ass-numbing flights away. Recording in Tokyo, NYC, Miami, LA, London, Paris. Stopping in Berlin to witness Berghain for myself. Trading jewels and soaking in parables with the many-headed Brandon aka BasedGod in conversation."He added in another Tumblr post: "I had the time of my life making all of this. Thank you all. Especially those of you who never let me forget I had to finish. Which is basically every one of ya'll. Haha. Love you."Blonde was previously titled Boys Don't Cry. The singer's first album Channel Orange was nominated in the album of the year category at the 2013 Grammys but lost out to Mumford & Sons' Babel.
A popular rapper from Los Angeles was shot and killed at a pool party held in a multi-million dollar mansion on Saturday night (22 August). Police said two other men were shot in the incident but are expected to survive.Rapper Kid Cali, real name Justin Lishey, was rushed to hospital where he was pronounced dead. The shooter ran out of the party and into the surrounding area, according to police. A description has not yet been released.Friends of Lishey told ABC 11 that they could not understand why anyone would want to shoot him. "He's a great person, he has a good heart and he's going to be missed," said closed friend Dorthea DeVilla, "He's going to be missed, not just by me, but by everybody."DeVilla also told the news station that friends had seen Lishey involved in an altercation at some point during the evening. More than 100 people were at the party, which was advertised on social media. Attendees were expected to pay an entrance fee.Tributes to musician, believed to be 30-years-old,  came in from a number of well known stars. Singer, Chris Brown, tweeted "RIP KID CALI".While Snoop Dogg shared a picture of the rapper on Instagram, captioning it with "rest well young g".
A statement has surfaced online reportedly written by disgruntled privacy advocates calling for a 24-hour blackout of the Tor Network. This is in protest against the handling of a sexual misconduct investigation into prominent community member and digital activist Jacob Appelbaum.In a statement initially posted to GhostBin and since circulated on social media platforms, the Tor Strike – as it has been labelled – makes a number of demands on the recently-announced board of directors and users of the anonymity network around the world."Please join our 24-hour Tor blackout on Thursday, 1 September 2016. Use your local time or UTC+02:00," the statement reads. It pleads for users of Tor to not use the platform and urges developers to shut down or stop working on its infrastructure.Alongside the Appelbaum case, the statement highlights recent controversy over the hiring of a former intelligence agency official by The Tor Project – a non-profit organisation set up to oversee the management of the network and maintain its security."Tor can no longer be trusted after #jakegate / #torgate and hire of CIA," the statement continues. "Its sinking credibility is putting people at risk. We hope it can be healed and regain trust with mass action. A short blackout may hurt in the short term, but save Tor in the long term. It will also allow dissenting voices to be heard."In a series of 16 demands, the strike action notice called for the resignation of current executive director Shari Steele and for all newly elected members to "reveal their connection to the Appelbaum investigation."In demands focused on the hiring policies of those working on the development of Tor, it calls on anyone with links to intelligence agencies to "sever all ties" with Tor and its related groups.
What is Tor?"The Tor network is a group of volunteer-operated servers that allows people to improve their privacy and security on the Internet. Tor's users employ this network by connecting through a series of virtual tunnels rather than making a direct connection, thus allowing both organisations and individuals to share information over public networks without compromising their privacy."Read more here."This includes anyone who introduced intelligence workers or people with security clearance in the Five Eyes countries, current or former," it continues. "We know from IRC logs that Tor Project staff knew of a CIA hire on at least one occasion and kept it secret. Some advocated for the hire, at length."The social-media reception to the strike notice has been overwhelming negative. "Don't fall for #TorStrike scam," tweeted software developer Kitty Hundal. "Just a lame attempt to deflect attention away from the exposures of Tor accusers [and] to inflame.""I agree with the reasons some of you want #torstrike," wrote information security expert Marie Gutbub, who recently publicly criticised the Tor Project for its probe in Appelbaum. "But please remember that you will harm @torproject users worldwide if you do this."Meanwhile, prominent privacy researcher Sarah Jamie Lewis wrote: "If you want to make the anonymity space better: increase the diversity of funding (and the funds!) to multiple independent [organisations]. Anonymity networks have real problems, more research and funding will actually fix things."Previously, the Tor Project released an official report 'confirming' accusations against Appelbaum, who has previously worked with whistleblowing outfit WikiLeaks. Executive director Shari Steele released a statement noting that many people had spoken out about "incidents of being humiliated, intimidated, bullied and frightened" by the former researcher."Several experienced unwanted sexually aggressive behaviour from him," she added. "Some of those incidents have been shared publicly, and some have not. The investigation also identified two additional people as having engaged in inappropriate conduct, and they are no longer involved with the Tor Project."According to Gizmodo, more information on the results of the inquiry were handed exclusively to the New York Times.
Lockheed Martin's new F-35 Lightning II fighter jet is being hailed as the world's most advanced tactical aircraft and a new technological era for aerial warfare. It's been 15-years in the making, each cost nearly $90 million, and after being plagued with setbacks has recently been declared ready for combat. While the plane itself is something to marvel, the helmets its pilots wear are also taking things to the next-generation.Inside the cockpit of the advanced F-35A Lightning II, pilots will be stepping into the future as they literally plug themselves into the plane through a revolutionary new helmet that lets them sense everything that's going on during missions, projecting information on to a display in front of their eyes.Designed by avionics and electronics experts at Rockwell Collins, the state-of-the-art F-35 Gen III Helmet Mounted Display System provides pilots with a 360-degree view around the plane's exterior by projecting live video feeds from the external cameras on to the helmet's lens. This technology, called Distributed Aperture System, or DAC, is a revolutionary step for the modern-day fighter pilot and will replace a traditional heads-up display screen in cockpits for the first time in 50 years.In what would make the average person quickly go green with nausea, skilled pilots are able to turn their heads and 'see-through' their plane during combat in order to help see enemy planes or targets – all while flying their jet at speed. As well as useful in combat situations it will help increase safety as it allows pilots to quickly see horizons and know where the ground is during dizzying manoeuvres. Night vision is also built into the helmet, with a zoom function to improve situational awareness and eye threats or targets on the ground.
Fighter pilots step into the future with revolutionary new helmet that lets them 'see through' their jetRockwell CollinsThe helmets are custom built to fit each pilot's head, with each individual having to undergo a laser scanning 3D measurement procedure to ensure the fit is spot on. Any movement or wiggle from an ill-fitting helmet could severely affect a pilot's accuracy through the HMDS during potentially life-threatening situations.The virtual heads-up display also will serve up a platter of critical information including airspeed, altitude, targeting information, video recording and picture-in-picture capability. You may ask why video recording is on the feature list; air forces aren't jumping on-board the YouTube revolution – it's to allow personnel to dissect and debrief missions and help with fighter-pilot training."It's absolutely where we need to go for taking the fight to the enemy, particularly in tomorrow's wars as the enemy continues to get more and more advanced. The fifth-generation aspects, the stealth and the sensor tech is going to allow us to operate in a very contested environment, to where we will have a difficult time getting there with some of the legacy platforms like the F-16," Major Jayson Rickard told Fox News, who got hands on with the next-gen equipment.

It also offers night vision, removing the need for pilots to wear traditional heavy night-vision technology.Lockheed Martin is making three versions of the new, fifth-generation fighter jet. There will be the F-35A, F-35B and F-35C. The new aircraft are being coveted for enhanced computer networking systems and stealth capabilities, as well as the F-35B's ability to take-off vertically. The new planes are being snapped up by air forces from the US, Great Britain, Australia and more.
Days before WikiLeaks unleashed 20,000 emails from the Democratic National Committee (DNC), a little-known website purporting to have been set up by "American hacktivists" was already releasing troves of stolen political documents into the public domain.In an operation that remains somewhat under-the-radar, the project, DCLeaks, has released information on everyone from Hillary Clinton to high-ranking military officials. Despite claims to the contrary, experts believe it's simply another front being used by Russian intelligence.While the ultimate objective and internal structure of the organisation remains unclear, mounting analysis from cybersecurity firms has linked DCLeaks to both Guccifer 2.0 and Fancy Bear, a Kremlin-affiliated hacking group believed to have infiltrated the DNC.On its website, a statement reads: "DCLeaks is a new level project aimed to analyse and publish a large amount of emails from top-ranking officials and their influence agents all over the world."It continues: "The project was launched by the American hacktivists who respect and appreciate freedom of speech, human rights and government of the people."What's on the website? At the time of writing, DCLeaks is host to information on a range of victims – from both sides of the political divide. Portfolios include Bill and Hillary Clinton, DNC official William Rinehart, former NATO commander General Philip Breedlove and a Democratic Party-linked PR professional called Sarah Hamilton.Each folder contains a description of the targeted group or individual, alongside a list of their hacked emails in a searchable format. As noted by ThreatConnect, a cybersecurity firm that has analysed the website in detail, most of the descriptions are directly lifted from other websites, including Wikipedia.To date, the biggest revelations from the website revolve around George Soros, Democratic Party supporter and founder of the philanthropic Open Society Foundations. Released on 13 August, the leak boasted pilfered internal files that totalled a significant 1.51GB in size – including funding reports, contracts and confidential briefing memos.The first postings date back to April – roughly two months before the first DNC revelations emerged. The main bulk of the disclosures, however, did not start until June – lining up neatly with the emergence of a self-described hacker known as Guccifer 2.0. Yet unlike the initial DNC disclosures, the DCLeaks files do not appear to directly relate to the upcoming presidential election.So, where's the Russia connection? When ThreatConnect analysed the shadowy links between hacking group Fancy Bear, leaker (and possible Russian intelligence figure) Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks, suspicions were quickly raised that everything was connected.As outlined in a blog post, the firm was able to link the type of spearphishing emails used to break into to the email account of William Rinehart directly to a Russian email address used by Fancy Bear hackers. Furthermore, the web domain of DCLeaks was registered with the Romanian THCServers – which has also been linked to Fancy Bear in the past."Why would the supposed 'American hacktivists' behind DCLeaks choose this seemingly random, small, Romanian registrar to register their domain?" said ThreatConnect. "Is it merely coincidence that DCLeaks uses the same name server as other domains that are associated with Fancy Bear?"
Pictured: Screenshot from DCLeaks website, suspected to be the work of Russian intelligenceDCLeaks/ScreenshotGuccifer 2.0 – who has claimed to have links with Romania – previously told IBTimes UK he was working alongside DCLeaks, but maintained he was not part of its main operation. "This isn't my work, they gave me password-protected access," the hacker said at the time while providing access to a password-protected file.In any case, ThreatConnect believes the website is yet another example of a "Russian influence operation" that will give hackers a new platform to leak politically sensitive documents. "Such operations may ultimately help Russia sway public opinion or media coverage in a way that benefits Moscow," it said.Officials close to the Kremlin have consistently denied any role in the hacks. In the US, the Obama administration has not yet pointed the finger directly at Russia, however the FBI recently expanded its investigation after finding 'more than 100' political figures' had likely been breached. The leaks are not limited to one political party, and fears are growing within the Republican party that it may have been compromised.While Guccifer 2.0 continues to leak documents, the DCLeaks website has been less than active. Its last post was on 13 August and the organisation's social media presence – which is also decidedly pro-Russia in its leaning – has been sparse. IBTimes UK contacted the website administrators for comment, but had received no response at the time of publication.
Britney Spears will reclaim her pop princess crown with the release of her ninth studio album Glory. The Slave 4 U hitmaker has spent almost three years dazzling the masses in Las Vegas but fresh music is finally on its way.Glory will be Spears' first album since Britney Jean was released in November 2013.With more than 100 million records sold worldwide throughout her career, Spears, 34, certainly does not need to release any new music. Which is why Glory may just be her most experimentative body of work to date. Spears has remained coy on details thus far but she did tell one Twitter follower: "I'll just say this... We really explored some new things."A lot of passion and time was, of course, ploughed into creating Glory. Sharing a glimpse into her creative process, Spears told Ryan Seacrest: "It's kind of like my baby and I took it very seriously. There were some parts where it was just kind of hard because I wanted things to be so good and it's like, when you're writing, sometimes you just have days where you suck."Spears' return to recording is one of the most anticipated pop comebacks in 2016 so as fans prepare, IBTimes UK rounds up all the important information you need to know about Glory.Release dateGlory is set for release on Friday 26 August 2016 via Apple Music where you can also pre-order a copy. Get the date in your diary!TracklistGlory should be filler-free with the tracklist modestly spanning 12 songs.Watch Britney Spears' Make Me music video:

The lyricist features on the album's sultry lead single Make Me which has fast become a fan-favourite, creating a strong buzz for the LP. The album may be thin on collaborations but the writing and production credits make up for this. Those listed and their previous work include:
Glory will be Britney Spears' first album since beginning her Las Vegas residency in December 2013Kevin Winter/Getty ImagesTalay Riley – written for Chris Brown, Nick JonasCashmere Cat – produced for Kanye WestJulia Michaels – written for Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato, Fifth Harmony, Kelly ClarksonEd Drewett – written for One DirectionSinglesMake Me proved to be such a hit with fans that a petition was launched for the original music video to be released. Whereas Make Me takes a steer for the sensual, the second single Private Show is cheeky and bold with Spears sounding more confident than ever.SoundSince her partnership with Pharrell Williams in the early noughties, Spears' music has always had a tinge of r'n'b. According to the pop star, Glory is the furthest she has ever ventured down the urban route. Spears told Ryan Seacrest: "It took a lot of time but I think we brought it to a level where I was really, really happy with what I had. It's cool, it's really different. I think this is probably the most hip hop album."She added: "Not most – there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I've wanted to do for a long time now, and I just haven't really done that... It's a really good record, and I'm very, very proud of it."
He may have only just wrapped production on Fast 8, but actor Dwayne Johnson is already looking forward to his next project Jumanji, in which he will reunite with Central Intelligence co-star Kevin Hart and Kung Fu Panda's Jack Black.And, just to clarify for those who believe so, it's not a reboot of the 1995 movie, which starred the late Robin Williams and Kirsten Dunst: it's actually a sequel, of sorts..."For the record we are NOT making a reboot, but rather a continuation of the awesome Jumanji story," Johnson told his 63.5 million followers on Instagram over the weekend while commemorating the end of Fast 8 filming with a photograph of him about to board a private aeroplane."It's also crazy to me how much me, Kev and Jack look like triplets when we're together. Man this is gonna be FUN."The original film was loosely adapted Van Allsburg's adventure novel, and told the story of two children who let loose a man trapped for decades in a board game. Unfortunately, they also unleash a jungle's worth of creatures into the world, and have to find a way to reverse what they've done and get the world back to normal.The new film, which is scheduled to start shooting in two weeks time, is set to be directed by film-maker (and son of Star Wars veteran screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan) Jake Kasdan. The 41-year-old has previously helmed pictures such as Bad Teacher and Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story as well as TV series The Grinder, all of which have targeted significantly different audiences than the original children-orientated Jumanji movie. However, with Hart, Black and Johnson at the forefront, it already seems likely that the film will lend itself to a more mature viewer.At the moment, Jumanji is expected to reach both UK and US cinemas on 28 July 2017. Singer Nick Jonas, who has previously acted in Camp Rock and television series Scream Queens, will also star.For more entertainment news follow A-List on Twitter @Alistinsider
Kensington Palace have announced details and dates regarding the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's upcoming Canada tour via a string of posts on their official Twitter profile. Prince William and Kate Middleton – who have been married since 2011 and have two children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte – will set off from 24 September until 1 October.Many glamorous outfit choices will undoubtedly be expected from the Duchess during their stay and royal watchers may be expecting to see some of Kate's go-to designers including Jenny Packham and Alexander McQueen among her high-street favourite brands such as Reiss.The royal couple will visit Vancouver, Victoria, Bella Bella, Haida Gwaii and Kelowna in British Columbia, followed by Whitehorse and Carcross in Yukon.It has not yet been confirmed if Prince George, three, and one-year-old Princess Charlotte will join their parents on tour.George accompanied William and Kate for their tour of Australia and New Zealand in 2014 when he was just eight months old, but the couple did not bring their children to India and Bhutan this past April. Kensington Palace will announce plans concerning the young royals nearer the time.The palace tweeted last month: "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will visit Canada this autumn at the invitation of the Canadian Government. TRH hold very happy memories from their last visit to Canada in 2011 – their first overseas tour as a married couple."Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's Tour Outline:

Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy revealed that he will run to be leader of the country again in the 2017 elections.Sarkozy served as president between 2007 and 2012, and made the announcement on his social media pages ahead of the publication of his book, Everything for France."I have decided to be a candidate for the 2017 presidential election."I felt I had the strength to lead this battle at a troubled time in our history," he wrote.Sarkozy, leader of the centre right Les Republicains, has previously hinted that retains ambitions to be president.More than a dozen candidates are vying for the party's presidential nomination. In recent polls Sarkozy trailed his main rival, Alain Juppe.He was defeated in elections four years ago by Socialist leader Francois Hollande, whose government is increasingly unpopular following a series of terror attacks by Islamic extremists, and controversial reform policies.In November, both France's main parties will hold presidential elections, in which party members will vote for a candidate in a two round ballot.
American welterweight contender Errol Spence Jr is hopeful of facing Kell Brook after continuing his upward momentum with a dominant victory over Leonard Bundu in a title eliminator on Sunday night (21 August). 'The Truth', a former Olympian who stopped Chris Algieri earlier this year, secured a crushing knockout of his veteran Italian opponent in round six at Brooklyn's Ford Amphitheater to become the mandatory challenger for the IBF title.Brook is somewhat preoccupied at the moment, with the Sheffield lad now less than three weeks away from jumping two divisions for the biggest fight of his career to date against feared Kazakh KO specialist and pound-for-pound king Gennady Golovkin in London.Undisputed middleweight champion Triple G's WBA Super, WBC and IBF belts will be on the line in that high-profile clash, which also offers Brook the chance to claim bragging rights over domestic rival Amir Khan following the latter's defeat to Saul "Canelo" Alvarez."I want a shot at Kell Brook as soon as he's done with GGG," southpaw Spence was quoted as saying by ESPN after maintaining his 100% professional record, a 21-0 tally that includes 18 KOs. "If he's not going to fight me, he needs to vacate and I'll fight somebody else. But I definitely want that IBF title shot this year."The IBF is typically strict when it comes to enforcing these title defences, with Tyson Fury stripped of the heavyweight strap he sensationally took from Wladimir Klitschko in December 2015 after neglecting to face Vyacheslav Glazkov due to ongoing negotiations over a rematch.Brook, who initially won his title with a majority decision triumph over Shawn Porter in August 2014, also saw off three consecutive mandatories inside a year after defeating Jo Jo Dan, Frankie Gavin and Kevin Bizier. The ease of such victories – "Special K" was not taken past six rounds in any of the three contests – has led to question marks over his ability to compete against big-name opponents, something that he will hope to put to rest against Golovkin.In the likely event that he loses that fight, a rising star such as Spence Jr would surely represent a massive step up from those previous mandatories.
 Way back in May 2009, Canada and the European Union (EU), started negotiations on a bilateral trade deal at a special EU – Canada summit in Prague, the proposed agreement to be called the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA). Today, in late August 2016, CETA is all "done and dusted" but has yet to come into force.Surely a time frame of over seven years should have been enough to iron out all contentious issues, especially when one considers that CETA was supposed to be the culmination of talks and approaches initiated way, way back at two previous summits in Ottawa, the first in December 2002 and then when an agreed framework was reached in March 2004.The 2004 Ottawa talks were expected to iron out the terms for the Trade and Investment Enhancement Agreement (TIEA). Packed with good proposals for the benefit of all as befits these fine sounding potential treaties, work continued on this project until 2006 when a mutually agreed "pause" in deliberations came into effect.Collectively, the then 25-member EU, represented Canada's most important trade and investment partner after the United States, with two-way merchandise trade of C$70 billion and two-way direct investment of C$214 billion (2005 figures).Wide ranging, the scope of TIEA included "mutual recognition of professional qualifications, financial services, e-commerce, temporary entry...sustainable development, and science and technology". All these had been covered, plus government procurement, sometimes a sensitive topic, without apparently any serious issue, by the third round negotiations in Ottawa between 20 and 23 February 2006.On the domestic front, after April 2003, the Government of Canada started consultations with various civilian bodies and the provincial and territorial governments and in 2005 started a Strategic Environmental Assessment to include all of these groups, on the implications of TIEA.What went wrong?! A few points can be noted. It appears that neither the Canadian Government nor the European Commission initiated the Agreement, possibly getting it off to a slow start.The TIEA was a project by the Canada Europe Roundtable of Business, "CERT", an association of Canadian and European companies founded in 1999 with the aim of influencing the Government of Canada and the European Commission, so as to establish "dynamic transatlantic" bilateral trade and investment free of barriers.Yet despite well-known members like Alcan, Bombardier, Siemens and Deloitte playing prominent roles with regular meetings and briefs between all private member bodies, and the adoption of the project by Ottawa and Brussels acting through relevant government departments, the very existence of TIEA remained widely unknown throughout Canada and Europe. One gets the feeling that this was particularly true in that all important economic sector of small and medium sized businesses.Another issue came to light in a survey by CERT of business leaders who had some knowledge of the TIEA initiative, CERT found that 90 per cent of respondents felt that emphasis on tariff barriers was not the big issue and much more the need to eradicate non-tariff barriers.Canada's federal system meant that Ottawa had to liaise and seek the cooperation of the provincial and territorial governments, whilst the EU Commission had to do likewise with those of the member states – a task not to be underestimated given the multiple objectives, complexity of issues , and trade relation priorities. At this time, British Columbia as an example, concentrated on Far East trade and was prospering whilst Newfoundland was facing recession (or worse) due to the manmade ecological disaster of the collapse of the Grand Banks Cod Fishery.Last though not least, Canada's economy being closely integrated with that of the United States, required both parties to harmonise their bilateral proposed legislation with what already existed and continued to arise in Canadian-US codes and practices.A real world example of this was brought up by the Toronto Star as the new CETA agreement was supposed to be in the final lap, in an April 2014 piece, asking: "...whether Canadian-exported cars with a mix of Canadian and United States parts are eligible for tariff reductions under CETA?"After late 2006, TIEA was allowed to wither on the vine. There had been bilateral agreements between the EU and Canada both before, during and since the TIEA negotiations – Customs Cooperation (1997), Veterinary Agreement (1999), Wine and Spirits (2003), Civil Aviation Safety (2009), to name a few, but nothing of such scope.Both sides however, started "initial" talks on joint studies at a Berlin Summit in June 2007, which by October 2011 had lasted nine rounds and in 2012, both sides agreed these talks be given "priority" status! September 2014 saw "the leaders release the completed text of the (CETA) Agreement" and February this year, the legal review of the text.The Government of Canada's latest forecast is that CETA will bring a 20 per cent boost to bilateral trade with the EU and an increase of C$12 billion in the country's GDP. Although the Agreement is far more ranging that trade, the website gives it pride of place:"Did you know?Of the EU's more than 9,000 tariff lines, approximately 98 per cent will be duty free on the very first day the Canada – EU agreement comes into force. By comparison, only 29 per cent of tariff lines were duty-free on the first day that NAFTA took effect."Looks like Canada is all set to go! There's widespread approval and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau heads a big Liberal majority and would be able to come to Brussels after the European Council meets on 20 -21 October to sign on the dotted line.Great! At long last!Well, maybe not. Apparently, at least six countries in the EU have issues with parts of the Agreement and might delay, if not block ratification. Britain, after Article 50 is triggered, be warned.I suppose there's always another year.
The Libyan peace process has taken a backwards step with the country's democratically elected House of Representatives passing a vote of no confidence in its internationally recognised, UN-backed government.Libya has been engulfed in chaos since the ousting of 40-year dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, but the country's UN backed peace process hopes to remedy a two-year-long political crisis that erupted when militias forced the House of Representatives to flee the capital.Since August 2014, expanding anarchy in Libya has provided a breeding ground for the Islamic State (Isis) and allowed the black market trade in guns, petrol and people to flourish.The Government of National Accord was the result of seemingly interminable UN-backed talks, which created a unity government under Fayez Serraj, now installed in Tripoli.The spokesman for the House of Representatives Abdullah Ablahig said 61 lawmakers voted against the government, 39 abstained and one voted to support it, with enough members to reach a quorum. Questions have been raised over the validity of the vote. One pro-government lawmaker told the Associated Press his parliamentary colleagues had not been made aware of the vote.While it is not clear what happens next, and whether the Serraj government can make any claim to legitimacy, the vote is a blow to the international community's efforts to purge IS from Libya.The international community has said it will only cooperate with a unity government in Libya to achieve strategic aims. US airstrikes have hit Isis positions in the Isis stronghold of Sirte, with British and US special forces deployed on the ground.Militias, predominantly from the costal Libyan town of Misrata and fighting under the auspices of the Government of National Accord, claim to have all but liberated Sirte. At one point there were thousands of Isis militants in the town, according to UN and US estimates. It was believed to be a fall-back position for Isis as its territory was eroded in the Levant.

The lavish superyacht 'Equanimity' linked to Malaysian businessman Jho Low has sailed into Hong Kong waters, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The newspaper said while there has been speculation that the yacht, which is among the largest in the world, is to be sold, the purpose of its stay in Hong Kong is not clear.
"And no one connected to it is willing to talk," it added.
SCMP contacted Northrop & Johnson, a Hong Kong-based broker for superyachts, but the firm declined to comment.
One of its sales brokers told the publication that the company had a confidentiality agreement with the client.
"The client does not want any publicity," said the broker.
According to SCMP, the yachting press often cited Jho Low as the owner of the vessel, but his lawyers have denied this.
"Even so, the yacht appears to be at his disposal and he has hosted a number of lavish parties on board with Hollywood stars, such as Leonardo DiCaprio.
"The last of these was reportedly a birthday bash off the coast of South Korea in November 2015," the newspaper reported.
The report stated that 'Equanimity' has a crew of 28 and can accommodate 26 guests in a master suite, three VIP rooms, three doubles and two twin staterooms.
It features a spa/beach club with a sauna, steam room, "experiential shows", a plunge pool, beauty salon and gym.
It also has a 20-metre swimming pool, and is one of the few superyachts with a helipad.
SCMP said it is understood that the yacht underwent maintenance or repair work, and spent much of its time in Hong Kong at the Yiu Lian dockyard on Tsing Yi.
"But a manager at the dockyard said he was unable to discuss 'Equanimity', since his company had also been required to sign a confidentiality agreement," it added.
According to a report in SuperYacht Fan, US$175 million 'Equanimity' was built by the Netherlands-based Oceanco and was delivered to her owner in June 2014.
The yacht has a length of 91.5 metres and is built of steel, with an aluminum superstructure, while the interior has some oriental-inspired themes, using materials as wenge, bamboo and gold lead.
A check by Malaysiakini with Marine Traffic today placed the current location of 'Equanimity' in the South China area about 200 kilometres east of Hong Kong, having departed the island yesterday.
The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has named Jho Low and Riza Aziz, the stepson of Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak, in its court filings related to the alleged abuse of 1MDB funds.
Jho Low is said to be close to the prime minister’s family.



Umno lawmaker Nawawi Ahmad has apologised to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong over his remarks regarding 'Malaysian Official 1' (MO1), which caused a stir.
In his statement, Nawawi expressed regret over the matter and promised to be more careful when making statements on social media in the future.
"So with humility and full responsibility, I convey a million apologies to Your Majesty if this issue which became viral had caused hurt to Your Majesty," he said today.
“I do not intend to link Your Majesty to this issue, but it had been made viral by certain parties with a different understanding from what I was trying to say,” Nawawi added.
The Langkawi MP also extended his apologies to the Kedah royal household, and to all Malaysians.
“I hope this issue would be put to rest here,” he said.
MO1 is an individual alleged by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) to have received at least US$731 million out of US$3.5 billion that was supposedly misappropriated from 1MDB.
The department said it is barred by court rules from naming the official in its civil forfeiture proceedings, but this has only fuelled speculation about MO1's true identity.
However, Nawawi supposedly claimed in an Aug 16 Facebook post that MO1 is none other than the Agong, since His Majesty is the country's head of state.
The Facebook post was edited to remove the reference to the Agong four hours later, but not before drawing criticism.
The Majlis Kerabat Diraja Kedah also ticked off Nawawi, saying that he should not have dragged the royal institution into the matter.
Nawawi had previously claimed that he was misunderstood and he was not referring to the DOJ's court filings.



Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio has backed out of hosting a fundraiser for US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton slated for tomorrow, citing scheduling conflicts.
This comes as DiCaprio, 41, has been linked to the 1MDB scandal in the United States Department of Justice's (DOJ) forfeiture lawsuit filed last month.
The DOJ is seeking to forfeit about US$1 billion in assets allegedly purchased with funds stolen from 1MDB.
This includes funds channelled to production house Red Granite Pictures, which is behind the 'Wolf of Wall Street' which portrays DiCaprio.
In the civil action, DiCaprio is referred to only as 'Hollywood Actor 1' and it is suggested that his foundation benefited from gifts from Red Granite, Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak's stepson Riza Aziz and controversial businessman Jho Low.
Riza (photo) and Low were referred to by name in the DOJ civil action, along with two Abu Dhabi officials, Khadem al-Qubaisi and Mohammed Ahmed Badawy Al-Husseiny.
The Hollywood Reporter (THR) in its report quoted a source familiar with the Clinton fundraiser as saying that DiCaprio dropped out of hosting it because the actor-activist's new project would keep him in New York till Wednesday.
DiCaprio's representative, Shawn Sachs, also maintained that it was scheduling conflicts that caused the filmstar to bow out of his hosting duties.
Meanwhile, Hillary and Bill Clinton's charitable foundation has come under intense scrutiny during Hillary's presidential campaign, particularly for its connection to foreign money. The Clinton Foundation has said it would not accept foreign contributions if Hillary becomes president.
THR said that a source with experience in planning presidential campaigns said it would be a 'no brainer' to keep DiCaprio away from Hillary amid the 1MDB scandal, though another said presidential candidates have lower standards for vetting celebrity fundraisers.
Clinton campaign spokesperson Josh Schwerin also said that any suggestion connecting DiCaprio dropping out of the fundraiser with the 1MDB scandal would be completely false.
"If we could have had the event at his home, we would have loved to.
"He was gracious enough to find us a new host.
"We hope to do something with him in the future," Schwerin is reported as saying by THR.
Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel have stepped in to replace DiCaprio to host the fundraising event.



Semambu assemblyperson Lee Chean Chung said he has been called in by the police for questioning, after he had performed a song outside the Sungai Buloh prison in conjunction with former opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim’s birthday.
He said that he was told by the Sungai Buloh district police headquarters to present himself by Aug 24 for supposedly participating in an assembly, and questioned whether there was anything wrong with singing.
“I have been asked to report in by Aug 24. I will contact a lawyer before proceeding further.
“Not only for speaking up, now even singing becomes a problem. What is this country coming to?” he said in a statement today.
The rally took place on Aug 10, where Anwar’s family and supporters gathered outside the prison gates to celebrate Anwar’s birthday.
The day also marked Anwar’s 548th day of incarceration for sodomy.
Anwar is serving a five-year prison sentence. He and his supporters had maintained that the charges are politically motivated.
Lee said he had performed a Chinese-language song titled ‘Glorious Days’ during the celebration.
The song was originally released by the Hong Kong band 'Beyond' in 1991, to commemorate South African leader Nelson Mandela and his anti-apartheid struggle.
Mandela was released from prison about a year before the song made its debut, after 27 years of imprisonment.



Rapper Wee Meng Chee, better known as Namewee, was arrested upon arrival at Kuala Lumpur International Airport today.
This was confirmed by George Town district police chief Faridalathrash Wahid, Bernama reported.
Faridalathrash was quoted as saying that the 33-year-old artiste will be transported to Penang for further investigations.
Namewee was reportedly arrested at 3.30pm. He is expected to be remanded tomorrow.
He is wanted by cops after multiple police reports were lodged on July 30 in George Town over Namewee's music video titled 'Oh My God'.
The police reports complained that the music video had used the word "Allah" in a disrespectful manner and portrayed Muslims as terrorists.
The reports also took issue with the portrayal of Muslim gambling and the use of the azan in the music video.
Police said they will arrest Namewee, who was overseas, as soon as he returned to the country.
Subsequently, Namewee in a video message this month blamed what he described as the "extreme" local media for the perception that he was disrespectful to Islam.
 



DAP's Segambut MP Lim Lip Eng has urged Putrajaya to ban the media from publishing the annual top 20 richest Malaysians list in the interest of their safety.
Lim said this is based on the logic of Federal Territories Minister Tengku Adnan Tengku Mansor, who refused to publicly declare his assets, citing that his family may be kidnapped or robbed.
"If his view is true, then the government should prevent the media from reporting on the top 20 richest Malaysians list, as such publicity would put the safety of their family and assets at risk," Lim said in a statement today.
He added that such a notion puts the police in bad light, as well as the country in the eyes of wealthy tourists.
Lim questioned if the Umno minister was worried about publicly declaring his assets as his wealth may put Malaysian tycoons to shame.
Tengku Adnan had said he was a businessman before joining politics and has a lot of assets.
He said, revealing them could expose his wife and children to being kidnapped or robbed.
However, Lee proposed a compromise, asking that Tengku Adnan only declare his assets, beginning from when he became minister.
"If the minister's claim is that he acquired many assets from his previous business before joining politics is not a lie, then there is no reason for Tengku Adnan not to declare his annual income to the public from when became an Umno minister," said Lim.
The top three richest Malaysians this year according to Forbes were Robert Kuok (US$10 billion net worth), Ananda Krishnan (US$7.4 billion) and Quek Leng Chan (US$5.3 billion).
Stronger check and balance for the non-elected
Tengku Adnan made the justification after PKR communications director Fahmi Fadzil urged him to publicly declare his assets in light of a senior Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) officer being charged for corruption.
Fahmi, in a statement later today, said Tengku Adnan's explanation was unsatisfactory from the point of view of democracy and good governance.
He pointed out that Tengku Adnan only declaring his assets to the prime minister while the KL mayor only declaring his assets to the chief secretary to the government did not suffice.
"This system was clearly inadequate and needs to be revamped as it failed to prevent a 'datuk seri" in DBKL, who was arrested by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) last week, from amassing assets (from his job)," said Fahmi.
He added that the check and balances in DBKL should have a higher threshold because the people of KL do not have a choice as the mayor as well as DBKL board members are not elected.
Fahmi said this high threshold should likewise apply to the federal territories minister.
"The federal territories minister and KL mayor do not need to fear declaring their assets to the public as I believe the police is always ready to ensure their safety as well as the safety of all Malaysians from criminals and robbers.



“I will not change my ethnicity. I was born Chinese and I will die Chinese, I will not become Malay.”
- Malaysian Chinese Muslim Association (Macma) Malacca president Lim Jooi Soon
Of the latest Court of Appeal decision in dismissing the attempts of three bumiputera converts to renounce Islam, DAP’s Zairil Khir Johari, the honourable gentleman from Bukit Bendera, claimed, “Central to this issue is the question of whether the civil or syariah courts should decide in such cases.”
I beg to differ. In my opinion, the central issue is how Islam has been weaponised in this country (and many parts of the world) by the state. This is not a legal issue but a political issue. Nowhere is this clearer in a constitution that privileges one community over the others. Nowhere is this clearer when on the eve of an important election, the head of a ruling coalition makes it clear that he will use his influence - influence that I may add is supposed to be anathema to an independent judiciary - to correct a grave injustice that was the Rooney Rebit case.

Utusan’s column was in reference to a statement made by activist Ab Jalil Backer who claimed that Malaysiakini has become the hub to post comments by those who are not intellectually capable. — AFP picKUALA LUMPUR, Aug 21 — The government should monitor news portal Malaysiakini to prevent the spread of foreign agendas and opposition parties, Mingguan Malaysia said today.

	Writing under their shared Awang Selamat pseudonym, the editors of Utusan Malaysia’s Sunday edition claimed that Malaysiakini has helped promote foreign agendas and even tried to overthrow the ruling government via illegal rallies.

	“There are too much evidence of manipulation and threat from the portal as it brings foreign agenda and of the opposition parties.

	“There have been several times that Malaysiakini has failed to help certain parties including illegal rallies like the Arab Spring to overthrow the democratically elected ruling government,” Awang Selamat wrote.

	The column warned the authorities that the situation in the country could worsen if Malaysiakini was allowed to be and it should be monitored closely for the future wellbeing of the country.

	“If there is a portal that should be monitored on the name of nation building, security and to block seditious elements as well lowly comments, it’s none other than Malaysiakini.

	“Even though the portal gives excuses like it’s not responsible for user comments, that is all a trick. Till when this will be allowed?” Awang questioned.

Utusan’s column was in reference to a statement made by activist Ab Jalil Backer who claimed that Malaysiakini has become the hub to post comments by those who are not intellectually capable.



PKR Youth has challenged Umno Youth vice-chief Khairul Azwan Harun to a debate, following his insistence that there is a purported high-profile plot to topple Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak and the BN.
PKR Youth deputy chief Dr Afif Bahardin said in a statement today the challenge was issued based on Khairul Azwan’s latest reported statement, from his speech at the Teluk Kemang Umno divisional meeting last Saturday.
“PKR Youth is ready to sponsor the location and invite local as well as foreign media to cover the debate. Khairul Azwan just needs to name the place, date and time.
“As PKR Youth deputy chief, I am also ready to be on the same stage with him and debate on this alleged conspiracy,” Afif, who is the Seberang Jaya assemblyperson, added.
He said the debate could tentatively be titled, 'DOJ suit: A conspiracy to topple the prime minister?”
This is in reference to the civil suit filed by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) to recover nearly US$1 billion in assets linked to troubled state investment fund 1MDB.
'Suit part of an international conspiracy' 
Najib and other top Umno leaders have cautioned that the DOJ lawsuit could be part of an international conspiracy to destabilise the BN government.
In his police report lodged last month, Khairul Azwan accused former Bank Negara governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz, former attorney-general Abdul Gani Patail and former Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission chief Abu Kassim Mohamed of conspiring to topple Najib.
Police closed the case after determining that the report was based on hearsay, but a defiant Khairul Azwan has repeatedly insisted that he has successfully foiled the purported plot with his police report.
Last Saturday, Khairul Azwan again defended his police report, claiming that it had also foiled Mahathir’s plan to supposedly hold a press conference for the international media in Jakarta on July 26, with the intention of attacking Najib.
Mahathir yesterday denied this claim by Khairul Azwan and instead hinted that the trio - Zeti, Gani and Abu Kassim - could have been betrayed by one among them. He refused to elaborate on this, or clarify on whether he meant the alleged turncoat was one of the three.


SEPANG, 22 Aug 2016: 
When six packages arrived at the KL International Airport (KLIA) from Uganda this month and were declared as containing grains (cereals), customs officers suspected there might not be a grain of truth in the declaration.
Their suspicions were proven right.
When the team of customs enforcement officers opened the packages which had arrived via Turkish Airlines, they were found to contain 111kg of ivory worth RM946,689 – meant for China and Thailand markets to be processed into ornaments, idols and medicines.
KLIA Customs director Datuk Chik Omar Chik Lim said in that case on Aug 4, a group had flown the ivory from Entebbe, Uganda via Turkish Airlines, transit in Istanbul, Turkey before arriving in KLIA.
“The packages were declared as grains (cereals) to be sent to a Salak Tinggi (Sepang) address. Upon inspection, we found that the address did not exist and could not be reached.
“No arrest was made and our investigations are underway to track down the smuggler of the seized ivory,” he told reporters at KLIA Customs Complex today.
He said this was one of seven cases involving the attempted smuggling of ivory tusks between January and yesterday, totalling almost RM10 million.
During the period, the KLIA Customs also foiled two cases of attempted smuggling of Black Pond Tortoise worth about RM19,400,
Chik Omar said the cases involving ivory and tortoise smuggling were investigated under Section 135 (1)(d) Customs Act 1967 for possession of prohibited goods without import licence.
The KLIA Customs director today handed over 1,174kg of ivory and semi-finished ivory products worth about RM10.19 million which were seized last year and this year, to the Wildlife and National Parks Department for further action.



KUALA LUMPUR, 22 Aug 2016: 
An unemployed man was sentenced to four months’ jail and a stroke of the rotan by the magistrate’s court here today for stealing shoes at the surau of a shopping mall, earlier this month.
Rosli Mohd Yusof, 45, pleaded guilty before magistrate Mohd Faizal Ismail after the charge was read to him and the magistrate ordered the accused to serve his sentence from the date of his arrest on Aug 19.
He was accused of stealing a pair of shoes worth RM380 that belonged to Sadat Abu Bakar, a 36-year-old promoter at a Surau situated at Basement Level 2, Pavillion, Bukit Bintang, here on Aug 8.
Rosli was charged under Section 380 of the Penal Code, which carries a jail term of up to 10 years or a fine and repeated offences subjected to whipping.
Earlier in mitigation, Rosli who was not represented, appealed to the court to give a light sentence as he has a family to take care in his hometown.
Prosecution officer ASP Zuraimi Kamarozzaman urged the court to give a deterrent sentence as this was not the first time the accused was charged for theft.



IPOH, 22 Aug 2016: 
Fifty-two male students of the Gopeng Matriculation College suffered food poisoning after eating a chicken dish at the boy’s college cafeteria last Saturday.
State Health director Datuk Dr Juita Ghazalie said the initial information on the incident was received about 2am yesterday when the students suffered stomach pains, diarrhoea, vomiting, dizziness, nausea, fever and abdominal cramps.
“Checks on all the patients found that they had eaten at the boys’ hostel cafeteria.
“Several samples have been taken such as the utensils and food, to be sent to the Chemistry Department,” she said in a statement today.
Dr Juita said the state Health Department had ordered the cafeteria to be immediately closed under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988.
“The cafeteria operator has been issued a RM1,000-compound under Regulation 35 of the Food Hygiene Regulations.”
Dr Juita added that the department had also briefed the college management, students and cafeteria operator on food hygiene.
It is understood that all the affected students were from the June, 2016  intake.
Last Wednesday, 56 students from the Malay College Kuala Kangsar suffered food poisoning after having their meal at the college’s dining hall.
Dr Juita said the investigation found that the van used to transport the food was dirty and maggot-infested while the containers including the jugs and dispensers were not cleaned properly.



KUALA LUMPUR, 22 Aug 2016: 
Effective next Thursday, Sept 1, Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) will clamp the tyres of those vehicles parked illegally and causing traffic congestion in the federal capital.
Kuala Lumpur mayor Datuk Seri Mhd Amin Nordin Abd Aziz said such drastic action would be implemented at all areas in the city – especially at major roads identified as public or tourist spots.
The areas include Jalan Masjid India, Jalan Tun Sambanthan (Brickfields), Jalan Raja Muda Abdul Aziz, Jalan Bulan, Jalan Changkat Bukit Bintang, Jalan Chow Kit, Jalan Kenanga, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Solaris Mont Kiara and Jalan Klang Lama.
“This implementation is based on a study and observation by DBKL’s Pemudah (Special Task Force to Facilitate Business) which revealed that irresponsible behaviour by some motorists is one of the factors for traffic congestion.
“A total of 746,185 summonses were issued from January to July this year for traffic obstruction, 232,726 summonses for not paying parking charges and 4,857 vehicles were towed for parking offences.
“Thus, sterner action is needed.”
Mhd Amin said owners of clamped vehicles must be present to pay a RM50 fine within four hours after the clamping.
Failure to do so would result in their vehicles being towed and imposed with RM100 fine, he said.
The enforcement is in accordance with the Road Transport Act 1987 and Road Transport (Provision of Parking Places) Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur Order 2016.
Meanwhile, several major roads in the city will be closed in stages from Saturday to next Wednesday (Aug 31) – in conjunction with the National Day rehearsal and celebration at Dataran Merdeka here.
Kuala Lumpur Traffic Investigations and Enforcement deputy chief Supt Ahmad Adnan Basri said the road closure would be effective 6am to 1pm.
“Members of the public are urged to use alternative routes or public transportation should they plan to go to the city centre.”
Ahmad Adnan said only vehicles with special stickers would be allowed to enter Dataran Merdeka via the Dato’ Onn Roundabout towards Jalan Gereja and to park at the square’s basement parking area.
About 150 traffic policemen will be on duty on Aug 31, he added.
The affected roads are Jalan Travers/Jalan Damansara (National Museum), Jalan Mahameru/Jalan Damansara (Carcosa), Jalan Mahameru/Jalan Damansara (from old palace direction), Jalan Lembah/Jalan Perdana (National Mosque), Hishamuddin Roundabout/Jalan Lembah, Jalan Tembusu/Jalan Lembah, Jalan Kinabalu/Hishamuddin Roundabout, Jalan Cenderasari/Jalan Perdana, Jalan Leboh Pasar Besar/Jalan Hishamuddin.
Other roads include Jalan Leboh Pasar Besar/Jalan Mahkamah Persekutuan, Jalan Leboh Ampang/Jalan Tun Perak, Jalan Dang Wangi/Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, Dato’ Onn Roundabout/Jalan Parlimen, Jalan Kinabalu/Bukit Aman exit, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman/Jalan Raja, Jalan Raja/Jalan Hishamuddin, Jalan Parlimen/Jalan Raja Laut, Jalan Sultan Ismail/Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Munshi Abdullah/Jalan Dang Wangi.



MERSING, 22 Aug 2016: 
Pos Malaysia Bhd received two new Malaysian Book of Records recognitions for its efforts in installing the first underwater Royal post box and the first man-made corals garden in the country.
Both, the Royal post box and Tunku Laksamana Corals Garden were installed in Pulau Mensirip, about 45-minute boat ride from the Mersing jetty, here.
MBOR operations director Christopher Wong Hong Wai presented the certificates to the Sultan of Johor, Sultan Ibrahim Almarhum Sultan Iskandar who later, handed it to Pos Malaysia group chief executive officer Datuk Mohd Shukrie Mohd Salleh, during the final day of Kembara Jelajah Pulau Mersing 2016 today.
Sultan Ibrahim had also signed a plaque for the Dugong Sanctuary Monument and pinned its location on the Google Map, besides launching Pos Malaysia services and receiving explanation on the upgrading work of the hybrid solar project in the island.
Earlier, Sultan Ibrahim had also dived nine metres deep in Pulau Mensirip to place the Sultan of Johor logo on top of the post box and inserted a special waterproof postcard as a gimmick for its launching.
Mohd Shukrie said the installation of the new underwater post box was done through cooperation between Pos Malaysia, Communications and Multimedia Commission and Johor state government in promoting postal tourism in the country.
This, he said was a continuity to the success of Pos Malaysia before this in installing the post box on Mount Kinabalu, followed by the one in Pulau Layang-Layang, both of which are in Sabah and another one in Tanjung Piai, Johor.
At another island, Pulau Pemanggil, Sultan Ibrahim had placed a recreational artificial reef as a mark for a Special Area Plan (Fishing Zone), a collaboration between Pulau Pemanggil, the Johor National Park Corporation and Mersing District Council.
Meanwhile in Pulau Aur, he launched the security post and water source of the Sultan Iskandar Marine Park, followed by the artificial reefs placement in the marine park.
The Kembara Jelajah Pulau Mersing 2016, led by the Sultan involved eight islands in Mersing waters, namely Pulau Tengah, Pulau Besar, Pulau Rawa, Pulau Mensirip, Pulau Pemanggil, Pulau Aur, Pulau Tinggi and Pulau Sibu covering more than 500km.




PADANG BESAR, 22 Aug 2016: 
Like a scene straight out of the Hollywood movie Snakes on a plane, the Perlis Royal Malaysian Customs Department found itself in a similar predicament today.
Except that the 181 serpents were found on board the Bangkok-Padang Besar express train this morning.
Other animals included two iguanas, 28 Dhab lizards, 10 tortoises, 10 squirrel gliders and 11 rabbits. The 248 exotic animals totalled about RM70,000.
Initial investigations revealed that a syndicate attempted to smuggle the animals of various species in four bags when a team of customs enforcement officers unmasked the ‘ticketless commuters’.
Department director Kamarudin Jaafar said the animals were meant for sale as pets as there was a high demand for them.
He said about 9am, customs officers checked the passenger and cargo coaches, only to stumble on four suspicious-looking bags.
“Two bags were found in the cargo coach and the rest in the toilet. When the bags were put through the scanning machine, movements believed to be made by live animals were detected.”
Kamarudin said the 248 animals – confiscated under the Customs Act 1967 – were handed over to the Perlis Department of Wildlife and National Parks (Perhilitan) for further action.
He added that the owner of the bags could not be detected.
Meanwhile, Perlis Perhilitan director, Mohamad Affendi Ibrahim said all the animals were foreign species worth hundreds of ringgit each.
He said the case would be investigated under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010 (Act 716).



KUALA LUMPUR, 22 Aug 2016: 
A high stakes international sale of Malaysian passports was foiled on Friday afternoon by Malaysian police, thanks to a tip-off from a reader of The Rakyat Post.
While details are still sketchy as to exactly what took place in the prompt action by police here, it is learnt that the planned sale had to be called off and the hunt is afoot for the culprits abroad.
The drama began around noon when a syndicate member posted a short clip on Youtube to authenticate the availability of Malaysian passports for interested buyers.
It was learnt that the behind-the-scenes negotiations had been taking place earlier for several hours via a disguised online identity and after initial interest was expressed, the seller offered to show on Youtube the Malaysian passport offered was authentic.
The Youtube video posting was spotted by chance and the Malaysian police were immediately alerted to the link.
Swinging into action, the police contacted Youtube via its owner Google Inc and a trace was swiftly made to identify the suspects’ identities and locations.
Malaysian police have declined to provide any details as to the outcome of this trace, but the Youtube video account was suspended shortly after the multinational probe began.
It was learnt that the syndicate – who move fast to avoid being caught – managed to elude authorities in the country they were at, but a manhunt is in progress.




KOTA BELUD, 21 Aug 2016: 
Two teachers drowned after a boat with 10 people on board capsized while on its way to Pulau Mantanani, near here from Kampung Rampayan Laut, this evening.
A spokesperson for the Kota Belud Fire and Rescue Station said the dead were identified as Limun Gamburud, headmaster of Sekolah Kebangsaan (SK) Mantanani and Kamariah Hamdan, a teacher in the same school.
“Both victims were pronounced dead by medical officers and eight more victims who are being treated at the Kota Belud Hospital. They are reported to be in stable condition.”
He said the Kota Belud Fire and Rescue Station received information about the incident at 3.45pm and a team of eight firemen in a fire engine arrived at the scene about 25 minutes later.
The rescue operation ended at 7.25pm.
Mohd Mustazar Bundah, a teacher at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Arshad and also Kamariah’s relative said he was shocked and saddened by the incident.
He said Kamariah who had just been transferred from SK Nahaba was very concerned about the wellbeing of her students.
“The last time I met her, I had asked about her teaching experience there (SK Mantanani). According to her (Kamariah), every place and school had its own challenges,” he said adding that she leaves behind four children.
Communications and Multimedia Minister Datuk Seri Dr Salleh Said Keruak conveyed his condolences to the families affected by the boat tragedy this evening.
“My family and I are saddened by the incident which occurred in the Kota Belud district.”




SHAH ALAM, 21 Aug 2016: 
A charred body was found in a Mercedes-Benz car bearing the logo of Royal Malaysian Air Force Recreational Club which caught fire at the Anggerik Mokara roundabout in Section 13 here early today.
Shah Alam District Police chief ACP Shafien Mamat said the body, whose identity was unknown, was found in the driver’s seat of the car bearing registration number AJP9, at 5am.
“When the police and the fire squad arrived at the scene, the car was totally burnt.
“The victim was believed to have driven the car from Kota Kemuning before it skidded and crashed into a tree in the middle of the roundabout,” Shafien said in a statement.
Following the collision, he said the tree fell on the car, causing the driver to be trapped inside, while the car caught fire.
The body was taken to Shah Alam Hospital for post mortem. The case is being investigated under Section 41(1) of the Road Transport Act 1987.



KOTA BARU, 21 Aug 2016: 
Three more Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) offcers are being remanded for seven days from today to facilitate investigations into a corruption case.
The remand orders on an engineer and two technicians were issued by magistrate Ahmad Adha Amir Yasser Amri here today.
An officer from the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) said the three TNB officers, aged between 30 and 50, were being investigated under Section 23 of the MACC Act 2009 for allegedly using their posts or positions to obtain bribes.
The three suspects had arrived at the magistrate’s court about 12.45pm under tight security. They were detained at the MACC office here yesterday when they came to give their statements.
Their arrest followed the remand of a TNB senior officer for seven days from last Tuesday, Aug 16 to assist in investigations into alleged corruption, abuse of power and money laundering.




Cause of 56 Malay College Kuala Kangsar students falling ill last week traced to dirty and maggot-infested van used to transport the food.

IPOH: Fifty-two male students of the Gopeng Matriculation College suffered food poisoning after eating a chicken dish at the boy’s college cafeteria last Saturday.
State Health Director Dr Juita Ghazalie said the initial information on the incident was received about 2am on Sunday when the students suffered stomach pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, dizziness, nausea, fever and abdominal cramps.
“Checks on all the patients found that they had eaten at the boys’ hostel cafeteria.
“Several samples have been taken such as the utensils and food, to be sent to the Chemistry Department,” she said in a statement, here, today.
Dr Juita said the state Health Department had ordered the cafeteria to be immediately closed under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988.
“The cafeteria operator has been issued a RM1,000 compound fine under Regulation 35 of the Food Hygiene Regulations,” she said.
Dr Juita added that the department had also briefed the college management, students and cafeteria operator on food hygiene.
It is understood that all the affected students were from the June 2016 intake.
Last Wednesday, 56 students from the Malay College Kuala Kangsar suffered food poisoning after having their meal at the college dining hall.
Dr Juita said the investigation found that the van used to transport the food was dirty and maggot-infested while the containers, including the jugs and dispensers, were not cleaned properly.

Income for PPR applicants may be raised to RM3,000



The proposal to expand eligibility will be brought to the Cabinet for a discussion.

PARIT: The household income limit of applicants for dwellings under the People’s Housing Programme (PPR) will be increased from RM2,500 to RM3,000.
Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government Minister Noh Omar said the new rate was proposed to be similar to that for the 1Malaysia People’s Aid (BR1M).
He said the proposal would be tabled at the Cabinet meeting next week to be discussed in detail.
“When the conditions are similar for BR1M recipients, it is easier for us to check on the eligibility of the applicants for PPR housing,” he told reporters after a ground-breaking ceremony at the Seri Iskandar PPR with Perak Menteri Besar Zambry Abd Kadir, here, today.

Students Miksudiar Aluj and Norieen Yaacob are still traumatised by the incident in which four of their schoolmates died and one is still missing.

GUA MUSANG: Tomorrow marks one year since seven pupils of Sekolah Kebangsaan (SK) Tohoi went missing in an incident which shocked the nation.
The two survivors, Miksudiar Aluj, 12, and Norieen Yaacob, 11, have yet to return to school as they are still traumatised by the incident in which four of their schoolmates died and one is still missing.
Last year, after almost 50 days in the jungle, four of the children – Ika Ayel, 9, Haikal Yaacob, 8, Linda Rosli, 8, and Juvina David, 7 — were found dead, while Sasa Sobrie, 8, remains missing.
Today, in Kampung Gawin in Pos Tohoi here, Miksudiar still prefers to stay home.
Norieen, who is from Kampung Penad in Pos Tohoi and has been living with her aunt in Kuala Lumpur since last May, constantly cries when she thinks about the incident.
Miksudiar’s uncle Akek Bahel, 47, when met at his home in Kampung Gawin today, said she was recovering but still needed treatment for her heart problems.
Akek said Miksudiar wanted to return to school, but her mother Rosita Bahel, 43, was reluctant to let her go as she was afraid a similar incident would happen again.
“We always tell Rosita to let her daughter return to school,” Akek told reporters.
Meanwhile, Norieen’s mother, Midah Angah, 41, when met at her home in Kampung Penad, said Norieen could not stay at home as she was always crying when she thought of her younger brother, Haikal, who died in the incident.
Midah said Norieen had to be taken from the village to live with her aunt in Kuala Lumpur to help her forget the tragedy.
“We planned to let Norieen return to school, but are waiting for her to come back in October to discuss the matter and choose which primary school she wants to go to.”
Gua Musang District Education Officer Muhammad Zahari Othman said they would give preference to the two pupils to study at the schools of their choice.

Youth and Sports Minister Khairy Jamaluddin aims to have an environmental-friendly Games in Kuala Lumpur from Aug 19 to Aug 31, 2017.

KUALA LUMPUR: The 2017 Southeast Asian Games, officially known as the 29th SEA Games, will also be the “green games”, Youth and Sports Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said today.
In an effort to preserve the environment, Khairy stated that he had already instructed the SEA Games secretariat to ensure an environmentally-friendly Games.
Khairy provided several examples, such as having recycling bins all around Kuala Lumpur during the games – as opposed to only having rubbish bins – and less usage of plastic bags for food and merchandise vendors during the Games.
“The SEA Games are going to attract the attention of the entire world. We want them to see that these are initiatives that they can take in their daily lives,” said Khairy.
He was speaking to reporters after closing the Pan-Pacific and Southeast Asia Women’s Association of Malayisa (PPSEAWA) Conference, in which he also urged Malaysians to “tell people off” when they see somebody committing an “environmental crime”.
“It is not enough for us to tell ourselves; we must also tell other people.
“If you see somebody littering or throwing a cigarette on the floor, tell them off even if they are older than you.
“Be nice about it, say ‘mak cik, you shouldn’t be doing that’ or something along those lines.
“Malaysians are notorious for being negative when it comes to issues regarding the environment,” said Khairy.
The 29th SEA Games will be held in Kuala Lumpur from Aug 19 to Aug 31, 2017.
The Malaysian Hockey Confederation (MHC) said earlier today that they are determined to make a clean sweep of all four gold medals to be contested in the 2017 Kuala Lumpur SEA Games.
Its president, Subahan Kamal, pledged to sweep two gold medals in indoor hockey, which will be contested for the first time, and two gold medals in field hockey.
Malaysia has won the gold medal in men’s field hockey 15 times while the women’s team won it on six occasions.

Fahmi Fadzil also urges Tengku Adnan to provide data on open tender projects not completed on time.

PETALING JAYA: PKR Communications Director Fahmi Fadzil today called on Federal Territories Minister Tengku Adnan Tengku Mansor to reveal all projects handled by a senior Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) officer who was accused of corruption.
Fahmi said this in response to Tengku Adnan’s statement that open tender projects could cause problems when bidders who offer low prices are unable to complete the projects in time.
Fahmi refuted this, urging Tengku Adnan – more widely known as Ku Nan – to reveal projects handled by “DBKL Official 1”.
“I invite Tengku Adnan to announce the total number of projects granted through open tenders and direct negotiations involving this ‘DBKL Official 1’,” Fahmi said in a statement today.
He also noted that the government’s way of acquisition is through open tenders and competitive bidding.
Fahmi asked if Tengku Adnan was disagreeing with Prime Minister Najib Razak, who previously said he was committed to open tenders in order to weed out corruption.
“Does this mean that Ku Nan does not agree with the PM and Umno president’s open tender preference?
“If Ku Nan believes that open tenders pose a problem, does he have sufficient data and evidence to change an important government policy?
“This is because policy-based data and evidence are one of the foundations of the government that we established,” said Fahmi.
He also urged Ku Nan to reveal the percentage of projects that are not completed on time.
Last Monday, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission detained a Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) executive director, with a “Datuk Seri” title, along with two other top government officers from Kelantan and Malacca for allegedly accepting bribes, misusing power and involvement in money laundering.
On another matter, Fahmi said the system that currently existed where ministers declared their assets to higher authorities in their respective ministries was not good enough.
“Tengku Adnan said that he declares his assets to the Prime Minister (Najib Razak) every year, while the Kuala Lumpur Mayor declares his assets to the Chief Secretary of the Federal Government.
“This system is obviously not enough and must be overhauled since it has failed to identify and prevent the accumulation of property allegedly owned by a ‘Datuk Seri’ from DBKL (also known as ‘DBKL Official 1’), who the MACC arrested last week,” he said.

49 Macau scam cases solved with arrests of 97



The scam involves making fake phone calls to victims by syndicate members posing as police officers or Bank Negara staff.

KUALA LUMPUR: Police have solved 49 “Macau scam” cases, involving estimated losses amounting to RM2.1 million, following the arrest of 97 individuals in Juru and Perai, Penang, on Aug 17.
The suspects, including 88 foreigners, were arrested in three factories and a house.
Bukit Aman Commercial Crimes CID Deputy Director of Intelligence and Operations SAC Roslan Abd Wahid said the cases were recorded from last year until the middle of this year.
Investigations revealed that the syndicate had been active since last year, with the majority of their scams conducted via telephone using the Voice Over Internet Protocol method.
“They make fake phone calls to their victims by disguising as police officers or staff of Bank Negara.
“They will claim that family members of the victims are having legal or financial issues,” he told reporters after a programme with the media here today.
Roslan said police have opened 49 investigation papers under Section 420 of the Penal Code for fraud.

"We are those who were raised and instilled with values that are needed to execute and realise the hopes of Mahathir."

PETALING JAYA: With or without its pro-tem chairman, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) will be able to stand the test of time and persist in providing strong competition to Barisan Nasional (BN).
Its pro-tem secretary, Kamarulazman Habibur Rahman, said this was because those in the party’s founding committee have embraced Mahathir’s ideologies and struggles.
“We are those who were raised and instilled with values that are needed to execute and realise the hopes of Mahathir.
“He already told us what is needed. We understand his wishes and although we hope he will be blessed with a long life, we have told him that when he’s gone, his legacy will remain and will be executed by the next generation.”
Kamarulazman also said the founding members were chosen to start the ball rolling, but that there would be more influential names to lead the party once it is officially formed.
Bersatu was kick-started by Mahathir to provide a platform for, among others, Umno members and supporters who are unhappy with the way the party is managed under the leadership of its president, Najib Razak, but are not ready to fully switch to the Opposition.
Besides Mahathir and Kamarulazman, the other founding members of Bersatu are former Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, former Kedah Menteri Besar Mukhriz Mahathir, former Umno member Anina Saadudin, former Bendang Baru Umno Youth Chief Akhramsyah Sanusi and youth activist Syed Saddiq Abdul Rahman.
Syed Saddiq when speaking to FMT, said Bersatu is a movement of the people and hence, will exist so long as it remains true to its ideologies.
“Undeniably, Mahathir plays an important role in the establishment and the continuity of the movement. But just like how all movements operate, the ideology behind them will be the driving force for its continuity.
“This means that as long as there are leaders who are corrupt, who abuse power and who don’t acknowledge the rule of law, the existence of a reform-based Malay party will always be needed.”
He added that besides Mahathir, the party has plenty of other credible and prominent leaders who had abandoned their positions of power and comfort in order to fight for all Malaysians.
“I personally believe that a lot of Malaysians will join this party not because of the personalities.
“Many Malaysians are just very angered by the fact that the Malay card has been misused time after time to deflect accountability and corrupt practices.
“So even without us, the party will continue.”

The governments of India, Malaya, Britain and Japan have all forsaken them, says group representing survivors of the railway.

KUALA LUMPUR: New research indicates that more than 100,000 Tamils, forcibly recruited by the Japanese in Malaya, died building the Siam-Burma death railway.
Their records were never collated nor did their sacrifices find a place in Malaysian history, said P Chandrasekaran, chairman of the Death Railway Interest Group (DRIG) in a statement.
“The actual number of Asians who died on the railway project will never be known.”
He conceded that public awareness was sorely lacking.
“The governments of India, Malaya, Britain and Japan have all forsaken them.”
Chandrasekaran was setting the theme for DRIG’s one-day symposium on Sept 16, Malaysia Day, to enlighten the public on a piece of Malaysia’s forgotten history.
DRIG wants to document the remaining Malaysian survivors of the Death Railway, he disclosed.
“We want the voiceless to have a voice.
“We will promote their cause and create public awareness.”
The fate of the Asians who worked on the Death Railway were in contrast with the Westerners, who were also forced to help build the railway, according to DRIG.
The infamous Siam-Burma Railway also used prisoners of war (PoWs). The records show that 63,000 Western PoWs worked on the Death Railway. It took the lives of about 13,000 Allied PoWs.
After the war, their remains were salvaged from the 415km-long railway and meticulously laid to rest at three cemeteries dedicated to them, two in the Kanchanaburi district in Thailand, and one in Thanbyuzayat in Myanmar.
The survivors were repatriated, cared for and received some compensation for their ordeal, recalled Chandrasekaran.
“The same cannot be said of the Asian victims.”
The world has almost totally forgotten them. Hundreds of thousands of Asians from Burma, Thailand, Indochina, Malaya and Indonesia worked on the railway project.
“They far outnumbered the PoWs,” said Chandrasekaran. “Their sufferings were no less, if not worse.”
At least 270,000 Asians are thought to have been inducted to help complete the railway in record time of just over a year, working long hours in the inhospitable, disease-infested jungles of Burma and Siam.
The Thai–Burma railway was built in 1942–43 to supply the Japanese forces in Burma and to attack the British in India. This followed attacks at sea on Japanese ships.

Owners of clamped vehicles must pay RM50 fine within four hours or the vehicle will be towed away and imposed a RM100 fine.

KUALA LUMPUR: Effective Sept 1, Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) will clamp the wheels of those vehicles parked illegally and causing traffic congestion in the federal capital.
Kuala Lumpur Mayor Mhd Amin Nordin Abd Aziz said such drastic action would be implemented at all areas in the city, especially along major roads which were identified as public or tourist spots.
The areas include Jalan Masjid India, Jalan Tun Sambanthan (Brickfields), Jalan Raja Muda Abdul Aziz, Jalan Bulan, Jalan Changkat Bukit Bintang, Jalan Chow Kit, Jalan Kenanga, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Solaris Mont Kiara and Jalan Klang Lama.
Mhd Amin said owners of clamped vehicles must be present to pay a RM50 fine within four hours after the clamping.
Failure to do so would result in their vehicles being towed and imposed a RM100 fine, he said.
The enforcement is in accordance with the Road Transport Act 1987 and Road Transport (Provision of Parking Places) Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur Order 2016.
“This implementation is based on a study and observation by DBKL’s Pemudah (Special Task Force to Facilitate Business) which revealed that irresponsible behaviour by some motorists is one of the factors for traffic congestion.
“A total of 746,185 summonses were issued from January to July this year for traffic obstruction, 232,726 summonses for not paying parking charges and 4,857 vehicles were towed away for parking offences.
“Thus, sterner action is needed,” he told reporters after launching the Kuala Lumpur Low Carbon Society Blueprint 2030 Workshop here today.

He hopes unemployed youths will seize the opportunity to work in cafes and other places regardless of the salary offered.

PETALING JAYA: Former Premier Dr Mahathir Mohamad has been accused by his critics of amassing billions of ringgit while leading the country for over two decades.
However, his son, Mukhriz, told a different story, saying he had to work part-time while studying in Japan just to support his daily expenses.
“I was sent to Japan to further my studies. There, I worked part-time in a bank with a salary of only RM350 a month.
“I worked five days a week and used the salary to support my needs,” said the former Kedah menteri besar to Malay daily Sinar Harian.
Mukhriz’s brother, Mokhzani, is one of the richest individuals in Malaysia.
Speaking further to the daily, the pro-tem treasurer of Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) said he had intentionally applied for a job as a waiter with a cafe to attract youths into working part-time.
This, he hoped, would subsequently reduce the unemployment rate.
He added that youths do not have to waste their time at home after completing their studies but should instead seek employment, regardless of the salary.
“If there is an employment opportunity, seize it.”
Last month, Mukhriz had come under the spotlight for responding to a waiter’s vacancy at a cafe in Kedah.
He did this on the cafe’s Instagram advertisement and said he was ready to work full time as he was currently unemployed.
“Man – yes, definitely a man. Can work full time – don’t even have a job. Aged 18 and above – I’m already 52. Punctual – with God’s will. Interesting character – (I’m) Quite interesting,” he wrote.

Opposition MPs want action to be taken against Langkawi rep for lodging false report and urge him to personally seek the King's forgiveness for linking the latter to the DoJ suit on 1MDB.

PETALING JAYA: If Nawawi Ahmad thought his open apology to the King in a Facebook post on Malaysian Official 1 (MO1) would get him off the hook, he has to think again.
DAP lawmaker Lim Lip Eng, for one, pointed out that Nawawi’s apology was proof that he had lodged a false police report in which he denied stating the Yang di-Pertuan Agong was MO1.
The DoJ in its report last month, claimed that the unnamed MO1 had allegedly received US$731 million misappropriated from 1MDB.
According to the details provided by the DoJ, MO1 is a “high-ranking official in the Malaysian Government who also held a position of authority with 1MDB”, and that the individual was a relative of Prime Minister Najib Razak’s stepson, Riza Aziz.
Lim said Inspector-General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar must now explain if action can be taken against Nawawi.
“Shouldn’t Nawawi be arrested?” the Segambut MP asked FMT.
Fellow DAP colleague Teresa Kok said Nawawi should apologise to the King in person and seek a royal pardon.
PKR Vice-President Tian Chua said the Langkawi lawmaker must be accountable for his “reckless statement”.
“As Nawawi is from Umno, its president Najib Razak should have reprimanded him for his reckless statement that insulted the King.”
Former Wanita Umno member Anina Saadudin, however, was a little more forgiving, stating that everyone makes mistakes.
“It is important to learn from it. Do not repeat the same mistakes again. If you do so, you are a complete moron.”
She said if Nawawi continued repeating such mistakes, he would risk losing his parliamentary seat as the rakyat would reject a “no class MP”.
However, she said the apology should be extended to all Kedahans, as the current Agong is from Kedah.
Nawawi recently courted controversy by arguing that based on the Federal Constitution, the Agong is the MO1”.
Many notable figures, including former Umno Deputy President Muhyiddin Yassin and former Kedah Menteri Besar Mukhriz Mahathir, have demanded that Nawawi apologise for issuing the “treasonous” statement.
A total of eight police reports have been lodged against him to date, including one filed by Anina.
Nawawi subsequently claimed he was misunderstood and today issued a statement apologising to the King. He posted the apology on Facebook.

Yellow fever alert: M’sia quarantines visitors



A total of 37 people who visited Brazil without vaccination certificates undergo screening for the disease.

PETALING JAYA: Malaysia is vigilant against the entry of yellow fever.
A total of 37 passengers who arrived from Brazil have been screened for the disease between Aug 12 and Aug 21, with most of them arriving at KLIA and one in Penang.
Four of them were quarantined before being allowed entry into the country.
Health Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah said the four did not have yellow fever vaccination but they were in healthy condition.
“The virus can be brought into Malaysia through visitors originating from countries which carry a risk of yellow fever transmission and have not been vaccinated for the disease,” he told NST Online.
The news report said three sports officials in the Malaysian Rio Olympic contingent, from Penang, were quarantined due to a yellow fever scare.
Those without a yellow fever vaccination certificate can be quarantined for up to six days upon arrival in Malaysia.
Yellow fever can be transmitted through the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito although the tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) can also serve as a vector for the virus.

Police have called in PKR Youth Information Chief Lee Chean Chung to record a statement after he sang at Anwar Ibrahim's recent 69th birthday bash outside Sungai Buloh Prison. VIDEO INSIDE

PETALING JAYA: Something is wrong with the country when singing a Cantonese song written in tribute to Nelson Mandela can be considered a crime, according to PKR Youth Information Chief Lee Chean Chung.
Speaking to FMT, Lee said the government has suppressed the voices of the people by charging them in court for sedition but he never thought that he would face similar charges for simply singing a song.
“What more a Cantonese song that talks about freedom and is a tribute to Nelson Mandela.
“What’s wrong with Nelson Mandela? Is the Malaysian Government offended by something that happened in a different continent?”
Lee, who is also the Semambu assemblyman, had issued a statement on his Facebook page revealing that he had been called in by the Sungai Buloh police to record his statement regarding his attendance at Anwar Ibrahim’s 69th birthday bash in front of the Sungai Buloh Prison on Aug 10.
During the birthday party, Lee had performed a song in front of those in attendance.
The song in question was entitled “Glorious Days” by famous Hong Kong rock band Beyond.
Lee has been asked to report to the police station before Aug 24.
“I’m still discussing with my lawyers on what my next course of action should be.”
South China Morning Post, in a Dec 7, 2013 article, said the 1991 track Glorious Days had become a Cantonese anthem for idealistic youth and is from beginning to end a homage to Mandela.
“Never stop struggling with uncertainty. I believe the future can be altered. But who can achieve it?” the lyrics read in part, it said.
Today, it is widely used as one of the theme songs in local demonstrations because of its message of anti-racism and aspiration to freedom, the report stated.

Malaysia not spending enough to provide exclusive trainers in badminton for specialised areas like diet, psychology, physical fitness, says ex-national coach.
PETALING JAYA: Lee Chong Wei is not the one to blame for failing to deliver Malaysia a gold medal at the Rio Olympics, according to a former national legend.
Misbun Sidek, who was a former national badminton coach, lays the blame on the country’s lack of a developed and complete training system, China Press reported.
“That is the reason why Malaysia is still unable to produce athletes that can deliver a gold medal.
“Eight years ago, I voiced out the problems of the country’s outdated training system, but I was ignored,” Misbun was quoted as saying by China Press.
Another major issue holding back the nation’s top athletes in the sport was funding, which was in abundance in China when it came to coaching their top badminton players, he said.
“I was invited by China’s badminton head coach, Li Yongbo to visit their training centre and I was impressed by the size and sophistication of the centre.”
Misbun, who used to coach Chong Wei for a decade, added that Lin Dan has a seven-member team who trained him in all aspects, including focus, psychological, physical fitness and diet.
“However, Malaysia was left behind in these aspects as the financial allocation for such trainers is not that high. So a group of people who specialise in such areas would have to take care of athletes in other sports aside from badminton.
“That is why China already has a successor for Lin Dan, that is Chen Long, while Malaysia still has no candidate to take over from Chong Wei,” Misbun said.
“When Chong Wei battled against Chen Long, he had (the day before) spent most of his physical strength (facing Lin Dan).”
Misbun also claimed that there was no one giving our World Number 1 pointers on how to learn from his past mistakes, or ways to secure the top spot.
Chong Wei won the silver medal, his third in the Olympics, after he was defeated by Chen Long 21-18, 21-18 last Saturday. He had defeated perennial rival Lin Dan in the semifinal earlier. Chong Wei took three sets to defeat Lin Dan, with the rubber set going to the wire and ending in a 22-20 win for the Malaysian.
Malaysia ended its 2016 Rio Olympics mission with four silver medals and a bronze. Three of the silvers were from badminton.

Home Minister says former militant leader still poses a national security threat as his release could revive the feared Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist movement.

PETALING JAYA: Former Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) militant leader Hambali is still a national security threat and should not be released from Guantanamo Bay by the Prison’s Periodic Review Board.
In a report in the News Straits Times, Deputy Home Minister Nur Jazlan Mohamed was quoted as saying that it was highly likely that Hambali, whose real name is Riduan Isamuddin, still wielded strong influence over the remaining members of JI in the country and his release could spur a revival of the feared movement.
“The militant JI group may still have followers and they may be waiting for Hambali’s release to revive the movement, although it was mopped out some 10 years ago.
“This is a matter of national security and great priority should be given to this. These factors should outweigh the release of a jailed man who is capable of training anyone into a radical soldier,” said Nur Jazlan after a working visit to the Home Ministry Complex in Taman Setia Tropika, today.
Nur Jazlan said that although Hambali was an Indonesian, the militant had stayed in Malaysia for many years and had been successful in recruiting new members into the JI.
Hambali is currently among 61 other “high value” detainees and terrorists in the US facility of Guantanamo in Cuba, where he has spent the last 13 years.
Fears of his release surfaced when US President Barack Obama pledged to shut Guantanamo Bay when he was sworn into office.
Obama’s office also set up the Periodic Review Board to hear the cases of selected detainees who could face possible release.
Hambali was responsible for the 2002 Bali bombing that killed 202 people as well as the bombing of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
He was initially held in a secret US overseas prison for three years before ending up in Guantanamo Bay on Sept 4, 2006.

Lawyers for Liberty head Eric Paulsen wants authorities to work with organisers to facilitate peaceful assembly rather than work against it.
PETALING JAYA: Lawyers for Liberty (LFL) have criticised the harassment, arrest and detention of the organisers of the Tangkap Malaysian Official 1 (TMO1) rally.
In a statement, LFL Executive Director Eric Paulsen said it was appalled with the biased stance of the police and the Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) in relation to the rally.
He said it was not the authorities’ duty to protect the political interest of the Prime Minister or Umno but instead it is their duty to uphold the rights of citizens as enshrined under the Federal Constitution.
“Every Malaysian possesses the constitutional right to peaceful assembly in a public space.”
Paulsen said that the authorities’ argument that the organisers have failed to adhere to the Peaceful Assembly Act 2012 (PAA) was false, as they would have never agreed to the protest at Dataran Merdeka.
He said the public should have access to Dataran Merdeka, as it was a piece of public property with great historical significance, and DBKL should not be deciding on who had access to it or not.
Paulsen said it was also appalling that the three student activists were arrested on Saturday and remanded three days for offences under the PAA and Section 447 of the Penal Code for criminal trespass when they entered UiTM Seri Iskandar in Ipoh, Perak, to promote the rally.
“A measure of the blame unfortunately must also go to the magistrate for rubber-stamping the police’s application for remand when clearly there was no merit in arresting and investigating these youths for these alleged offences.”
He said over the years, the PAA, had been abused, with the opposition and rights activists targeted, while pro-government or pro-Umno assemblies were “let off scot-free”.
“It is astonishing that the authorities still cite this piece of legislation as a method of facilitating assemblies, when in reality it is applied in an arbitrary manner to suppress opposition assemblies,” he said, adding there have been numerous instances where organisers tried to adhere to the PAA, but the authorities have made it virtually impossible to comply.
Paulsen said the authorities should work with the organisers to facilitate peaceful assembly rather than working against it.
Last week, TMO1 spokesperson Anis Syafiqah Md Yusof said the rally will proceed at Dataran Merdeka, despite Inspector-General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar advising the organisers to find another venue.

Minister of Youth and Sports talks about the tough job Alam Flora workers have and how the rakyat can help by separating their trash and preserving the environment. VIDEO INSIDE
PETALING JAYA: It’s not every day you see a minister in full Alam Flora garb, riding a dumpster and picking up trash as he promotes the importance of separating one’s trash for the sake of the environment.
But that’s precisely what Khairy Jamaluddin, the Minister of Youth and Sports did in his effort to educate the public about the important and tough job of Alam Flora workers who work tirelessly to help keep our streets clean and preserve our environment.
In a 5:30-minute video, posted by Crap.TV on their official Facebook page, Khairy is seen alongside three other Alam Flora workers with brooms and dust-pans in hand as they go about a typical work day.
Although sometimes humorous and light-hearted in how he puts across the message of recycling and trash management, Khairy imparts important knowledge and pleads with the public to do their part in preserving planet earth.
Among the issues are freeing the roads of illegally parked cars that makes manoeuvring the Alam Flora dumpster a job for only the skilful.
He also advises residents to separate their trash, and says that many still however persist in dumping paper, plastic and glass refuse into the same trash bag that in turn over-burdens landfills as recycling cannot be carried out effectively.
“We must reduce the pressure on landfills so that we don’t have to build more landfills in this country and we want to encourage people to recycle and we also want to encourage people to contribute towards the environment and also waste management in this country,” Khairy says.
He also advised the general public to refrain from littering and to change their negative habits for the sake of the environment.
Highlighting the importance of using reusable bags instead of plastic bags when shopping for groceries, he said the “no plastic bag” rule adopted by the Malacca state government was a good move everyone should emulate as part of “sustainable living.”
“We have a role to play in looking after our environment. Let’s face it, we only have one of this world. We only have one earth and it’s our job to look after it.”

AG Mohamed Apandi Ali is asking for the death sentence to be imposed on nine Filipinos.
KUANTAN: The Attorney-General’s Chambers has filed an appeal against a decision by the Kota Kinabalu High Court in imposing a life imprisonment on nine Filipinos convicted in the Lahad Datu intrusion case.
Attorney-General Mohamed Apandi Ali said the notice of appeal was filed last July 27, a day after the sentence was meted out by Judge Stephen Chung on grounds that the punishment did not commensurate with the offence committed.
“The law provides the death sentence for the offence. So, we will appeal for them to be imposed the death sentence, or at least on their leader,” he told reporters when met after opening the annual prosecutors conference here today.
The conference, attended by 465 deputy public prosecutors nationwide, was held at the Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Convention centre here.
Last July 26, Chung sentenced the nine Filipinos to life imprisonment after finding them guilty of waging war against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong.
The are Atik Hussin Abu Bakar, 45, Basad H Manuel, 41, Ismail Yasin, 76, Virgilio Nemar Patulada @ Mohammad Alam Patulada, 52, Salib Akhmad Emali, 63, Al Wazir Osman, 61, Tani Lahaddahi, 63, Julham Rashid, 69, and Datu Amir Bahar Hushin Kiram, 53.
In another development, Mohamed Apandi said he welcomed the establishment of the Special Cyber Court, which would begin operations on Sept 1, as it would expedite disposal of cyber-related cases, which currently took up to a year.
“We will also study the need to set up a cyber unit, but as of now, we already have a deputy public prosecutor at the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission, as well as the Commercial and Cyber Unit, which is headed by Abdul Rashid Daud.
“We will also provide training to existing deputy public prosecutors to enhance their knowledge and skills relating to cyber laws.”
He said the Attorney-General’s Chambers would also give advice to the police on cyber offences as they were among offences that were difficult to prove.
Meanwhile, in his speech, Mohamed Apandi emphasised the importance of integrity, especially among deputy public prosecutors, and he said he would not hesitate to take action against the corrupt ones.
“Let us not open the doors to any quarters to tarnish the good name of the Attorney-General’s Chambers.”
He said they should be prepared to face whatever challenges and threats that come with the job and to emulate Anthony Kevin Morais, who died while doing his job.

UUM survey also shows a handful view IS as helping oppressed Muslims while the atrocities are no more than Western propaganda and never took place.
PETALING JAYA: A recent study has shown that the majority of students in the country’s private and public universities are oblivious about the Islamic State (IS) militant group.
The survey conducted by University Utara Malaysia (UUM) political lecturer and researcher Dr Mohd Azizuddin Mohd Sani, involved 1,280 students from four regions in Peninsular Malaysia.
“Almost all survey respondents did not really understand IS. For example, some were unable to identify if IS was a Sunni, Shia, Salafi or Sufi group,” Dr Mohd Azizuddin was reported as saying in The Star Online.
The good news however is that of those who did know of the terror group, over 80 per cent rejected it outright, with the rest while not showing outward support for the group, did not react negatively to it either.
“Only a small group of respondents seemed interested in IS. The number is below 20 per cent. They do not subscribe to the IS ideology, but they sympathise with what’s happening in Syria.”
Mohd Azizuddin said this group also perceived the IS as helping oppressed Muslims. The respondents also chose not to focus on the beheadings or other atrocities the militants carried out as some felt it was only Western propaganda and did not really take place.
“They see the atrocities, but they also see a group that is fighting Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad and the western powers. They only accept IS on this level. I don’t think they accept the brutality of IS. They also do not think it is right. But they also know that in wars, things like this happen,” he said.
Reviewing their replies, Mohd Azizuddin said it was clear the respondents had little knowledge of the goings-on in Syria and the world besides begin too caught up with their own lives and relying too much on social media updates and not the actual news for their information.
“Even though social media is an important propaganda tool for IS, what surprised us is that some students feel that their peers are the ones who influence them. For example, their friends come up to them and broach the subject of IS,” he said, adding that many supported the concept of the IS but not the violence the militants perpetrated on others.
The study was commissioned by the Youth and Sports Ministry and is due to be published soon.

The women, family and community ministry says 63% of working women, aged between 23 and 39, resign to fulfil their husband's wishes to look after the children.

PETALING JAYA: Malaysian women continue to abandon their careers to look after their families, frustrating the Women, Family and Community Ministry’s efforts to retain mothers in the workforce.
Minister Rohani Karim said to overcome this problem, the ministry had been working closely with Talent Corp since last year to bring back married women into the labour force.
She said 63% of working women, aged between 23 and 39, in Malaysia quit their jobs after having children.
“They are in their prime. Most resign to comply with their husband’s wishes to stay at home and look after their children.
“This has derailed the government’s efforts to have 59% of women in the labour force by 2020,” she said, adding that at present the female workforce was at 55%.
Rohani said this in her speech at the Women in Leadership Summit and Exhibition at the Sunway Resort Hotel and Spa in Bandar Sunway near here.
She said there was a mismatch in the number of women finishing their tertiary studies and those at work.
She said local universities registered 68% female students, but only 55% are in the workforce.
“There is a mismatch in the number of female graduates and the number who work after having children.”
She pointed out there was also a gender gap in the type of courses enrolled by male and females.
During tertiary studies, females were mostly registered in arts and social science courses, causing them to earn lower than their male counterparts who do courses that lead them to jobs in the engineering, manufacturing and construction sectors, she said
During a press conference later, the minister said to encourage married women to rejoin the workforce, the government kick-started the “Career Comeback” programme last year.
About 190 married women have rejoined the workforce since last year.
Rohani encouraged women who chose to stay at home to get home-based jobs, such as doing translation work or online businesses.
She said married women in Japan and Korea continued to work part-time and found it easier to go back into the workforce after raising their children.

PKR Youth Chief Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad says sudden statement by PTPTN shows it has failed to resolve its longstanding repayment issue with solid action plans.
PETALING JAYA: PKR today slammed the National Higher Education Fund Corporation (PTPTN) over its latest statement that it cannot guarantee full loans to new students due to low repayments by borrowers.
The party’s youth chief, Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad, in a statement, said PTPTN’s decision was disappointing and said the body had failed to resolve its longstanding repayment issue with solid action plans.
“Although we understand the issues faced by PTPTN, the corporation must also realise that it is the main source of funding for many Malaysians who want to further their studies.
“This decision (to limit funding) will not only impact students, but also affect the future of Malaysia, which already has very limited room for higher education.”
Nik Nazmi said the rise in cost of living must be taken into account, before imposing terms of repayment on borrowers.
Similar considerations should also be made before limiting funding for new students as many parents ended up paying more than half of their monthly wages for their children’s education, he added.
“Without PTPTN, or other means of funding, the majority of Malaysians will face difficulties in furthering their studies, especially when they have to resort to borrowing from families, friends or, worse, loan sharks.”
Therefore, Nik Nazmi urged the government to review the decision to limit funding for new students.
“Don’t gamble on Malaysia’s future when it is PTPTN and the government which has slacked off. Fix yourselves before punishing the people who are already oppressed.”
Yesterday, Bernama quoted PTPTN Chairman Shamsul Anuar Nasarah as saying the corporation was not able to give 100% loans to students who wish to further their studies at public institutions of higher learning (IPTA) because the loan recovery did not meet the target.
He said although the loan recovery had improved recently, it still had not reached the target.

Police inaction against those behind 1MDB is not helping the image of the police force, says PKR Vice-President Rafizi Ramli.

PETALING JAYA: PKR lawmaker Rafizi Ramli is looking into the possibility of lodging a police report against Inspector-General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar over the 1MDB issue.
He claimed the top cop had failed to act on reports made against those linked to the alleged embezzlement of 1MDB funds.
“If Khalid continues to act this way, I’ll discuss with my lawyers on perhaps lodging a police report against him,” said the PKR vice-president in a statement today.
He alleged that the police inaction on matters surrounding 1MDB was in contrast to their quick stern action against those, including himself, who criticised the state investment firm and Prime Minister Najib Razak.
“I was contacted by the Sungai Buloh police yesterday, informing me that I am being investigated for my speech in front of the Sungai Buloh Prison on Aug 10 during the gathering to celebrate (former Opposition leader) Anwar Ibrahim’s 69th birthday.
“I was also informed that the investigation papers would be referred to the deputy public prosecutor on Aug 25.
“(And) Last Saturday, three student activists, who held a briefing session on the #TangkapMO1 rally, were detained and handcuffed by police in Seri Iskandar. They were remanded for three days.”
The Pandan MP added that these actions were not helping the police image, especially in a situation where the public was already angered by the back-to-back revelations alleging misappropriation of funds from 1MDB.
“What more when the same actions (taken against Najib and 1MDB critics) did not apply to the main individuals behind 1MDB.”
Khalid, in response, told Malaysiakini that police would look into it if Rafizi proceededs to lodge a report against him.
“If there is basis for an investigation, surely it will be investigated,” Khalid was quoted as saying in the news portal.
He also told Rafizi to read the news so he could be updated on the latest developments on police investigations into 1MDB.
“I have been making regular statements on this and the last (statement) was that we are discussing it with the attorney-general now,” he told the portal.
Khalid, in a press conference last week, said police had completed the first phase of the investigation into 1MDB and were waiting for further orders from the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC).

Umno lawmaker regrets the entire episode, vows to never write anything involving the King.
PETALING JAYA: Langkawi MP Nawawi Ahmad has apologised to the King for linking the monarch to Malaysian Official 1 (MO1), named in the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) suits pertaining to 1MDB.
In a statement, the Umno lawmaker said he made the apology on his own accord, without any pressure from any party.
Nawawi said he did not mean to link the King to the DoJ suit in a social media post, but his comments were made viral by people who did not understand what he was trying to say.
As a son of Kedah and a Malaysian who loved and gave his loyalty to his King, Nawawi said he regretted what had happened.
“The King is clean and pure, from all political matters, and is not linked, not even a molecule, to the DoJ suit and 1MDB issue,” he said, adding he took full responsibility for the issue.
“I regret this entire incident, and vow to be more careful in future when making comments on social media.
“I promise to never write anything involving the King, who is, as Sultan, exalted by all in the country.”
Nawawi apologised once more to the King and begged for forgiveness. He also apologised to the Kedah royal family and vowed to avoid commenting on issues like this on social media.
He also offered an apology to all Malaysians, and stressed that the confusion surrounding the issue arose from him alone, and did not involve any government or party.
Nawawi had recently courted controversy by saying that according to the Federal Constitution, the “Agong is the MO1”.
Many notable figures, including former Umno Deputy President Muhyiddin Yassin and former Kedah Menteri Besar Mukhriz Mahathir, had demanded that Nawawi apologise for issuing the “treasonous” statement.
A total of eight police reports have been lodged against him to date, including one filed by former Langkawi Umno member Anina Saadudin.
The DoJ had filed civil suits on July 20 saying that over US$3.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB.
The DoJ had named Riza Aziz, who is Prime Minister Najib Razak’s stepson, Low Taek Jho (better known as Jho Low), and Abu Dhabi government officials Khadem al-Qubaisi and Mohamed Ahmed Badawy Al-Husseiny, as well as an individual named only as MO1.

Let’s debate on claims, PKR tells Umno Youth



PKR Youth Deputy Chief Dr Afif Bahardin has called for a debate on claims by a Umno Youth leader that three individuals were behind the planned ouster of the prime minister.

GEORGE TOWN: Let’s have a debate on “three individuals” allegedly plotting to topple the prime minister, PKR Youth Deputy Chief Dr Afif Bahardin told his Umno counterpart today.
Dr Afif called on Umno Youth Deputy Chief Khairul Azwan Harun to come for a debate, with PKR willing to sponsor the venue in Penang.
“In reference to the comments made by Khairul, who asserted that a conspiracy of the highest order was afoot to topple the prime minister, we would like to invite him for an open debate.
“The debate would be titled ‘DoJ Summons: A conspiracy to topple the prime minister?’,”Afif said in a statement today.
On July 26, Khairul lodged a police report at the Dang Wangi police headquarters, alleging a plot to topple PM Najib Razak.
He alleged that former Bank Negara Malaysia Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz, former Attorney-General Abdul Gani Patail and former Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Chief Abu Kassim Mohamed were believed to be involved in the conspiracy.
Gani denied claims of involvement in such a conspiracy, while Kassim has remained silent.

 Suspect’s wife claims man was upset his own two children were not getting the love and attention from their grandmother.

PETALING JAYA: Noor Amila Edrus Norsyam was killed by his brother-in-law due to jealousy, reported China Press today.
The daily quoted the suspect’s wife, who only wanted to be known as Nazura, as saying her husband was jealous and unhappy because Amila was getting all the attention from his stepmother, compared with his own two children.
Amila and Nazura shared the same father, Norsyam Jali, 63.
Amila was the son of Norsyam’s fourth wife while Nazura was the daughter of the man’s second wife.
Amila was raised by Nazura’s mother since he was a baby and was much loved by the woman, said the report.
Nazura said her mother had on occasion scolded the son-in-law for being harsh on Amila.
She said her husband had beaten her several times, but she continued to tolerate it for the sake of their two small children.
She urged netizens to stop circulating pictures of her with her husband on social media.
Amila, who lived with his father and stepmother in Jinjang Utara, was reported missing on Aug 11 after going to a nearby mosque for prayers.
His body was found in a bush in Kampung Kemensah, Hulu Kelang, last week.
A 26-year-old man, who works as a mechanic, helped police recover the body and is currently under remand.

Trio is charged under Section 56(1)(g) of the Immigration Act 1959/63 (Act 155), and Section 34 of the Penal Code punishable under Section 56(1)(aa) of the same act.
 

PETALING JAYA: Three Singaporeans who made headlines recently for verbally abusing a Malaysian Immigration Department officer, pleaded not guilty today to having obstructed him from carrying out his duties at the Pekan Nenas Immigration Depot in Pontian, Johor.
According to a report in the Singapore Straits Times, the mother, freelance worker Quek Chin Fern, 42; her son Miguel Lim, 19; and daughter Cheryl Isabella Lim, 18; were alleged to have committed the offence on Aug 12 while parked in the car exit lane at the Sultan Iskandar Customs, Immigration and Quarantine complex at about 3.30pm on Aug 12.
The trio were charged under Section 56(1)(g) of the Immigration Act 1959/63 (Act 155), read out together under Section 34 of the Penal Code and punishable under Section 56(1)(aa) of the same act.
Presiding over the case was judge Salawati Djambari, who allowed bail at RM10,000 with one Malaysian surety for each of the accused and set Sept 5 for the next mention.
If found guilty each accused could be fined not more than RM10,000 (S$3,350) or face a maximum five-year jail term.
Immigration prosecuting officer A Vikneswaran prosecuted the case while counsel Goh Sze Han represented the Singaporeans.
Photos of the trio went viral shortly after the alleged incident and news reports claimed the single mother and her teenage children were arrested after they refused to lower the back tinted window of the vehicle they were in, so the immigration officer could carry out his inspection.
It was also claimed all three verbally abused the officer and hurled accusations at him.
They were headed back to Singapore when the alleged incident occurred.

VP Tian Chua says PKR willing to cooperate with Bersatu in choosing seats to contest in coming general election.
PETALING JAYA: PKR is prepared to let Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) stand in a few of the seats it had contested before.
This was proof that it was willing to cooperate with the newly-formed party in the coming 14th General Election, he said
“We need to be rational. They (Bersatu) can take the seats they can win and we (PKR) will take seats we can win,” PKR Vice-President Tian Chua told FMT.
The Batu MP, however, did not give any details as to which seats PKR was willing to give up.
Yesterday, Bersatu pro-tem President Muhyiddin Yassin said the party was looking at several PKR and PAS seats for the coming GE14.
He said the party had identified suitable constituencies to contest in.
Meanwhile, PAS Research Centre Director Mohd Zuhdi Marzuki said the Islamist party would discuss division of seats for the GE14 with Ikatan, its ally in the Gagasan Sejahtera (Gagasan).
“Because PAS is now in Gagasan, the question of division of seats will have to be discussed within the bloc first and not with parties not in Gagasan.
“After it is discussed within Gagasan, only then will we discuss with PKR, whom we are still cooperating with. As for Bersatu, so far we do not have a pact with them.”
PAS had severed political ties with DAP last year and is refusing to work with PAS splinter party Amanah. Both DAP and Amanah are part of Pakatan Harapan, along with PKR.
Zuhdi was also of the opinion that a one-on-one fight was not the best formula for Malaysia’s political welfare.
“This formula would cast aside the small new parties which represent a certain segment of voters. In fact, this formula does not contribute to the effort of a thriving democracy.”

Chief executive Ben Ismail is eagerly awaiting delivery of the first of 66 Airbus A330-900 neo jetliners that will ply the route.
PETALING JAYA: If a good airport deal can be struck, AirAsia X, Asia’s biggest long-haul low-carrier airline will once again be flying in style to London, at least by 2018.
In a report by Airline ratings.com, chief executive of AirAsia X, Ben Ismail said he was awaiting the delivery of the first of 66 new Airbus A330-900 neo (new engine option) jetliners that will ply what he described as a “very sexy” route.
He credited AirAsia’s founder and group chief executive for this, saying Tony Fernandes, “has done very well in the past trying to find routes that are very sexy where everyone dreams to go.”
He was referring to the destinations of London and Paris that were a huge success until the high cost of operations brought things to a standstill.
“With the new aircraft, I’m quite confident we can make some sort of money,” Ben said.
Next on the agenda is securing an airport deal attractive enough to kickstart operations in the right direction.
“For us, it’s all about the airport deal. If we can find a very attractive airport deal with good takeoff and landing slots, we’ll go for that.
“We’re confident we can stimulate any airport that we go into so (in London) it may be Stansted, it may be Gatwick or, if I’m the luckiest person in the world, Heathrow would be great,” Ben added enthusiastically.
Other Euro destinations being considered for the long-term are Rome and Frankfurt, Ben said, adding that the group was adamant it would not shut down its Indonesian subsidiary, which this year discontinued its four-weekly A330 flights from Melbourne and Sydney to Bali after suffering heavy losses.
AirAsia X, although of separate ownership from its short-haul cousin, Indonesia AirAsia, faced serious regulatory problems with the Indonesian Government after an Airbus A320 belonging to the latter crashed in December 2014, killing all 162 people on board.
“We’re trying to look at the business entirely – how it’s going to fit into the whole vision,” Ismail says of Indonesia AirAsia X, which now has just one route – from Jakarta to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, launched in December 2015.
“We’re reviewing it with regulators there to see how we can move forward. It’s still going to exist but whether it’s going to fall within one company or two, we don’t know yet,” the report on Airline ratings.com said.

Throwing Namewee in jail not the best way to deal with such problems, says Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism and Taoism Honorary Secretary-General Prematilaka KD Serisena.
PETALING JAYA: A non-Muslim religious council has pointed out that people need a platform to vent their frustrations and that the best way to deal with them is to hear them out.
Speaking to FMT, Malaysian Consultative Council of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism and Taoism (MCCBCHST) Honorary Secretary-General Prematilaka KD Serisena said only through engaging the people could there be a “dynamic democracy” in the country.
“Where do people channel their frustrations when anything they say, that goes against the status quo, is labelled as seditious? People need to be heard.”
He was commenting on controversial rapper Namewee’s four-day remand from today over his “Oh My God” music video.
Namewee, whose real name is Wee Meng Chee, 33, was arrested at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport yesterday after returning from an overseas trip.
While admitting that he had not watched the video, Prematilaka said sending the rapper to jail was not the right move.
“Throwing him in jail is not the right move and it’s not going to help. He’s going to become even worse.
“People of religion need to engage and teach those who need to vent their frustrations.
“As the government is not willing to listen and it expects people to comply, there has to be serious reforms.”
Prematilaka claimed that he had recently spoken to a classmate of the infamous criminal Wong Swee Chin, better known as Botak Chin.
“This classmate told me that Wong used to be among the top five in his class back in school. He took up a life of crime after he was refused a bank loan and on being told that Chinese could not get loans.”
Prematilaka added that the way ministers in the country acted only served to heighten frustration among the people.
He cited Rural and Regional Development Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob’s call for a “Malay” Low Yat, now known as Mara Digital Mall, or Low Yat 2.
“Ministers feel that they are God’s gift to the earth. Sorry to burst their bubble, but they’re not. They need to be responsible in the way they use words and be respectful of the people who elected them in the first place.”

Project in Butterworth will provide better homes on site currently filled with squatter houses, says Lim Guan Eng. VIDEO INSIDE
GEORGE TOWN: Developers are invited to build a state government low-cost housing project in Butterworth via a competitive open tender, Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng announced today.
He said 600 low-cost housing units will be built on a 13.3 acre-site leasehold land by the state government in Ujung Batu, in Bagan Dalam.
Lim said the project was to alleviate the present-day squatter problem, and that land there will be developed into homes and mixed development, with related infrastructure and facilities.
“The state government will continue to give emphasis to upgrade and provide better housing facilities for the squatters.
“Presently there are around 400 squatter houses in the area.
“This development will transform Ujong Batu into a modern enclave, offering a conducive environment and a sustainable vibrant community,” he said in a press conference in Komtar here, today.
Lim said state-investment arm Penang Development Corporation (PDC) has appointed project managers, and will invite companies to participate in the “Proposed Development Agreement” (PDA).
He said the winning bidder will undertake the design, building and completion of the whole development area in accordance with specific criteria and guidelines of the Request for Proposal (RFP).
“Residents and squatters affected by the development will be offered compensation in accordance with state Land Guidelines,” Lim said.
The development components formulated for the project are :

600 units low cost housing with a total area of 650 sq ft,and with maximum density of 150 units/acre (subject to the exact requirement), and mixed development with maximum density of 120 units/acre;
Public facilities, namely two futsal courts and a hall that can accommodate four badminton courts which will be handed over to the Seberang Perai Municipal Council (MPSP);
Common areas to be equipped with safety features, such as CCTV;
Access card for both the gate entrance and lift; and
Facade treatment reflecting high-end finishing for windows and doors

The low-cost housing project is expected to be completed in phases and will be developed simultaneously with the mixed-development project.
However, the whole development project will take about 10 years to be completed.
Interested companies who wish to participate in the PDA can purchase the tender document for RM1,060 from PDC. The RFP closes on Oct 24.

Local newspaper report on Penang reclamation work irks Penang CM, who asks why no questions are asked of similar work taking place on a larger scale in BN states.

GEORGE TOWN: Penang Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng questioned the integrity of the mainstream media for picking on his state over environmental issues.
“Why only target us all the time,” he asked today, after an English daily reported the degradation of environment resulting from reclamation work taking place on the island.
He said mainstream dailies often turned a blind eye on the environmental issues of states which had “three times” more reclamation work than Penang.
“Why must you only demonise Penang? Why can’t NST write about states that have three times the size of reclamation?
“Malacca had reclamation three times the size (of Penang). So did Perak,” he said of two states under the Barisan Nasional (BN) administration.
“Why don’t they (the NST) write about that instead?”
In its report, The New Straits Times (NST) quoted Universiti Sains Malaysia marine biologist Dr Zulfigar Yasin as saying that more natural disasters will affect the state as a result of excess reclamation on the island.
NST reported Zulfigar as describing the island’s environment situation was akin to “a volcano waiting to erupt”.
He said fishermen, too, would be severely affected as a drop in catch is to be expected in the long run.
Meanwhile, Penang Environment Committee chairman Phee Boon Poh said it respected the experts’ view on the reclamation issue.
He said all parties are welcome to give their point of view on the matter.
“We respect the freedom of experts’ views and expression. All views will be given due consideration.
“We thank them for helping to put forward the pros and cons.”

It is no secret that IS already has sleeper cells in Malaysia, says terrorologist Paneir Selvam.
PETALING JAYA: Islamic State (IS) has proven to be a far-sighted organisation, having appeared to have laid down plans for all possibilities, and executing them when the right time comes.
It is for this reason that the Malaysian counter-terrorism authorities should aim to always be a step ahead of the terror group, and prepare themselves for all sorts of scenarios, said terrorologist R Paneir Selvam.
He also cautioned of a bigger and more organised attack in the country, saying that IS might be saving their best assets for last.
“Our special branch has done a good job, but it has to bear in mind that IS may only be testing the waters at the moment, to see how effective our security forces are, while at the same time, identifying their weaknesses and areas that can be manipulated.
“The real attacks may be carried out by individuals least expected to be involved in terrorism acts, profiled as someone with no criminal background, high intellect, and a life that appears ordinary to outsiders.
“It is no secret that IS already has sleeper cells in Malaysia,” the chairman of the Association of Legal and Policy Researchers told FMT.
To back up his statement, Paneir cited an article by the ‘New York Times’ which stated that IS had, more than two years ago, deployed its militants back to their home countries to sit an wait for the time when the group can no longer carry its mission effectively in Iraq and Syria.
Deputy Inspector-General of Police Noor Rashid Ibrahim yesterday said the police were keeping tabs on students in private colleges who were believed to be promoting IS ideology.
However, Paneir, a lecturer in terrorism at Help University, believes that the threat of IS attacks may also come from those living near the country’s borders.
“Our borders are porous due to certain factors (such as corruption and IS sympathisers). It is easy to sneak in not only illegal firearms, but also possible militants.”
Last year, a report compiled by the Special Branch over a period of 10 years revealed that a startling 80 per cent of law enforcement and security officers at Malaysian borders were corrupt.
It also stated that many of these officers were directly involved in syndicates smuggling drugs, weapons and humans.

Friend requests pour in after photo of student Ika Syazwani goes viral because of her close resemblance to national badminton hero Lee Chong Wei.

PETALING JAYA: She may be a woman but 24-year-old Ika Syazwani’s almost identical resemblance to national badminton hero Lee Chong Wei has earned her a steady stream of friend requests on Facebook, some even coming from complete strangers.
The excitement to befriend the Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) student came after she posted a congratulatory message to Lee on Facebook for his performance in the Rio Olympics that said: “Congrats my twin! #DatoLCW” accompanied by pictures of herself and Lee placed side by side.
Amazed at their facial similarities, the post was shared many times over, with a steady stream of Facebook users now eager to get to know Ika personally.
“Who knew that people would say I look like Datuk Lee Chong Wei. Maybe its because we have a similar facial structure,” The Star Online quoted Ika as saying.
No stranger to being told she looked like Lee, Ika’s images went viral way back in 2013 and resurfaced recently after the badminton players’s nail-biting performances at the Rio Olympics.
“I always feel like laughing about it because to me, the whole thing is funny. I did not expect it to become viral,” she said, explaining that it could possibly be because her grandmother is Chinese.
A huge fan of Lee’s herself, Ika was glued to the live telecasts of all his matches at the Rio Olympics recently and posted regular updates on Facebook, the English daily reported.
“Datuk Lee is in top form. I was so excited, I even felt like going to Rio. It was even more exciting when Datuk Lee got to the finals. I felt so proud,” she told The Star Online.
“During the finals, he looked like he was tired. Maybe he did not get enough rest because of the semi-finals.
“Overall, Datuk Lee is the best. Even though it was a silver medal, but we know that he is one of the best players in the world. Congratulations once again,” she said.
As avid a badminton fan as she is, Ika is however more into automotive sports like drag racing and drifting but considering her admiration for Lee, she will likely keep following his career until he hangs up his racket for good.

Badminton doubles pair to get houses worth over RM1 million



Property developer JL99 has pledged the pricey reward, to be given to the men as a token of "appreciation and encouragement" for the Olympic silver medal they brought home.
PETALING JAYA: Badminton men’s doubles pair Tan Wee Kiong and Goh V Shem, who won a silver medal in the recently concluded Rio Olympics, will soon be given houses worth more than RM1 million each by one of their sponsors.
Property developer JL99 Group, in a recent Facebook posting, said two units of the Lakepark Residence in Pusat Bandar Utara, in the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, would be presented as a token of appreciation and encouragement to the duo.
JL99 Group Chairman Jeff Lee said in the post: “Congratulations! We are proud to be one of your sponsors. You bring us pride. Malaysia Boleh!”
The message also contained an invitation to the duo to be present at the developer’s new show gallery near the Kuala Lumpur Middle Ring Road 2 this weekend, presumably to “officially” receive the reward.
Tan and Goh fell to Fu Haifeng-Zhang Nan from China in the finals, but not without a fight.
This is not the only incentive that awaits them. By winning the silver medal, they will receive a RM300,000 cash reward and RM3,000 monthly pension announced by the National Sports Council.
They will also drive home a new Proton Suprima each, courtesy of DRB Hicom.

Shahrol Halmi was a mere pawn but the powers that be hope his incarceration will help them wash their hands of the 1MDB Scandal.

KUALA LUMPUR: The only request by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), and not part of five recommendations, was for 1MDB’s former Chief Shahrol Halmi as well to be investigated, said Petaling Jaya Utara MP Tony Pua in a statement.
Many believe the ring-fence imposed by the Cabinet, and willingly accepted by the IGP, was nothing more than a strategy to make Shahrol the scapegoat, he added. “It appears he will be blamed for the multi-billion dollar 1MDB scam.”
He noted that Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Khalid Abu Bakar disclosed on Friday that police have completed the first phase of investigations into 1MDB. “Khalid said it’s restricted, as ordered by the Cabinet, to PAC’s five recommendations.”
The five PAC recommendations, as pointed out by DAP Parliamentary Leader Lim Kit Siang, has nothing to do with police investigations, agreed Pua. “They relate to the corporate reorganisation of the heavily indebted company.”
For example, said Pua, the PAC recommended the 1MDB Board of Advisors be dissolved, the Ministry of Finance assume ownership of the property assets and that 1MDB “should avoid excessive debt”.
So, continued the MP, it clearly appears that Shahrol will be made a scapegoat to ease pressure on Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak. “The Prime Minister failed to take any concrete action for the losses 1MDB suffered.”
The UK Guardian named 1MDB the “world’s largest financial scandal”, pointed out Pua.
The powers that be hope that with Shahrol’s incarceration, a mere pawn, they would be able to wash their hands on the scandal, he lamented. “They want to close the lid on the ugliest chapter of Malaysia’s history.”
However, by doing so, the police would once again make complete fools of themselves, warned Pua. “This is no different from the Altantuya murder scandal in 2006.”
Chief Inspector Azilah Hadri and Corporal Sirul Azhar Umar, members of the elite Unit Tindakan Khas were found guilty of murdering the Mongolian woman, he reminded. “However, no motive was ever presented by police and prosecution.”
“No motive was found by the court and they were condemned to death.”
In 1MDB’s case, if only Shahrol were to be charged and found guilty, Pua said a similar question could be asked, what motive was there for Shahrol to carry out a multi-billion dollar global embezzlement exercise.
Shahrol, referred to as “1MDB Officer 2” in the US Department of Justice (DoJ) suit to seize USD1 billion of laundered 1MDB assets, was never disclosed as an individual beneficiary of the stolen funds, argued Pua.
The beneficiaries of the loot were Low Taek Jho, Riza Aziz, Khadem Al-Qubaisi and Mohammad Badawy Al-Husseiny.
In addition, said Pua, a “Malaysian Official 1” received a whopping USD731 million from the embezzled proceeds.
In any case, the MP agrees that Shahrol was guilty of participating and facilitating the massive scam. “It was about defrauding the.people.”
He should be charged for abetting “the heinous crime”, demanded Pua. “However, he is but a cog in the wheel of the 1MDB scandal.”
1MĎB may be the greatest travesty of justice, similar to the Altantuya murder, said Pua. “The real conspirators and crooks, who had benefited immensely from the crimes, are scot free.”

Policemen bitten by couple at roadblock



Male suspect tries to seize policemen's firearm, while his wife flashes policemen, daring them to catch her.


PETALING JAYA: Being wounded in a scuffle with a criminal or in a shootout are expected job hazards for a policeman.
But being bitten by a rowdy couple would be the last “hazard” any cop would expect in the line of duty. But that’s exactly what two policemen experienced in Kuching, Sarawak.
According to Kuching police chief ACP Abang Ahmad Abang Julai, the incident occurred about 2am in Jalan Matang Baru, when policemen flagged down a couple in a Perodua Kancil, during a road block.
When the cops checked the vehicle’s boot, the couple got abusive and started scolding the policemen using vulgar words.
The 44-year-old male suspect even tried to snatch the HK-MP5 held by a Lance Corporal manning the roadblock, while his 41-year-old wife unbuttoned her shirt and flashed at them, daring them to arrest her. She was then arrested with the help of a policewoman.
It was during the process of arrest that the suspects bit the hands of two policemen – a Lance Corporal and a Constable.
The police believe the jobless couple were intoxicated, and have remanded them for four days to facilitate investigations.
The case is being investigated under Section 186 of the Penal Code for obstructing a public servant in the discharge of his public functions.

Harris Salleh denies claims he abused his power, took revenge against late tycoon who was once considered 'most hated man' by Sabahans.
KOTA KINABALU: The Kota Kinabalu High Court is hearing a libel case brought by former Chief Minister Harris Salleh against author Shaari Isa, the Kinabalu Sabah Times reported.
Harris is suing Shaari over allegations made in the latter’s book “Vendetta and Abuse of Power: Quest for Justice in the Land Below the Wind – Political Vilification Against Syed Kechik in Sabah (1975-2013)”.
He is also suing two others, namely Syed Salem, the younger brother of Syed Kechik Syed Mohamed Al-Bukhary, and MPH Group which published the book in 2014.
According to the portal, Harris claims that Syed Salem is the source of the allegations in the book.
Among the allegations mentioned in the book are that Harris had abused his power as Sabah chief minister and was vindictive in seizing Syed Kechik’s properties in Sabah following Berjaya taking over the Sabah Government.
A lawyer from Kedah, Syed Kechik was said to have been the real force behind former chief minister Mustapha Harun’s iron rule under Usno for nine years until 1976.
As a result, Syed Kechik was said to be regarded as the “most hated man” by Sabahans for many years. Hence, his expulsion from Sabah was a theme of the Berjaya Party’s election campaign in 1976, the Kinabalu Sabah Times reported.
Syed Kechik passed away in 2009 at the age of 81 years.
Berjaya, which swept to power under Fuad Stephens, ended Mustapha’s rule in the Sabah elections in April 1976. However, just two months later, Stephens perished in an air crash and Harris took over as chief minister.
Harris and Syed Kechik were bitter foes. The former had also allegedly resigned twice from the state cabinet, first as finance minister and later as industrial development minister, because of the animosity between both men.
The bitterness culminated after 20 years with a judge ordering the Sabah Government to compensate Syed Kechik RM40 million for 2,500 acres it had seized to build Universiti Sabah Malaysia (UMS). The land was owned by Zara Sdn Bhd, named after Syed Kechik’s eldest daughter.
Zara is married to Syed Kechik’s nephew, Syed Mokhtar al-Bukhary, who is currently the richest Bumiputera in Malaysia.
According to Kinabalu Sabah Times, it was also under Harris’ tenure as chief minister that Sabah had revoked the vast timber concessions given to Syed Kechik by the previous government under Mustapha.

Rapper Namewee remanded for 4 days



He is being investigated for 'defiling a place of worship with intention to insult the religion'. VIDEO INSIDE

GEORGE TOWN: Controversial rapper Namewee was today handed a four-day remand order for “defiling a place of worship with intention to insult the religion”.
Namewee, whose real name is Wee Meng Chee, was taken to the Penang courthouse at 10.25am, with his hands cuffed behind his back and led in by two police officers.
Assistant Court Registrar Ahmad Tajudin Zaini granted the remand order for four days, allowing the police to question Namewee under Section 295 of the Penal Code. This section carries a jail term of up to two years or a fine, or both.
The 33-year-old Johorean was arrested the moment he landed at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport yesterday, and was later taken to Penang where he was held in police custody.
According to George Town police chief ACP Mior Faridalathrash Wahid, the arrest is part of an ongoing investigation into Namewee’s controversial music video “Oh My God”.
The four-minute clip, which was directed and produced by Namewee for Taiwanese band Nine-One-One, was shot in several places of worship in Penang.
This has outraged certain sectors of the public, with 20 NGOs lodging a police report against the rapper who had also courted controversy through a previous video, “Negarakuku” which mocked the national anthem.

Sarawak deputy chief minister ticks off MTUC Sarawak for assuming the state government would prioritise employment for locals at the expense of quality.

PETALING JAYA: A Sarawak Deputy Chief Minister has hit out at the Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC) Sarawak for assuming the state government would prioritise employment for locals at the expense of quality.
“We aren’t stupid,” Dr James Jemut Masing was quoted by The Borneo Post as saying in response to MTUC Sarawak chairman Mohd Ibrahim Hamid’s statement that competency must not be compromised in giving priority to Sarawakians in recruitment of personnel.
The Sarawak government recently froze work permits for Petronas staff to work in the East Malaysian state to ensure the national oil company would be fair and transparent in engaging Sarawakians with regard to its operations in the state.
The decision to implement a moratorium was prompted by complaints from Sarawak Petronas officers whose services were terminated or who were retrenched in a restructuring exercise.
Petronas also abolished 29 permanent positions, according to non-profit group Suarah Petroleum Group (SPG).
Sarawak Chief Minister Adenan Satem has since threatened to cancel work permits of non-Sarawakians if Petronas does not cooperate with the state government on its demand that the oil firm increase its number of local workers.
Masing also noted that both the public and private sectors in Sarawak adhered to a standard operating procedure (SOP), which stipulated that non-Sarawakians could only be hired when locals did not apply for the job after a vacancy was advertised.
“I don’t know whether Petronas follows this SOP when employing non-Sarawakians.”
He said this SOP that the Sarawak government follows would weed out non-qualified local Sarawakians from being employed and work permits would be issued to non-Sarawakians in accordance to the state laws.
On a related matter, Mohd Ibrahim had claimed that the state government was quick to protect the 13 Sarawakian senior executives retrenched by Petronas while ignoring the hundreds of thousands of foreign workers in the state.
To this, Masing said Mohd Ibrahim was either confused or in the dark over what the Immigration Department has been doing over the years.
“Sarawak authorities are repatriating hundreds of illegal workers every year, once they are caught. They don’t turn a blind eye to illegal workers as accused,” the Borneo Post reported Masing as saying.

Controversial preacher says strengths include hard-working attitude and various sacrifices made by parents, teachers and students.
PETALING JAYA: Controversial preacher Ridhuan Tee Abdullah has outlined the strengths of Chinese schools and urged government and religious schools to step out of their comfort zones.
In his weekly column in Sinar Harian, Tee said while he was always seen as “attacking” Chinese schools for refusing to implement the government’s agenda in relation to Bahasa Malaysia, the strength of the Chinese and their schools could not be denied.
One of the strengths of Chinese schools, Tee said, was hard work, adding that the Chinese were synonymous with hard work and the struggle for survival.
Another strength, Tee said, was that the Chinese did not believe in depending on the government alone when it came to acquiring teaching and learning resources.
He said parents who sent their children to Chinese schools, would not hesitate to fork out money for fees related to extra classes and facilities.
Tee said another strength was the fund raising activities of Chinese schools, which held annual fund-raising drives to raise funds that went towards better infrastructure.
Another strength, Tee said, was the quality of teaching and learning of Mathematics, as well as the willingness to have extra classes on Saturdays, especially for “killer subjects” such as Bahasa Malaysia and English.
He also said the Chinese school management boards association, known as Dong Jiao Zong – which combined the management boards of schools, headmasters, teachers and parent-teacher associations – was another strength of Chinese schools.
Another plus, according to Tee, was the frequent meet-the-parents sessions that were held no less than three times a year.
“In national schools, if a meet-the-parents session happens once a year, it is considered good.
“Other meetings in national schools are geared towards solat hajat (prayers), air yasin, buka puasa and raya receptions,” he said, adding that even then, not many parents turn up.
Tee called on the Education Ministry to carry out a holistic study as to why there were a growing number of Malays opting for Chinese schools, while there were less Chinese entering national schools.
Earlier this month, retired educationist Prof Dr Teo Kok Seong told FMT that a two-year study by the National Education Advisory Council had showed that Chinese-medium schools would become increasingly multiracial, with Malay enrolment at 18 per cent now.

Denying speculation Oscar winner's pullout from hosting event for Clinton due to ties with scandal, Leonardo DiCaprio's rep says it's just a scheduling conflict.
PETALING JAYA: Oscar-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio’s decision to drop out of hosting a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton is due to a scheduling conflict and has nothing to do with the 1MDB scandal.
According to The Hollywood Reporter (THR), Josh Schwerin, a spokesman with the Clinton campaign, said any suggestion that the 1MDB scandal was connected to the Titanic star pulling out was completely false.
“It’s not at all true,” the entertainment portal quoted him as saying, adding that DiCaprio was also “gracious” enough to find a new host for the Democratic presidential nominee’s event on Tuesday.
DiCaprio’s rep, Shawn Sachs, also explained that scheduling conflict forced the actor to bow out.
The denials came following a report on Saturday by People magazine that DiCaprio would be in New York until Wednesday as he was filming a movie, although not as an actor.
It was reported last month that DiCaprio was in an “awkward and potentially legally-perilous situation” because of his ties to Wolf of Wall Street producers, Riza Aziz and Joey McFarland as well as controversial businessman Low Taek Jho (Jho Low).
The actor was referred to as “Hollywood Actor 1” in a suit filed by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) on July 20 pertaining to misappropriation of 1MDB funds.
The entertainment publication reported that the DoJ had noted that DiCaprio went gambling at the Venetian casino, Las Vegas in 2012 along with Low, Riza and McFarland.
Riza and McFarland co-founded Red Granite Pictures which produced the movie that was based on Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker who engaged in rampant corruption and fraud.
Meanwhile, THR also quoted a source with experience planning presidential fundraisers as stating that it would be a “no brainer” to keep DiCaprio away from a Clinton event amid the 1MDB suit and press reports.
In its civil suits last month, the DoJ specifically mentioned how Low had also gambled for approximately seven days at the Venetian Casino in Las Vegas after US$11 million – from funds allegedly siphoned from 1MDB – were deposited into his account at the casino during the same trip in 2012.
DiCaprio, Low, Riza and McFarland had also apparently used money from Low’s account while in Las Vegas, with DoJ records showing a total withdrawal of US$1.15 million in one day.
The US DoJ is alleging that that over US$3.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB, over a period of four years and by multiple individuals, including Malaysian officials and their associates.
It specifically named Riza, who is Prime Minister Najib Razak’s stepson, Jho Low, and Abu Dhabi government officials Khadem al-Qubaisi and Mohamed Ahmed Badawy Al-Husseiny.

Marine biology professor says the massive reclamation works going on in Penang will come to 'bite' the island in the long run.
PETALING JAYA: Penang is opening itself up to the possibility of having more natural disasters like flooding and tsunamis, due to coastal reclamation works going on in full swing, reported New Straits Times today.
The report quoted Dr Zulfigar Yasin, a Universiti Sains Malaysia marine biology professor, saying the reclamation works would also affect the island state’s fishery and tourism industry.
“It is serious enough for the state authorities to know that they are jumping into the unknown. Worse still, Penang’s environment is like a volcano waiting to erupt,” he was quoted saying, adding that the issue was a ticking time bomb.
Massive reclamation works are ongoing at Gurney Drive and the Queensbay area opposite Pulau Jerejak. Three man-made islands are expected to be created in the south of the island to facilitate the RM46 billion Penang Transport Master Plan.
According to Zulfigar, things have changed drastically in Penang in the last 10 years.
“We see rapid and huge reclamation projects for development, especially in the Free Trade Zone, Tanjung Tokong and the proposed southern area.
“Penang’s shape used to be rather jagged, but now, it’s more rounded. This means that most of our coastlines, especially in shallow areas, have been reclaimed,” he said, adding that if such reclamation continues unabated, it would affect people’s livelihood.
The reclamation would also affect the state’s seawater quality, and impact the fishery industry, where fishermen would lose their fishing grounds, he said.
“The obvious index is the price of fish. Before, the common folk ate fish, and the rich ate chicken. These days, it’s the opposite. Everything from the sea is becoming expensive.”
Penang would also lose out on water tourism and medical tourism if the reclamation continues, Zulfigar said.
He urged the authorities to come up with a study on the state’s coastline and to look at the impact of reclamation to mitigate the problem.
“We need a master plan and new guidelines to ensure sustainable development.
“We don’t want a repeat of Batu Ferringhi. The tourist hot-spot was pristine until development set in. We need to learn from mistakes,” he said, adding that reclamation works should be put on hold pending the completion of the study and master plan.

NFC, Public Bank case resumes Oct 21



Public Bank could not agree to the terms of a settlement with NFC Corp on their four-year old case.

KUALA LUMPUR: Public Bank Bhd (PBB), NFC Corp and the latter’s Chairman Mohamad Salleh Ismail have failed to settle a four-year old legal suit.
NFC’s lawyer, Syed Ismat Syed Muhammad, told reporters the bank could not agree on the terms of the proposed settlement. He was disclosing details after meeting High Court judge Justice John Louis O’Hara in chambers.
The bank’s lawyer, Yoong Sin Min, added the trial will resume on October 21. “Salleh will continue with his testimony,” she said.
Salleh had earlier succeeded in obtaining the bank’s domestic inquiry (DI) documents on bank officer, Johari Mohamad, who allegedly leaked details from his (Salleh’s) bank account. Justice O’Hara allowed the application by Salleh and NFC Corp on April 14 on the DI.
Salleh and NFC Corp are suing Public Bank for alleged breach of the Banking and Financial Institution Act (BAFIA). The alleged breach, they claim, facilitated Pandan MP Rafizi Ramli to create a negative public image of NFC Corp.
Salleh and the company claim they suffered irrecoverable losses and bad reputation because the details were leaked from the bank account.

Nazri : Tun M, Muhyiddin have no moral fibre



Umno leader slams the duo as 'desperate' for willing to work with 'sworn enemies' DAP to oust PM Najib.
PETALING JAYA: Former Umno leaders like Dr Mahathir Mohamad and Muhyiddin Yassin are “desperate” to work with “sworn enemies” like the DAP, Umno supreme council member Nazri Aziz said today.
The Malay Mail Online quoted the Padang Rengas MP as saying that the decision by the former Umno president (Mahathir) and deputy president (Muhyiddin) to form Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu), which would work together with the opposition to “destroy” Umno, showed the duo had no moral fibre.
“This is the lowest of the low of politicians. They can sit with their enemy not to form a government but just to bring down Umno.
“This is just how low they can go,” Nazri was quoted saying.
His comment comes following Bersatu protem committee chairman Mahathir’s recent remark that his party was willing to work with DAP despite having differences in opinion over various issues.
The country’s longest serving prime minister had said that one factor that had brought together his party and DAP, was to see Prime Minister Najib Razak unseated.
Mahathir and DAP have decades of “off-colour” history, with the former often accusing the latter of practising racist politics, and the latter accusing Mahathir of ruling with an iron fist.

Hope you are all right, says Najib to Lee



 Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was taken ill while speaking at the country's National Day Rally yesterday.

SINGAPORE: “Heard that you’re not feeling well. I hope you’re all right. Get well soon,” says Prime Minister Najib Razak to Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong via his Twitter account late yesterday.
“Thanks for your good wishes. My doctors tell me I should be OK,” Lee then replied around 2am.
Lee was taken ill while speaking at the country’s National Day Rally (NDR) around 9.40pm yesterday.
Lee, 64, was scheduled to end his English speech at 10pm after delivering his Malay and Mandarin versions at 6.45pm.
Lee managed to continue his speech after almost an hour of rest and wrapped up his speech in 15 minutes.
Immediately after delivering his speech, Lee went to the Singapore General Hospital for a precautionary check-up.
In his NDR speech, Lee had touched on Singapore’s relationship with Malaysia and Indonesia.
Lee described both countries as Singapore’s two most important partners.
Last month, Lee said, he was in Putrajaya, Malaysia, to witness the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding on the High Speed Rail between Singapore and Malaysia.
“PM Najib hosted us to lunch. The durian was good, but the High Speed Rail will be better!,” he said while the large screen behind him showed a photo of him with Najib.

Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department says enactments and laws pertaining to religion and its enforcement fall under the jurisdiction of state governments.

IPOH: Enforcement measures to curb the spread of Shi’ism in the country need to be updated and strengthened, said Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Asyraf Wajdi Dusuki.
He said it was not easy to curb the spread of the ideology as they did not practice it openly.
“Actually it is not easy to deal with deviant teachings, because sometimes they do it in secrecy. I believe in terms of the enactment it is good enough, the most important thing is to strengthen it in terms of enforcement.
“Under the legislation, we cannot take action based on suspicion. If there is evidence, only then can we take action,” he told reporters after opening the Tambun Umno division delegates meeting here yesterday.
He was commenting on the proposal by the Kedah Mufti Department on Wednesday that the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 (Sosma) should be enhanced to curb the spread of Shi’ism in the country.
Asyraf said enactments and laws pertaining to religion and its enforcement fall under the jurisdiction of state governments, while the Federal government only coordinated in terms of the language used in the enactments.
“In the context of Shi’ism, there is consensus among all the states, so let the states (set the enactments), but they should play a more proactive role in matters related to faith.
“In the context of Sosma and so on, if there is proof that (the acts) could harm the country, anyone will have action taken against them by the government,” he said.
In the meantime, Asyraf said in addition to enforcement personnel, the public should also cooperate and play a role to curb the spread of Shi’ism in the country.
“People should always be proactive and work with the authorities to help provide information, if they are aware of deviation (of religion) groups in their areas,” he said.

Datuk Seri Salleh Said Keruak says it would be natural for the prime minister to be selected from Umno since the Malay nationalist party is the biggest party and has the most seats in the BN coalition. ― Bernama picKUALA LUMPUR, Aug 23 ― Under Barisan Nasional (BN) rule, the Malaysian prime minister will always be someone from Umno as it has the most seats in Parliament, party treasurer Datuk Seri Salleh Said Keruak said.

	The communications and multimedia minister, who is from Sabah, said it would be natural for the prime minister to be selected from the Malay nationalist party as per the Westminster parliamentary system, since Umno is the biggest party and has the most seats in the BN coalition.

	“As far as BN is concerned,our position is clear -- leader of the party which commands the majority of seats will be the prime minister.

	“President of Umno who is chairman of BN will be the prime minister. This is how democracy works,” Salleh told Malay Mail Online when contacted.

	He added that even a politician from DAP stood a chance to become PM if he or she commanded the most support in the Dewan Rakyat.

	“Technically if the opposition wins 112 seats in Parliament and they want a non-Malay DAP candidate for Prime Minister, that is legal,” Salleh sarcastically said.

	The Sabahan lawmaker was asked to comment if Malaysia would amend its Constitution to allow a non-Malay prime minister in the future, after Singapore announced that it will amend its constitution to allow future presidents to be elected from ethnic minorities. Singapore’s president, however, does not hold executive powers.

	To this, Salleh said nowhere in the Federal Constitution is it specified that a non-Malay cannot hold the top post, but pointed out that the Singaporean president's position is very much different from the Malaysian prime minister's.

	“The Singapore president is a ceremonial position with no executive powers and the [Malaysian] Constitution does not state the race, religion or gender.

	“Constitutionally speaking, the MP who commands the majority confidence of Parliament becomes the prime minister. It does not state anything more than that and has always been so since Merdeka,” he explained.

	BN component party MCA meanwhile remained optimistic that someday a non-Malay could be instated as prime minister, but conceded that the Malaysian mindset was not ready for such a change.

	The Chinese party's youth wing chief Senator Chong Sin Woon said if a non-Malay gets majority support from the MPs, he or she might stand a chance to be prime minister despite their race.

	“The Constitution only said any MP who received the majority support in the House of Representatives would be the PM, so yes any MP, regardless of race and religion, can be PM of Malaysia,” the deputy education minister II told Malay Mail Online when contacted.

	MCA religious harmony bureau chairman Datuk Seri Ti Lian Ker said Malaysians were still very much divided by racial ideologies and that would not allow for a non-Malay to hold the nation's top government position.

	“That's a hypothetical question. Why not? If there comes a day when it is politically correct to do so?

	“The current political mindset and racial demographic shows that the political willingness to accept a non-Malay leader at the helm is not there yet,” he told Malay Mail Online when contacted.

	Ti added that the racial divide is still a big hurdle for Malaysians to overcome and claimed it is present in various organisations, including national sporting associations and local universities.

	“Taking my point further are all the sports organisation where the Malays are dominant and do not show the openness of accepting a non-Malay at the helm.

	“Sports should be multiracial by nature, but why is it that most organisations are not helmed by non-Malays except for ping-pong and basketball?” he questioned, adding that such a racial split even occurred in universities during the undergraduate student elections.

	Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced Sunday night that the republic will soon amend its constitution to ensure its future presidents can be elected from among the ethnic minorities “from time to time”. The president is the head of state in Singapore and has authority over two major matters: reserves and appointments.

	Malaysia's six prime ministers have all been chosen from Umno despite the party winning general elections as part of the BN bloc with other component parties like MCA, MIC, Gerakan, as well as other parties from Sabah and Sarawak.

	BN mainly comprises race-based parties, hence by default, it contests in constituencies based on racial demographics, making Umno the biggest party as it typically contests the most number of seats in the predominantly Malay country.

PAC chairman Datuk Nur Jazlan Mohamed speaks to member of the media during a press conference at Parliament in Kuala Lumpur, July 9, 2015. — Picture by Yusof Mat Isa JOHOR BARU, Aug 22 — Malaysia is hoping that the United States will not consider an appeal from former al-Qaeda leader, Hambali, to be released from the prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

	Deputy Home Minister Datuk Nur Jazlan Mohamed said this was because if Hambali, or his real name, Riduan Isamuddin, is released from the prison and allowed to return to Southeast Asia, he would become the catalyst for terrorism in the region.

	“According to information gathered by security agencies in this region, terrorist groups or those keen on being terrorists neither have a sophisticated leadership nor the knowledge to obtain weapons and explosives that can cause mass destruction.

	“So, if Hambali is allowed to return home, he can give them his expertise and become their leader,” he told reporters after visiting Johor Home Ministry Complex at Setia Tropika here today.

	Nur Jazlan, who is also Pulai MP, said in Hambali’s case, security factor should come first compared to other factors, including his release, because he was involved in terror attacks which claimed the lives of many innocent people, including the 2002 Bali bombing.

	Hambali was reported to have appeared before the Guantanamo Bay review board on Thursday, asking to be released from the prison with a live video feed of the proceedings, which lasted about 10 minutes, was made available to reporters and other accredited observers at the Pentagon.

	This was the first appearance of Hambali, who has been referred to as the ‘Osama bin Laden of Southeast Asia’ since his arrest in Thailand in August 2003. — Bernama

	KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 22 — Datuk Seri Najib Razak said today that he does not lose any sleep with his haters, though he admitted that some of the comments about him on Facebook angers him.

	The prime minister told a dialogue with student leaders at the launch of Kembara Mahasiswa Nasional, which was posted on his blog today, however that outreach can be done for those who are influenced by misinformation.

	“Haters are those where no matter what we do, they won’t like us.

	“White people say ‘there’s nothing you can do’. So don’t. Don’t lose any sleep with this group,” Najib said at the dialogue called “60 minutes with the prime minister”, when asked about how he handles his haters.

	The prime minister and Umno president also said he occasionally reads comments on Facebook about him.

	“I do [read them], sometimes it’s hurtful. Makes me mad. When it’s hurtful, I don’t feel like reading anymore,” he said.

	However, the prime minister said he does not block such users and he tries instead to “tell my side of the story on social media”.

Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak during the WIEF Foundation (unseen) at the 12th World Islamic Economic Forum before talking to the media in Jakarta, Indonesia, August 3, 2016. — Reuters picThe prime minister’s remarks come even as the government has come under attack over the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) controversy, where the state investment firm is under investigation in several countries.

	The US Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a civil lawsuit last month to seize more than US$1 billion in assets it said were purchased with money stolen from 1MDB.

	Najib also told the student dialogue that he usually sleeps at midnight, although he occasionally goes to bed at 1 or 2am during busy times like when he has to write a speech.

	The son of former prime minister Tun Abdul Razak also revealed that his father had sent him to boarding school overseas so that he would not get special treatment.

	“He wanted me to grow up in an environment where I would be judged based on my own skills. And I would be forced to compete with other kids without getting any special treatment,” said Najib.

	“He said that if I were to go to school here in Malaysia, people would treat me differently from others. So I would grow up in a different environment,” he added.

	The prime minister also said his father did not give him a large allowance.

	“In school back then, it was 20 sen, then 30 sen a day. So I never went to school with money, with a pocket full of money. No such thing. I wasn’t like that.

	“30 sen, 40 sen like that. He wanted to train me so that I would know the value of money,” said Najib.

Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said the implementation of the cancer control programme had already begun some time ago through the ministry’s introduction of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in 2010 to prevent cervical cancer. — AFP picJOHOR BARU, Aug 22 — The National Strategic Action Plan for Cancer Control Programmes (NSPCCP) which is in the final stage of fine-tuning, will only be implemented based on the Health Ministry’s capacity, including financial.

	Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said moreover, the ministry currently had no cancer therapy centres in the eastern and northern parts of the peninsula for the action plan to be implemented comprehensively.

	“However, if we look back, the process of implementing the plan had already begun some time ago through the ministry’s introduction of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in 2010 to prevent cervical cancer.

	“The programme is clearly helpful and perhaps within 10 years, we can see reduced cervical cancer cases in this country.”

	Dr Noor Hisham was speaking to reporters after the official opening of the Tunku Laksamana Johor CT Simulation Suite by Permaisuri Johor, Raja Zarith Sofiah Almarhum Sultan Idris Shah at Sultan Ismail Hospital, here, today.

	The NSPCCP 2016-2020, which replaced the previous plan, covers all aspects of cancer control including early detection, prevention and treatment.

	Dr Noor Hisham said the government was aware that such a plan was important as cancer was currently one of the causes of the highest number of deaths among Malaysians.

	Between 2007 and 2011, 100,569 cancer cases were diagnosed in Malaysia, with 18.1 per cent comprising breast cancer cases, 12.3 per cent (colon cancer) and 10.2 per cent (lung cancer).

File picture of ivory seized during a raid. KLIA custom officials found 111kg of ivory in packages heading to China and Thailand. — AFP picSEPANG, Aug 22 — When six packages arrived at the KL International Airport (KLIA) from Uganda this month and were declared as containing grains (cereals), customs officers suspected there might not be a grain of truth in the declaration.

	When the team of customs enforcement officers opened the packages which had arrived via Turkish Airlines, they were found to contain 111kg of ivory worth RM946,689, meant for China and Thailand markets to be processed into ornaments, idols and medicines.

	KLIA Customs director, Datuk Chik Omar Chik Lim said in that case on August 4, a group had flown the ivory from Entebbe, Uganda via Turkish Airlines, transit in Istanbul, Turkey before arriving in KLIA.

	“The packages were declared as grains (cereals) to be sent to a Salak Tinggi (Sepang) address.

	“Upon inspection, we found that the address did not exist and could not be reached.

	“No arrest was made and our investigations are underway to track down the smuggler of the seized ivory,” he told reporters at KLIA Customs Complex here today.

	He said this was one of seven cases involving the attempted smuggling of ivory tusks between January and yesterday, totalling almost RM10 million.

	During the period, the KLIA Customs also foiled two cases of attempted smuggling of Black Pond Tortoise worth about RM19,400.

	Chik Omar said the cases involving ivory and tortoise smuggling were investigated under Section 135 (1)(d) Customs Act 1967 for possession of prohibited goods without import licence.

	Meanwhile, the KLIA Customs director today handed over 1,174kg of ivory and semi-finished ivory products worth about RM10.19 million which were seized last year and this year, to the Wildlife and National Parks Department for further action. — Bernama




Hawaii will be among the destinations to be showcased at the Matta Fair, which takes place in September. — Reuters picKUALA LUMPUR, Aug 22 — A weaker ringgit against the greenback has not dampened Malaysians from visiting or studying in the United States, according to US embassy deputy chief of mission, Edgard Kagan.

	He noted that nearly 82,000 Malaysians visited the country in 2015, and the figure had grown more than 70 per cent over the past 10 years.

	“As more and more Malaysians discover the culture, landscape and hospitality of the United States, we’re confident that the number of Malaysian tourists to the United States will continue to grow,” he said.

This picture taken on October 5, 2013 shows a cobra at an enclosure at the city zoo in Yangon. Authorities found 181 snakes and other reptiles on the Bangkok-Padang Besar express train today. — AFP picPADANG BESAR, Aug 22 — Like a scene straight out of the Hollywood movie, Snakes on a Plane, the Perlis Royal Malaysian Customs Department found itself in a similar predicament.

	Except that the 181 serpents were found on board the Bangkok-Padang Besar express train this morning.   

	Other animals included two iguanas, 28 Dhab lizards, 10 tortoises, 10 squirrel gliders and 11 rabbits. The 248 exotic animals totalled about RM70,000.

	Initial investigations revealed that a syndicate attempted to smuggle the animals of various species in four bags when a team of customs enforcement officers unmasked the ‘ticketless commuters’.

	Department director Kamarudin Jaafar said the animals were meant for sale as pets as there was a high demand for them.

	He said about 9am, customs officers checked the passenger and cargo coaches, only to stumble on four suspicious-looking bags.

	“Two bags were found in the cargo coach and the rest in the toilet. When the bags were put through the scanning machine, movements believed to be made by live animals were detected,” he told a press conference here.

	Kamarudin said the 248 animals — confiscated under the Customs Act 1967 — were handed over to the Perlis Department of Wildlife and National Parks (Perhilitan) for further action.

	He added that the owner of the bags could not be detected.

	Meanwhile, Perlis Perhilitan director, Mohamad Affendi Ibrahim said all the animals were foreign species worth hundreds of ringgit each.

	He said the case would be investigated under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010 (Act 716). — Bernama

	Chief Minister Datuk Seri Idris Haron said all parties should cooperate with the authorities, especially the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) in investigations into corruption cases and in ensuring provision of services with integrity by the state government.

	“If it is true there are corrupt practices here, I would not allow such officers to be stationed in Malacca and they be replaced by officers that are clean.

	“The state government is serious about combating corruption as it wants an administration with integrity and good morals,” he told reporters after officiating at the Malacca state government’s monthly assembly organised by the state Road Transport Department (JPJ), in Ayer Keroh, here, today.

PBS acting president Datuk Seri Dr Maximus Johnity Ongkili said that the Malaysia Agreement 1963 will be studied for recommendations of action as the pledges in the agreement have ‘not been honoured satisfactorily’. — Picture by Yusof Mat Isa KUNDASANG, Aug 22 — Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS) said today it will set up two high-level committees to come up with recommendations for Borneonisation and the devolution of powers from Putrajaya to the state.

	PBS acting president Datuk Seri Dr Maximus Ongkili said that the Malaysia Agreement 1963 will be studied for recommendations of action as the pledges in the agreement have “not been honoured satisfactorily”.

	“We need to defend what is still there, and take back what have been eroded,” Ongkili told 200 participants after of a two-day party seminar on ‘Understanding the Malaysian Agreement 1963’ here today, according to a statement by the Barisan Nasional (BN) party.

	The Energy, Green Technology and Water Minister said he will be heading the main committee on the devolution of power, while PBS senior vice president Datuk Radin Malleh will chair the high level committee on Borneonisation.

	He said the two committees will be supported by technical teams comprising senior politicians and lawyers of the party who are experts in various fields, as well as former senior civil servants.

	They will be tasked to study and analyse the relevant issues, findings, and proposed solutions that will be presented to the party leadership, and subsequently to the state and federal governments.

	Ongkili, who was recently tasked to to carry out the duties as party president, said it was important to study the MA63 to understanding the safeguards, particularly Borneonisation to ensure Sabahans, especially natives, are well represented in the civil service, government-linked companies and other benefits.

	“We want to make sure both the federal and state civil services are not monopolised by one group only ,” he said, adding PBS had always been championing these issues to ensure the future generations are given fair treatment as contained in the Malaysia Agreement. 




Ideas Chief Executive Wan Saiful Wan Jan speaks to Malay Mail Online during an interview in Kuala Lumpur August 17, 2016. — Pictures by Yusof Mat IsaKUALA LUMPUR, Aug 22 — The climate of apprehension towards intellectual property (IP) rights in Malaysia among critics of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement betrays a lack of confidence in local innovators, the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs (Ideas) said.

	Speaking to Malay Mail Online at the sidelines of a recent closed door discussion on IP protection in Malaysia and the region, Ideas CEO Wan Saiful Wan Jan said that Malaysians should stop showing a lack of confidence in their own people.

	“The question for us is whether we want to encourage the copying industry or do we want to innovate,” said the head of the libertarian think tank.

	“I think this talk and fear about IP patents from abroad is a bit insulting to our own people. It’s as if our own people cannot innovate,” he added.

	Recently, critics of the TPP have claimed that the extended patent rights for generic medicine under the free trade treaty in the Pacific will cause prices of medicines to go up in Malaysia.

	But Wan Saiful said that such arguments are “misplaced”.

	“The TPP offers greater protection for patents for a longer period of time. That is all. It allows for more innovation to take place. There is no negative impact to this,” he added.

Deputy Director Intellectual Property Tilleke & Gibbins Alan Adcock speaks to Malay Mail Online during an interview in Kuala Lumpur August 17, 2016.Prominent regional IP lawyer Alan Adcock, who was one of the key speakers during Ideas’ forum with stakeholders Wednesday, said that encouraging innovation domestically or within the region could help reduce prices so that they’re more adaptable to local markets.

	“For this to happen, Asian governments have to figure out who their innovators are and what are the benefits they are looking for. For some, they consider money to be a good benefit. For some, it is not,” said Adcock, who is partner and deputy director for intellectual property at the Tilleke and Gibbins law firm in Bangkok.

	He also said arguments claiming that the price of medicines will immediately increase because of TPP and its IP provisions are “weak”.

	“Price of pharmaceutical products are very much market-based and there are a lot of factors contributing to the price,” he said.

	Earlier this year, Malaysia’s Health Ministry mooted the possibility of implementing plain packaging for tobacco products here, an idea that was previously criticised by Ideas.

	Wan Saiful said again that such a move might be a “slippery slope” that would affect other industries, as removing IP for one industry can erode confidence in other industries.

	Malaysia, which ratified the TPP earlier this year, is currently in the process of amending several legislations to accommodate all TPP provisions before the agreement comes into effect in February 2018.

Deputy IGP Datuk Noor Rashid Ibrahim said focus should be given to intelligence gathering to facilitate proactive measures to prevent intrusion of Sabah by foreign elements. ― Picture by Choo Choy May  KOTA KINABALU, Aug 22 — The Sabah contingent of the Royal Malaysian Police (PDRM) have been urged to step up efforts in gathering quality intelligence information to combat crime in the state, including kidnapping cases in the Eastern Sabah Security Zone (ESSZone).

	Deputy Inspector-General of Police, Tan Sri Noor Rashid Ibrahim said focus should be given to intelligence gathering to facilitate proactive measures to prevent intrusion of the state by foreign elements.

	“We have called all the district police chiefs in the ESSZone and explained to them the security measures that need to be taken in their respective areas.

	“We will also be focusing on best coordination together with the Eastern Sabah Security Command (ESSCom) and General Operations Force,” he said.

	Speaking to reporters after chairing a PDRM-ESSCom operations coordination meeting here today, Noor Rashid said the curfew order in the ESSZone would also continue.

	Asked about developments on the kidnapping of five crew members of a trawler boat in the waters of Dent Haven in Tambisan, Lahad Datu on July 18, he said police had received no further information and were still investigating the incident.

	Noor Rashid said the police operations procedure and work methods would also be reviewed and improved to prevent daylight kidnapping incidents.

	This followed the armed kidnapping of an Indonesian trawler boat skipper at Kertam, near Kuala Kinabatangan, Sandakan in broad daylight on Aug 3.

	Noor Rashid said the kidnapping incident was unplanned and not as claimed because the investigation revealed that the amount of ransom involved was believed to be small compared to the millions of ringgit demanded by kidnappers in the previous cases. — Bernama




KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 22 — The remand on three civil servants including a ‘Datuk Seri’ and ‘Datuk’ who were detained last Monday to assist in investigations into a corruption and money-laundering case has been extended.

	The remand on the Datuk Seri, aged 54, a senior officer with Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) was extended by the Putrajaya magistrate’s court for five days from tomorrow.

PKR vice president Chua Tian Chang said PKR leaders are in talks with Parti Pribumi over seat allocations. — Picture  by Yusof Mat IsaKUALA LUMPUR, Aug 23 — PKR is willing to give away some of the seats it previously contested to newly founded Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia, its vice president Chua Tian Chang said today.

	The Batu MP said Pribumi’s request to contest in PKR and PAS constituencies was “natural”, and that PKR would be open to rationalising seat allocations with the new party since the two are allies.

	“That is natural,” Chua, who is among the few PKR leaders actively in talks with the party founded by former prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, told Malay Mail Online.

	“When Keadilan was formed, of course we contested in PAS seats so similarly when they (Pribumi) are formed, we have to rationalise (the seat allocations) because that is the point of a co-operation,” he added.

	Pribumi could also provide new dynamics that would allow the opposition front to infiltrate areas otherwise unreachable by Pakatan Harapan, Chua said.

	“There is no point to hog the seats that we can’t win so if we have the strength, then we should work together to get more seats that are winnable for the opposition,” he said.

	On Saturday, Pribumi protem president and former deputy prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said his party is looking to contest in several PAS and PKR areas and would be looking to negotiate deals with both parties.

	The aim is for the new party to be a part of a coalition to remove Barisan Nasional (BN) from power and form a new government, he added.

	Most of the seats contested by PKR in past elections were urban and semi-urban areas with a highly mixed demographic, but the party also went for rural Malay-majority constituencies that PAS failed to win previously.

	PAS had since left the opposition bloc after it clashed with secular DAP over its push for hudud law in Kelantan.

	The division has triggered concerns that the opposition votes would be split should negotiations fail to prevent PAS from confronting Pakatan Harapan, which comprises PKR, DAP and Parti Amanah Negara, in the upcoming general election.

	But Muhyiddin said his party would be open to negotiations with PAS.

Malay Mail Online could not reach PAS leaders for comment.

	Speaking during a media briefing on Petronas’ latest financial results, Petronas CEO Datuk Seri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin said that the national oil and gas company had been engaging the Sarawak state government actively over the past two weeks.

	“We are very hopeful and confident this will be resolved soon,” he said, without elaborating.

	Following purported complaints made by some Sarawakian employees of Petronas on the company’s alleged discrimination against local workers, the Sarawak state government issued a moratorium on work permits for Petronas workers from Peninsula Malaysia.

	“There have been very extensive engagement over the past two weeks,” Wan Zulkiflee said.

	However, Wan Zulkiflee did not divulge details regarding any ongoing discussions and instead said that an announcement will be made publicly once a resolution is reached.




Diners queue outside the Mamak restaurant in Sydney, Australia. — Picture via Facebook/Mamak HaymarketKUALA LUMPUR, Aug 22 — Mamak, a Malaysian street food restaurant in Sydney, and its three directors have been fined A$292,672 (RM898,610) for underpaying its employees and using false records to disguise the payments, according to Business Insider Australia.

	Mamak, lauded as one of Sydney’s best value eatery, has long queues outside its Chinatown branch in the evenings, but the Australian Federal Court found that the workers are paying the price for the cheap meals.

	The case went to court after the Fair Work Ombudsman took legal action against the restaurant and its owners after discovering that six employees — five of whom are visa holders from non-English speaking backgrounds — were collectively underpaid more than A$87,000.

	The workers were only paid as little as A$11 an hour between February 2012 and April 2015. The national minimum wage for Australia is A$17.70 per hour, according to mywage.org, with exceptions for apprentices and junior employees (those under the age of 21).

	Australian judge Justin Smith found that Mamak conducted informal market research on pay rates on the black market and underpaid staff to maximise profit, and fined the business A$184,960.

	Rrestaurant owners Lee Joon Hoe, Julian Lee and Alan Au Wing-Keong were also fined A$36,992, A$35,360 and A$35,360 respectively.

	Judge Smith said, “Not only did the respondents know that the employees were being paid less than their legal entitlements, but they also knew that their records were not kept in accordance with the law,” adding that he wanted the severity of the penalties to act as a deterrent for other employers.

	“That approach, of course, was taken at the cost of the employees, who in reality, funded the success of the business,” he added, as quoted by Business Insider.

	The workers have been repaid the money they were owed.




Langkawi MP Datuk Nawawi Ahmad today apologised for causing confusion over ‘MO1’ remarks he made in a Facebook post. — Picture by Boo Su-LynKUALA LUMPUR, Aug 22 — Langkawi MP Datuk Nawawi Ahmad apologised today to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong for causing confusion over his “MO1” remarks on Facebook.

	The Umno lawmaker, who is under a police investigation over his remarks on social media about the King and “MO1”, also stressed that he did not intend to link the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to the issue and claimed his statement was twisted.

	“I’m making this apology out of my own awareness, responsibility and willingness without being influenced by any party,” Nawawi said in a statement.

	“DYMM Tuanku is pure and uninvolved in any political issues and His Majesty has nothing at all to do with the DOJ and 1MDB issues,” he added, referring to the US Department of Justice’s (DOJ) lawsuit that seeks to seize over US$1 billion (RM4 billion) in assets linked to Malaysian state investment firm 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).

	Nawawi had in a Facebook comment on Tuesday said that the Federal Constitution states that the government is made of three arms: the judiciary, executive, and legislature.

	He concluded that with all three bodies being answerable to the Agong, “the Agong is MO1”.

	Malay-language daily Berita Harian quoted Nawawi Thursday as insisting that he had not identified the Yang di-Pertuan Agong as the anonymous “Malaysian Official 1” figure mentioned in the DOJ’s lawsuit.

	He reportedly claimed that his controversial Facebook post only sought to interpret the Federal Constitution, and sought to distinguish between the “MO1” in his Facebook post and the US lawsuit which he said referred to two different things ― “Malaysia Official Number One” and “Malaysia Official One” respectively.

	In the DOJ civil lawsuit filed last month, “Malaysian Official 1” was identified as a high-ranking government officer with authority in 1MDB, but was not specifically named.

Car owners who flout the city’s laws will be charged RM50, which they will have to pay in person and within four hours of their vehicles being locked up or pay another RM100 to get them back after it is towed away. — File pic

	KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 22 — Upping the ante on traffic congestion in the national capital, City Hall (DBKL) will be clamping cars that are found to be parked illegally on the street from September 1.

	Car owners who flout the city’s laws will be charged RM50, which they will have to pay in person and within four hours of their vehicles being locked up or pay another RM100 to get them back after it is towed away, Mayor Datuk Seri Mhd Amin Nordin Abd Aziz said today.

	“This implementation is based on studies and scrutiny by DBKL’s Pemudah which found the irresponsible attitude of users who parked their cars illegally to be one of the main causes of traffic congestion,” he was quoted by national news agency Bernama as telling reporters after officiating at the Kuala Lumpur Low Carbon Society Blueprint 2030 Workshop here.

	Pemudah is DBKL’s special team tasked with helping businesses in the city.

	Areas that have been earmarked for enforcement are: Jalan Masjid India, Jalan Tun Sambanthan in Brickfield, Jalan Raja Muda Abdul Aziz, Jalan Bulan, Jalan Changkat Bukit Bintang, Jalan Chow Kit, Jalan Kenanga, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Solaris Mont Kiara and Jalan Klang Lama.

	According to the report, the new regulation is enforceable under the Road Transport Act 1987 and Road Transport Order (Provision on Car Parks) Federal Territories 2016.

	Mhd Amin said DBKL has issued a total of 746,185 in compound fines from January to July this year on vehicles found to have obstructed traffic.

	Of that figure, 232,726 was on cars that had no parking tickets; another 4,857 vehicles were towed away for parking offences.

	The KL mayor previously said DBKL has to take serious action as some 50,000 new cars are registered in Kuala Lumpur every month, clogging up the roads and causing gridlock in the city, especially within the central business districts and popular hangout spots like Bukit Bintang, Bukit Damansara, Sri Hartamas, Desa Hartamas, Solaris Mont Kiara, Taman Tun Dr Ismail and Bangsar.

	The latest action plan follows DBKL’s move last month to nearly triple the parking rates for public bays it owns, from RM0.80 per hour to RM2 for the first hour, and RM3 for every subsequent hour.

	Though many city motorists panned the move, DBKL’s parking rate action plan was welcomed by at least one group, the National Public Transport Users, who urged the government agency to take even more drastic action address public apathy towards the worsening congestion.

Travellers who have not undergone a yellow fever vaccination will be quarantined up to six days upon arrival. — Reuters picKUALA LUMPUR, Aug 22 — Three sporting officials in the Rio Olympic contingent from Penang have been quarantined as they did not receive yellow fever vaccination before leaving for Brazil.
	According to the New Straits Times (NST), Penang Health Department deputy director Dr Noorlia Yahaya confirmed the quarantine and said that the officials were immediately isolated upon their arrival in Malaysia.
	Dr Noorlia reportedly said she had no details about the latest status as the matter was being handled by the Crisis Preparedness and Response Centre (CPRC).
	She was quoted saying that CPRC would release updates on the situation on the Ministry of Health's website.
	The NST report also quoted National Sports Council deputy director-general Datuk Ab Jalil Abdullah as saying that the officials were sports juries, and that two of them were involved in weightlifting and ping pong.

Dawood’s attempt to flee from the Tuas Checkpoint was foiled after his car broke down.  — TODAY picSINGAPORE, Aug 22 — Hoping to turn a quick profit over the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, a man who tried to illegally import beef patties has been sentenced to nine months’ jail.

	Last June, the 48-year-old decided to import cakes, pastries and beef patties for Ramly burgers from across the Causeway.

	But when he was stopped at Tuas Checkpoint for an inspection, Mohamed Dawood R M Abdul Sukkur realised that the authorities would discover he had no licence for the beef patties, and proceeded to gun the engine and speed off.

	Dawood’s attempt to flee was foiled after his car broke down. He then tried to get rid of the evidence by dumping the beef patties in an open drain near the Pan-Island Expressway.

	Appearing in a district court today, Dawood admitted to importing a meat product without a licence, perverting the course of justice by disposing the beef patties, obstructing a Customs officer in the line of duty and speeding. He also consented to another four charges being taken into consideration during sentencing.

	District Judge Lee Poh Choo sentenced Dawood to nine months’ jail and an S$8,000 (RM23,886) fine. He was also banned from driving all vehicles for three years, following his release from prison.

	According to court documents, Dawood, who runs a car grooming and a food distribution company, had driven into Malaysia in a rented BMW around 7am on June 23 last year. After collecting the food items, he stored 105 packets of beef patties — weighing 37.8kg — under the spare tyre in the car boot. He was planning to supply the traditional cakes and pastries to shops in Singapore, and sell the beef patties to night market booths at Woodlands.

	About four hours later, he headed to Tuas Checkpoint to return to Singapore. After clearing immigration, he drove to a clearance area to declare his goods. An officer found that there were discrepancies on the permit submitted by Dawood, and asked her colleague to attend to him. Dawood was then told to drive to an inspection pit for further checks.

	But before turning into the pit, he realised that his lack of licence for the beef patties would be exposed. He saw that the vehicle barrier was raised and decided to make a run for it, the court heard.

	Around 12.30pm, his car broke down near Nanyang Technological University “as the engine had failed due to it being over-revved”.

	When the police eventually caught up with him, they found boxes of cakes and pastries on the grass patch beside the car. Dawood later led them to a drain near the expressway, where he had dumped the beef patties.

	“Singapore’s borders are the first line of defence against external threats, and any actions such as these at the border cannot be tolerated,” said Deputy Public Prosecutor Mansoor Amir.

	He added that Dawood had risked bringing in diseases from Malaysia through the illegal importation of beef.

	Dawood told the court that he was confused at the Tuas Checkpoint. “Normally, if they want to check me, they will hold my passport.... At that time, I cannot think because the passport was with me. I was really lost and panicked.”

	Defence lawyer Noor Mohamed Marican argued that his client had suffered a “momentary lapse of judgement” by panicking and driving away.

	The items, he added, were meant to help Dawood “make a small profit to help sustain his family”, which included 10 children.

The 92-year-old veteran public servant, who was closely associated with Singapore’s founding leader Lee Kuan Yew, was hospitalised on July 31 after suffering a cerebral stroke.
“The Prime Minister and his Cabinet colleagues are sad to learn of the passing of Mr S. R. Nathan and would like to convey their condolences to his family,” the statement said. 
Nathan was Singapore’s longest-serving president, a largely ceremonial post, and served as ambassador to Malaysia and the United States, two of the most prestigious jobs in the Singapore government service.
He also served as an intelligence chief in the military and held various positions in the private sector.
Nathan was elected to two six-year terms between 1999 and 2011.
Singapore’s president is the head of state but also has the power to protect the country’s reserves, veto senior government appointments, stop executions and review detention orders in internal-security cases. -- AFP


KOTA KINABALU: Police will work on gathering quality intelligence to curb security problems in Sabah’s east coast.
  Deputy Inspector-General of Police Datuk Seri Noor Rashid Ibrahim said this was among the measures discussed in today’s meeting with regards to enhancing the Eastern Sabah Security Command’s (Esscom) operational system.
  “I do not want to elaborate on the measures which will take place but what is important is that there is excellent coordination between Esscom and the General Operations Force team in Sabah, Sarawak and in the Peninsula.
  “At the same time, we remind all district police chiefs especially in the Eastern Sabah Safety Zone (Esszone) to take extra effort to gather intelligence. The Special Branch unit too must do their part in assessing all collected information.”
  Noor Rashid was speaking to reporters after chairing a meeting with Sabah police commissioner Datuk Abdul Rashid Harun and Esscom senior officers at the state police headquarters in Kepayan, here.
  The meeting focused on coordinating operations to be carried out by Esscom and police in the Esszone.
  Noor Rashid also gave his assurance that sea patrol operations would be planned accordingly, with emphasis placed on routes used by individuals to enter Sabah illegally.
  “The results from this operation will be analysed and used as guidance when conducting future operations,” he said, adding that the 7pm-5am curfew should remain. 

RIO DE JANEIRO:  A blustery storm, a touch of melancholy and a sense of pride converged at the closing ceremony of the 2016 Olympics on Sunday as Brazil breathed a collective sigh of relief at having pulled off South America’s first Games.
It was far from a perfect execution by Brazil, which battled with empty seats, security scares and a mysterious green diving pool. But two late gold medals for the host country in its two favorite sports, men’s soccer and volleyball, helped smooth some of the rough edges around the Games for Brazilians.
From the Maracana where it all began 16 days ago, the final event kicked off with figures dressed as multi-colored macaws flying over Rio’s world-famous landmarks, Christ the Redeemer and Sugarloaf Mountain, before forming the five Olympic rings.
A storm that menaced Rio all day sent wind and rain through Brazil’s most storied stadium and the power briefly went out in part of the stadium and the surrounding neighbourhood shortly before the ceremony kicked off.
Rain drenched performers and hundreds of athletes as they entered the party, many with medals hanging around their necks, like the US men’s basketball team which won gold on Sunday.
To the beat of traditional Brazilian music, Olympians danced and waved their countries’ flags to celebrate their place on the world’s premier sporting stage. The first Refugee team in Olympic history, one of the biggest crowd-pleasers of the Games, marched in behind the Olympic flag, carried by a Congolese judoka and Rio resident.
The athletes will witness the last of 306 medal ceremonies, for the men’s marathon earlier in the day.
The city will then hand over the Olympic flag to Tokyo, site of the 2020 Summer Games, and extinguish the Olympic flame, burning since Aug. 5, in a small, environmentally friendly cauldron.
SPORT COMPETES WITH SCANDAL
Rio will be remembered for the comeback of American swimmer Michael Phelps, who won five golds and one silver to reinforce his distinction as the most decorated Olympian of all time.
Jamaica’s Usain Bolt drew down the curtain on his brilliant Olympic career by securing a sweep of the sprint titles for a third successive Games. And American gymnast Simone Biles, the US flag bearer in the closing ceremony, kicked off her Olympic run by tying the record of four gold medals in a single Games.
At times, it was hard to focus on the great sporting moments happening across the sprawling city.
A low point for Rio came when Ryan Lochte, one of America’s most decorated swimmers, said he was robbed at gunpoint. That ignited further security concerns after a series of assaults against government ministers, athletes and tourists.
But Lochte’s story quickly unravelled when police discovered he fabricated his story to cover up his vandalizing a gas station after a drunken night out with three teammates. His lie enraged Brazilians and Americans alike.
Brazilians could take heart in the fact that there were no major mishaps or breaches after deadly attacks in Europe and the United States had prompted the biggest security operation in Brazil’s history. The military and police presence was extraordinary with 85,000 troops fanned out across venues, streets and transport hubs, double the deployment in London four years ago.
‘DIFFICULT MOMENT’
“Even with all our problems we pulled off a good Olympics. Nothing too bad happened and I’d say it was better than expected,” said Nivea Araujo, a Rio resident attending the closing ceremony.
For many in the soccer-mad nation, the best Olympic moments happened in the Maracana, where Brazil defeated Germany in soccer on Saturday and pieced together a widely hailed opening ceremony despite a tight budget.
“We are in a difficult moment as a country right now, we can’t hide that, but the Games were scheduled and I’m glad we could enjoy them,” said Alessandro Freitas, also from Rio.
One of the major concerns for Brazilians is what will be the final cost of the Games for a country in the midst of its deepest economic recession since the 1930s and how much they actually helped improve the city’s infrastructure.
And come Monday, with the Games no longer a distraction, Brazil gets back to its dour reality of duelling political and economic crises. An impeachment vote in coming days could lead to the permanent ouster of suspended President Dilma Rousseff.
Interim President Michel Temer, who was booed at the opening ceremony, decided not to attend the closing event. He said he would come for next month’s Paralympic Games. -- Reuters

TASEK GELUGOR: Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak today said he chooses to answer to the people and Umno to determine the fate of the country, instead of one particular individual.
Najib said there was no way he would allow one person to dictate the policies of the country.
"I choose to listen to the people and the three million Umno members to determine the best policies for them, and this is why I am being attacked.
"I will continue to fight no matter what (lawan tetap lawan). 
"I know I am not alone as I have the people behind me," he said in his speech when launching the Penang Barisan Nasional Merdeka month and officiating the Umno Tasek Gelugor division meeting here this afternoon.
Najib also took a swipe at Umno's detractors who set up a new party when there were problems in Umno, rather than coming together to resolve them.
"We may have our weaknesses... no nation is perfect. But we should work on improving these weaknesses," he said.
Meanwhile, Najib said the people should protect the country's dignity and sovereignty and not allow any form of foreign intervention.


KUALA LUMPUR: Police anti-narcotics officers busted an international drug syndicate when they nabbed six people, including three Taiwanese men, in Bukit Bintang on Friday.
  The 10pm operation saw 42.5 kilograms of methamphetamine worth RM3 million seized from the suspects.
  Federal police Narcotics Department (NCID) director Datuk Seri Mokhtar Shariff said the success was derived from close cooperation between the federal police and Taiwan's Bureau of Justice Investigation.
  He said police initiated an investigation into the syndicate after receiving intelligence shared by the Taiwanese authorities. 
  "After a thorough probe and surveillance, police officers from the NCID and Special Tactical Intelligence Narcotics Group  (Sting) launched a series of raids in Bukit Bintang and Petaling Jaya that started about 10pm on Friday.
  "First, we nabbed two men who were sitting in a Mercedes Benz at Jalan Bukit Bintang and seized a small amount of drugs from them.
  "Following the arrests, the police team was led to a hotel nearby where we raided four rooms and arrested three more men and a woman.
  "The raiding party found over 42kg of methamphetamine in one of the rooms," he told reporters during a press conference at the federal police headquarters, here, earlier today. 
  Mokhtar said initial investigations revealed that the drugs were smuggled into Malaysia from China.
  He said the drugs were meant for both local distribution and export to other countries.
  On another success, Mokhtar said NCID and Sting busted a drug syndicate in Selangor when they uncovered two drug labs in raids at seven locations in Klang, Shah Alam and Banting, Selangor. 
  He said police arrested 14 men aged between 17 and 40, and seized 13kg of heroin, 2kg heroin base, 200 grams of methamphetamine, 7.5kg methamphetamine in liquid form, and 129kg caffeine worth RM600,000, alongside drug processing tools.
  Both labs were located in Klang.
  Mokhtar said police investigation revealed that the drug syndicate was closely linked to a triad.
  Police also seized 13 cars, two lorries, a motorcycle, as well as RM30,430 in cash and jewelleries from the syndicate.
  All suspects from both cases are being remanded for five days to facilitate investigations under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, which carries the mandatory death penalty upon conviction.


RIO DE JANEIRO: Datuk Lee Chong Wei admitted that Chen Long was simply the better player on the day as the Malaysian won his third consecutive silver medal at the Rio Olympics on Saturday.
The World No 1 said he tried his best but couldn't find a way past Chen Long.
"Chen Long was in unbeatable form and was able to return all my shots. I also made mistakes at the net, which proved crucial," said Chong Wei, who was denied in the Olympic finals of 2008 and 2012 by Lin Dan.
"Credit to Chen Long but I tried my best and have to accept that my Olympic career will end with yet another silver medal."
Bronze medallist in the 2012 London Olympics, Chen Long won the final 21-18, 21-18 in 73 minutes.
There was to be no medal farewell for two-time champion Lin Dan as the China ace was denied the bronze by Denmark's Viktor Axelsen in the third-place playoff.
Axelsen won 15-21, 21-10, 21-17 in 70 minutes to give Denmark their first men's singles medal since current Badminton World Federation president Poul-Erik Hoyer Larsen won the gold in the 1996 Atlanta Games.


RIO DE JANEIRO: The silver was won but Goh V Shem blamed himself for the gold that was not, after he and partner Tan Wee Kiong were beaten in the Rio Olympics men's doubles final by China's Fu Haifeng-Zhang Nan on Friday.
The Malaysians twice held championship point - at 20-19 and 21-20 - only for the China pair to deny them at the death as World No 4 Haifeng-Zhang Na won 16-21, 21-11, 23-21 in 65 minutes at Pavilion 4, Riocentro.
"I wanted to keep it simple when we were holding championship point but instead, made mistakes. It is a wasted opportunity," said V Shem.
"It wasn't a case of nerves but more of a misjudgement which led to the mistakes."
Wee Kiong said it was a disappointing end to a superb campaign.
"We almost clinched the gold but were unlucky. It is disappointing but we have still done very well; to go home with the Olympic silver is something we didn't think was possible when we first started in Rio," said Wee Kiong.
Bronze was won by Britain's Marcus Ellis-Chris Langridge who beat China's Chai Biao-Hong Wei in the third-place playoff on Thursday.
The women's singles gold was won by Spain’s Carolina Marin, who beat P. V. Sindhu of India 19-21, 21-12, 21-15 in the final.
Bronze went to Japan's Nozomi Okuhara after China’s Li Xuerui conceded a walkover in the third-place playoff.


SEPANG: Olympic bronze medallist Azizulhasni Awang has downplayed the tense situation between him and Terengganu Menteri Besar Ahmad Razif Abdul Rahman after receiving a heroes' welcome at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) today.
Azizulhasni, whose third place finish in the keirin in Rio on Tuesday gave Malaysia its first ever Olympic medal in cycling, urged the public to shift their attention to his success instead of focusing on recent issues he had raised on the social media network.
After winning the medal, the Dungun-born rider had expressed his disappointment with Razif for a lack of support from his home state in a post on his Facebook page.
"I do not want to comment too much on the issue for the moment. He (Razif) could have overlooked the matter, give us a chance to discuss it," said the 28-year-old.
"I will have a sit down with him once I have had the chance to see my family, we have been in contact.
"I hope the public will focus on my achievement and not on these small issues.
"I am a (physically) small rider from a small country, I failed to win a medal at the 2008 (Beijing) and 2012 (London) games and suffered a bad injury when a splinter entered my leg in 2011.
"But I never gave up and managed to win a medal this time. I was the shortest guy on the podium and showed that not only can we compete with the best in the world but that  we can also beat them.
"I hope my story can be an inspiration to all and that we can all have that 'Malaysia Boleh' spirit."
He added that he hoped to see more basic velodromes being built across the country to allow for more participation in the sport at the grassroots level.
Azizulhasni said he was deeply touched by the reception at KLIA, and was looking forward to seeing his daughter Amna Khadeeja (11 months) and wife Athiah Ilyana Abd Samat.
"I am really touched by the welcome I have received here, from the water salute (for his plane), to all the fans and media that rushed to greet me once I came out that door.  I am just lost for words.
"However, I have been thinking a lot about seeing Khadeeja and Athiah, who couldn't be here today. I hope everyone can pray that Khadeeja will make a quick recovery."
Athiah was unable to greet Azizulhasni today as she is taking care of Khadeeja, who has been hospitalised due to fever. 


KUALA LUMPUR: Former Sime Bank chief executive officer Datuk Ismail Zakaria was today fined RM600,000 in default 40 months jail by the High Court on four charges of acting beyond his authority to approve credit facilities totaling some RM175 millions to an investment firm.
Judicial Commissioner Datuk Abd Karim Abd Rahman, in allowing the prosecution appeal's against Ismail's 2011 acquittal at the Sessions court, said the presiding judge in that case had seriously erred in her findings.
Bank Negara Malaysia has appealed against the acquittal through the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) and today's conviction brings an end to one of Malaysia's longest running cases.
"She believed the prosecution during the prosecution's case but did not believe them at the defence case. Instead she chose believe in the testimony of the respondent which had no basis."
He said the respondent is this case also had departed from the mandate given by the Sime Bank board of directors who wanted the loans to be given out to settle the outstanding debts but the person applying for the loan, Datuk Low Thiam Hock, had used to money to buy more shares which he used as collateral against the outstanding debts.
But the 1997 Asian financial crisis had wiped out the value of the shares which resulted in Sime Bank suffering heavy losses.
Low is also known in the business circle as Repco Low.
Ismail, 74, who is now wheelchair-bound after suffering a stroke, was charged with approving RM59 million, RM50 million, RM40 million and RM26 million to Everise Capital Sdn Bhd. at his office, 2nd Floor, Sime Bank Building in Jalan Sultan Ismail near here between Sept 20 and Oct 21, 1997.
He was fined RM150,000 in default ten months jail, for each offence.
Ismail was charged under Section 65(1) of the Banking and Financial Institutions Act (Bafia) 1989, and punishable under Section 103(1)(a) of the same Act, provide for jail terms of up to five years or a maximum fine of RM5 million, or both, for each charge.
The prosecution was led by Abdul Rashid Daud who is head of commercial and cyber crime at AGC while Kitson Foong represented Ismail.

"We took the suspect to the same location today where we recovered the body in a ravine near the river.
"We are still investigating the case and are awaiting a forensic report," said Abdul Hamid who declined to comment further on the case.
The remains of Noor Amila was taken to the Kuala Lumpur Hospital Forensic Unit for post-mortem. At press time, family members were present at the hospital.

​RIO DE JANEIRO: Shuttlers Chan Peng Soon-Goh Liu Ying made no excuses after settling for the Rio Olympics mixed doubles silver on Wednesday.
They lost, the Malaysians said, to opponents who were simply way better than them and there was nothing they could do to stop Indonesia's Tontowi Ahmad-Liliyana Natsir at Pavilion 4, Riocentro.
The World No 3 Indonesians won 21-14, 21-12 in 42 minutes to win gold, four years after suffering the heartbreak of finishing fourth in the London Olympics.
"There was nothing that we could do as the Indonesians were in top form. Their determination to win was so great," said Liu Ying.
Peng Soon agreed.
"We had a game plan but the Indonesians had theirs too and obviously, they were superior to us. 
"However, we are both happy to win the silver considering that we were glad to have just made the semi-finals," said Peng Soon.
There was no shame in defeat as the World No 11 played above expectations to make the final after failing to progress beyond the group stage in London four years ago.
China’s Zhang Nan-Zhao Yunlei, the 2012 Olympic champions, had beaten compatriots Xu Chen-Ma Jin on Tuesday in the bronze medal playoff. ​


KUALA LUMPUR: MT Vier Harmoni was not hijacked. Instead, its crew sailed it to Batam, Indonesia following a dispute with their employer.
  Clarifying the matter this evening, Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) chief Datuk Ahmad Puzi Abdul Kahar said preliminary investigations suggest that the drama rose following a disagreement between their crew and their employer, the ship’s owner.
  This, he said, led to the crew taking matters into their own hands.
  "MMEA and our Indonesian counterparts worked together in tracking the ship. We were later informed that the ship was safe in Batam. 
  “Initial investigations suggest that the crew members decided to sail the ship to Batam after a dispute between them and their employer," he said, adding that most of the crew are Indonesian.
  Ahmad Puzi said MMEA have yet to obtain the full picture on the issue, but are conducting investigations. MMEA had earlier deployed its assets to search for the ship following fears that it had been hijacked.
  Earlier today, MMEA had announced that the ship was feared to have been hijacked off the Kuantan coast. The vessel was en route to Kemaman, Terengganu when it deviated from its course.
  The vessel was carrying 900,000 litres of diesel worth RM1.57 million.

RIO DE JANEIRO: Azizulhasni Awang dedicated his Rio Olympics bronze medal to all Malaysians after surviving a nerve-wracking keirin final at the Olympic Velodrome on Tuesday.
Although Azizulhasni was targeted to deliver gold, it was an awesome effort to win bronze as the final had to be restarted twice and there was intense pressure on the Malaysian.
The first stop was to review Azizulhasni and Britain's Jason Kenny for a technical infringement, which ultimately was ruled against.
The race was restarted, only to be stopped again as the officials reviewed another supposed infringement.
It was again ruled against and the race was finally allowed to proceed.
It was a tough race as Azizulhasni, despite leading from the front, was boxed in and had to fight his way to the front.
"I thought I had won the silver but when it was shown that I won bronze, I wasn't disappointed.
"I gave it my best and I dedicate the bronze to all Malaysians. They have supported me since I was young and I hope I have repaid their faith in me," said Azizulhasni.
"What I want to do now is return to Malaysia and spend some time with my family.
"It has been a tiring experience but one that has been worth it."
Gold was won by Britain's Kenny with silver going to Matthijs Buchli of the Netherlands.

KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian Crime Watch Task Force (MyWatch) chairman Datuk R. Sri Sanjeevan today claimed trial at the magistrate's court to an extortion charge.
Sanjeevan, 31, is alleged to have put one Mohamad Azhan Hamza, 32, in fear of injury in order to commit extortion at Restoran Marakesh, Jalan Raja Uda in Kampung Baru, near here, at about 9pm on May 22, 2014.
This is the third extortion charge leveled against Sanjeevan. He also has another charge of hiring an illegal immigrant.
Deputy public prosecutor Noor Elynna Hanim Abd Halim did not offer Sanjeevan bail.
Counsel Ravin Jay told the court his client's offence is not a life and death matter.
"This is not a serious offence that carries life imprisonment. In fact, bail has been offered in other courts where he has been charged with other similar offences and had posted up to RM21,000 in bail for the previous charges.
"He also has been brought up and down in the country to face all these charges."
Ravin requested the court to impose a RM1,000 bail on Sanjeevan.
Magistrate Ahmad Solihan Wahid set bail at RM2,500 in one surety and fixed Sept 8 for case mention.
Sanjeevan's wife posted bail.


RIO DE JANEIRO: Malaysia’s Goh V Shem-Tan Wee Kiong played one of their best matches ever as they toppled World No 1 Lee Yong Dae-Yoo Yeon Seong to make the Rio Olympics men’s doubles semi-finals on Monday.
The Malaysians, who had only beaten the Koreans once in six previous meetings, went one better by winning 17-21, 21-18, 21-19 in 86 minutes.
It was a wonderful victory, especially as the Koreans had narrowed the gap to 19-20 after trailing 13-18 in the decider. 
It was a close affair from the start as both pairs gave it their best.
Yong Dae-Yeon Seong, however, were coming off better in the exchanges and took the first game 21-17.
The second game was another cagey affair until V Shem-Wee Kiong took a 19-15 lead.
The Koreans, however, took three points in a row to cause some nervousness in the Malaysian camp but V Shem-Wee Kiong steadied themselves to force the decider.
Buoyed by their performance in the second game, the Malaysians adopted a more aggressive approach in the decider and were rewarded as the Koreans began to make mistakes.
The Malaysian fans began to dream of the semi-finals when V-Shem-Wee Kiong led 18-13 only for the Koreans to claw back to 19-20.
The Malaysians, however, were not to be denied as they sealed their semi-final berth.  ​


PUTRAJAYA: Three civil servants including a ‘Datuk’ and a ‘Datuk Seri’ were arrested by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) today for corruption, abuse of power and money-laundering.
  The authorities also froze RM13 million in their bank accounts, including savings accounts and unit trusts amounting between RM1 million and RM6 million.
  Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) investigations division director Datuk Azam Baki said the operation was launched simultaneously in Kuala Lumpur, Malacca and Kelantan.
  “The trio, in their 50s, were arrested between 12pm and 2pm. They were attached to a government department, a local authority and a government-linked company. 
  “MACC officers also seized several condominiums including penthouse, a bungalow and luxury cars such as Maserati, BMW and Audi; believed to have been obtained from proceeds of corruption and money-laundering.” he said in a statement today.
  MACC also found about RM400,000 in cash, foreign currency and several luxury wristwatches.
  The move comes hot on the heels of MACC Chief Commissioner Datuk Dzulkifli Ahmad’s pledge to wipe out corruption and abuse of power by civil servants.
  The case is being investigated under Section 17(a) and 23 of the MACC Act 2009 and Section 4(1) of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001. Under the MACC Act 2009, those convicted can be sentenced to 20 years in prison; fined RM10,000 or five times the bribe, whichever is higher.
  For an offence under the Anti-Money Laundering Act, offenders are liable to imprisonment not exceeding 15 years and a fine of not less than five times the sum or value of the proceeds of the unlawful activity, or RM5 million, whichever is higher.
  Azam said the investigations are still ongoing. Those arrested are expected to be remanded tomorrow.


PUTRAJAYA: Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi today launched the National Action Plan on Anti-Trafficking in Persons 2016 - 2020, in an effort to improve its ranking on US State Department’s Trafficking in Persons Report (USTIP).  
Zahid, who is also the Home Minister, vowed to upgrade Malaysia's ranking to Tier 1 by 2020, after chairing a High Level Committee meeting on anti-human trafficking comprising various ministries.
Malaysia remained in the Tier 2 watchlist after moving up from the Tier 3 blacklist in 2015.
Also present at the launch were Defence Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein, Transport Minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai, Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S. Subramaniam and Human Resources Minister Datuk Seri Richard Riot Jaem.
"Malaysia has been working hard to check human trafficking activities.
"But there is an international syndicate that are smuggling people into the country," he said at the launch.
He added enforcement agencies, including police and Immigration Department, had increased effort to curb the illegal activities with all their means and resources.
Zahid also stressed that Malaysia should not be held accountable over issues at hand and added that the source countries must also be held responsible.
The 2016-2020 action plan outlines the transformation by the government following the amendment to Atipsom 2007 last year in strengthening victim protection, which allowed free movement, employment, salary entitlement and the expansion of NGOs' role. 
The plan is a continuation from the earlier five-year action plan that was launched on March 30, 2010.

RIO DE JANEIRO: Chan Peng Soon-Goh Yiu Ling are within touching distance of a Rio Olympics medal after advancing to the semi-finals at Pavilion 4, Riocentro on Sunday.
The Malaysian mixed pair beat Poland's Robert Mateusiak-Zieba Nadiezda 21-17, 21-10 in the quarter-finals.
A win will see the Malaysians playing either China's Chen Yu-Ma Jin or South Korea's Ko Sung Hyun-Kim Ha Na in the semi-finals. 
 ​The China-South Korea match was scheduled for later on Sunday.
Seeking to make the semi-finals on Monday will be men's doubles Goh V Shem-Tan Wee Kiong and women's pair Vivian Hoo Kah Mun-Woon Khe Wei.
Sunday's knockout stage draw saw V Shem-Wee Kioong paired with South Korea's top seeds Lee Yong Dae-Yoo Yeon Seong in the last eight.
V Shem-Wee Kiong drew the Koreans as Yong Dae-Yeon Seong finished second in their group. The Koreans lead 5-1 in their previous encounters with the Malaysians.
A win will see V Shem-Wee Kiong  facing either China's Chai Biao-Hong Wei or Russia's Vladimir Ivanov-Ivan Sozonov in the semi-finals.
Vivian-Khe Wei, who finished second in their group, will face Japanese top seeds Misaki Matsutomo-Ayaka Takahashi in their quarter-final. The Malaysians have never won any of their previous seven meetings against the World No 1 pair.
​
The winners will take on either South Korea's Jung Kyung Eun-Shin Seung Chan or Eefje Muskens-Selena Peik of the Netherlands.


RIO DE JANEIRO: The real challenge begins for Lee Chong Wei after he easily advanced into the Rio Olympics men's singles quarter-finals on Sunday.
Singapore's Derek Wong was beaten 21-18, 21-8 in 35 minutes as Chong Wei, as expected, topped Group A to advance into the quarter-finals. The Malaysian received a bye in the last-16 stage.
Up next for the World No 1 will be either Taiwan's Chou Tien Chen or Hong Kong's Hu Yun on Wednesday.
"It is good to have finished the group stage without any problems and I can now focus on the knockout stage.
"I felt good on court even though my opponent didn't offer too many challenges," said Chong Wei at Pavilion 4, Riocentro.
Chong Wei said he has adapted well to the conditions and having extended breaks between his matches wasn't too much of a problem.
"I would prefer to play daily and finish the tournament but I just have to keep my focus."
Chong Wei beat Soren Opti of Suriname on Thursday in his opening clash before playing Singapore's Wong on Sunday.
It will be another two-day break before his quarter-final.
"I just have to cope with it. It's the Olympics and I want the gold so I have to accept all challenges," said Chong Wei.​


KUALA LUMPUR: The government will offer a no-deposit scheme to make it easier for People's Housing Project (PPR) dwellers here to own their homes, while children living in these projects will get free transport to schools.
Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said these measures were part of efforts to alleviate burden of the lower-income group caused by the rising cost of living.
He said the government would  offer a no-deposit hire-purchase scheme to qualified PPR residents in Kuala Lumpur.
"Housing is one of the issues faced by the urban poor. Other issues include vandalism in flats, leading to faulty lifts, as well as poor sewage system," Zahid said when opening the Lembah Pantai Umno division meeting here today.
"The government is continuously looking for solutions to these issues. Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak has given his assurance that we not only look at rural areas but also problems faced by the urban poor." 
Zahid, who is Umno vice-president,  said free bus rides to school would be provided to children of PPR flat dwellers.
In an immediate response, Federal Territories Minister Datuk Seri Tengku Adnan Tengku Mansor, who is Umno secretary-general, said he would meet with Kuala Lumpur City Hall to discuss and iron out the details.


RIO DE JANEIRO: Wendy Ng Yan Yee did Malaysia proud at the Maria Lenk Aquatic Centre on Saturday when she qualified for Sunday's 3m springboard final.
Wendy, 23, finished joint-fifth in the semi-final to book her place a day after just advancing from the qualifying round in 17th place.
It was a commendable achievement as Wendy had failed to make the final in the 2012 London Olympics, finishing 24th in the preliminary round.
"I am so happy to have made the final and I will give it my best shot," said Wendy, who scored a total 324.75 points from her five dives.
China's Shi Tingmao scored a phenomenal 385 points to lead the 12 qualifiers for the final. Second was her compatriot He Zi (364.05) while Canada's Jennifer Abel (343.45) was third.
Australia's Maddison Keeney scored 326.35 for fourth while Wendy shared fifth place with American Abigail Johnston.
"I felt more comfortable today (Saturday) compared to Friday. I was more relaxed and this helped me execute my dives better," said Wendy.
While Wendy had a day to remember, national golfer Danny Chia had one to forget as he endured a torrid third round at the Olympic Golf Course.
Danny scored a five-over 76 for a 219 total to drop to joint-51st in the 60-player field.
Gavin Kyle Green enjoyed a better round but his one-over 72 saw him placed alongside Danny and both golfers will be desperate to use Sunday's final round to scramble up the leaderboard.
Sailors Khairulnizam Afendy and Nur Shazrin Latif finished 28th and 33rd respectively in the men's laser and women's laser radial, with both failing to make their medal races.
Besides Wendy attempting to win Malaysia's second diving medal after Pandelela Rinong-Cheong Jun Hoong clinched the 10m platform synchronised silver on Tuesday, national shuttler Lee Chong Wei will also be in action on Sunday.
The World No 1 meets Singapore's Derek Wong in a Group A clash (7.55pm Malaysian time). 
Chong Wei has never been beaten by Derek and the Malaysian, seeking the men's singles gold in Rio after taking silver in the last two Olympics, looks primed to continue his winning run over the Singaporean.
Women's singles Tee Jing Yi is the other Malaysian shuttler in action on Sunday where she faces Japan's two-time world junior champion Akane Yamaguchi (7.30pm, Malaysian time) in a Group K tie.
High jumper Nauraj Singh, aiming to qualify for the final, will be in qualifying action at the Olympic Stadium (Monday 3.30am Malaysian time) while cyclist Fatehah Mustapa will compete in the women's sprint qualifying (Monday, 3am Malaysian time) at the Olympic Velodrome.


RIO DE JANEIRO: Shuttlers Goh V Shem-Tan Wee Kiong turned on the style to score an upset 16-21, 21-15, 21-18 win over China’s World No 4 Fu Haifeng-Zhang Nan in a Rio Olympics Group B tie at Pavilion 4, Riocentro on Saturday.
It was an important victory in the World No 12 Malaysians' bid to win an Olympic medal as it assured them of relatively easier quarter-final opponents.
“After a poor start, we seized control and played a more attacking game. Beating the China pair is a confidence booster and we are looking forward to the knockout stage," said V Shem. 
The Malaysians will know after Sunday’s draw who they will face in the quarter-finals but it will be a pair who finished runners-up in one of the other groups.
​A tougher quarter-final draw is what mixed pair Chan Peng Soon-Goh Yiu Ling face as they went down 21-19, 21-19 to Indonesia’s Tontowi Ahmad-Liliyana Natsir to finish second in Group C.
Meanwhile, Lee Chong Wei will be in action against Singapore’s Derek Wong on Sunday as the World No 1 continues his bid to win Olympic gold for the first time. 


BATU GAJAH: The Defence Ministry has banned Pokemon Go at its headquarters and other sensitive areas and assets under the armed forces. 
Its minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein said he has directed the armed forces "risik" (intelligence) unit to ensure that the virtual game is not played at the Mindef headquarters.
At the same time, he said the head of the army, navy and air force would decide which areas and assets under their jurisdictions would be a "no go" for the augmented reality smartphone game.
He was commenting  on the warning issued by Army chief Tan Sri Raja Mohamed Affandi Raja Mohamed Noor to his personnel against playing  Pokemon Go, especially at army camps.
Yesterday, Affandi was quoted as saying that Pokemon Go was a threat to the safety of its players and national security when played by army personnel.
Hishammuddin said, unlike other handphone apps such as Google Maps and Waze, Pokemon Go might pose a threat to security aspect as it would also record videos and take pictures and the information of a player's surroundings.
He was speaking to reporters after opening the Batu Gajah Umno delegates' meeting here today. 


RIO DE JANEIRO: Unheralded Singaporean Joseph Schooling stunned the great Michael Phelps in his final individual Olympic race in an almighty upset at the Rio Games on Friday.
Phelps was seeking his 23rd Olympic gold in the 100m butterfly but Schooling, 21, relegated the legendary American to silver – which he shared with both Chad le Clos and Laszlo Cseh.
It was by far the biggest shock on a day of surprises, as 1,500m ace Sun Yang flopped out of his pet event and defending champions USA crashed out of the women’s football.
Ethiopia’s Almaz Ayana smashed the long-standing women’s 10,000m record by nearly 14 seconds as the athletics competition got underway without Russia, whose track and field team are suspended over a doping scandal.
Elsewhere cyclist Bradley Wiggins became his country’s most decorated Olympian of all time and Rafael Nadal, returning from a wrist injury, won men’s doubles gold.
The Rio Games also reeled from three doping cases as a Chinese swimmer was suspended and a Bulgarian weightlifter and Polish runner were kicked out.
Victory in Friday’s fly would have given Phelps a 14th individual Olympic title, but Schooling proved too strong.
Schooling, who took bronze at last year’s world championships, punched the water and roared with delight as Phelps swam over to pat him on the back before le Clos ruffled the youngster’s hair.
Katie Ledecky also made history as she completed the first 200m, 400m and 800m treble since 1968 – and in world-record time.
America’s latest swimming star won the 800m by a distance in a time of 8min 04.79sec, beating her own world record of 8:06.68 set in January.
On the track, Ethiopia’s Ayana set tongues wagging when she obliterated a record set in 1993 by timing 29min 17.45sec, 15 seconds ahead of Kenya’s Vivian Cheruiyot in second.
Athletics is battling a torrent of doping controversies after world body the IAAF suspended Russia’s track and field team and Kenya was threatened with the same treatment.
Ayana’s record was greeted with suspicion by marathon world record-holder Paula Radcliffe, but the 24-year-old brushed off the speculation.
“My doping is my training, my doping is Jesus – otherwise I’m crystal clear,” she smiled.
Michelle Carter of the United States stunned defending champion Valerie Adams with her very last throw to win the gold medal in the women’s shot put final.
Britain’s Jessica Ennis-Hill made a strong start to her heptathlon title defence as she won the 100m hurdles, finished third in the high jump and second in the shot put to lie second overall.
French giant Teddy Riner, who stands 6ft 8in (2.04 metre) and weighs more than 300 pounds, won the men’s +100kg judo by penalties from Japan’s Hisayoshi Harasawa.
Earlier, Egyptian judoka Islam El Shehaby was jeered after refusing to shake hands with his Israeli opponent at the end of their heavyweight first round encounter.
Chen Xinyi, 18, a rising star in the Chinese swimming team, was suspended after she tested positive for a banned diuretic following Sunday’s women’s 100m butterfly, where she placed fourth.
The world sports tribunal had earlier expelled European champion weightlifter Tomasz Zielinksi and Bulgarian 3,000m steeplechase runner Silvia Danekova over doping as the Games registered its first major cases.
Chinese swimmer Sun’s unhappy Olympics also came to a halt when he finished seventh in his heat and 16th overall in qualifying for the 1,500m, an event in which he has been untouchable.
In football, American goalkeeper Hope Solo lashed out at Sweden as “cowards” as the 2004, 2008 and 2012 women’s football gold medallists and reigning world champions went out 4-3 on penalties.
“We played a bunch of cowards,” Solo told Sports Illustrated.
“The better team did not win today. I strongly believe that. I think you saw American heart. You saw us give everything we had today.”

HUA HIN: A string of bomb attacks targeting Thailand’s crucial tourism industry have killed four people, authorities said Friday, sending authorities scrambling to identify a motive and find the perpetrators.
Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha called for calm and said he did not know who was behind the attacks, while analysts tentatively pointed the finger at Muslim insurgent groups in the south who have for years been fighting the Thai state.
Twin bombs exploded in the upscale resort of Hua Hin late Thursday, killing one woman and wounding more than 20 others, including nine foreign tourists, and were followed by two more on Friday morning that killed another person.
AFP journalists saw injured and bleeding people lying on the pavements shortly after the latest explosions, as emergency workers rushed to the scene and took them away in ambulances.
A further two blasts struck Friday at Patong Beach on the popular tourist island of Phuket, while two more bombs were reported in the southern towns of Trang and Surat Thani, in each of which one person was killed.
“The bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion,” Prayut told reporters. “We should not make people panic more.”
“Why have the bombs occurred as our country is heading towards stability, a better economy and tourism – and who did it? You have to find out,” he added.
The two bombs that went off in Hua Hin on Thursday were hidden in potted plants and went off within 30 minutes of each other in the bar district of the popular beach town.
While small bombings are common in the kingdom during periods of heightened political tension, there have been few such incidents in the past year and it is rare for tourists to be targeted.
Britain and Australia reacted by advising their nationals to avoid public places.
Hua Hin is home to the Klai Kangwon (Far From Worries) summer palace of Thailand’s revered royal family, and the firsts blasts came on the eve of Queen Sirikit’s 84th birthday and just ahead of the first anniversary of a Bangkok shrine bombing that killed 20.
Hua Hin’s district chief, Sutthipong Klai-udom, told AFP that the first bombs were detonated by mobile phone. Staff at local hospitals said German, Italian, Dutch and Austrian nationals were among the wounded.
“It was very shocking. There was a loud noise and police were running everywhere, it was terrible,” said Michael Edwards, an Australian tourist staying in a guest house close to where the second bomb detonated.
“I was just surprised that it happened here... now I’m thinking if it’s worth staying,” he told AFP.
Hua Hin is an upscale resort town about 200 kilometres (125 miles) south of Bangkok, popular with both local and foreign tourists.
The palace there has for years been favoured by King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world’s longest reigning monarch.
The 88-year-old is currently hospitalised in Bangkok for a number of health issues, a source of anxiety for many Thais and a key factor in the kingdom’s past decade of political turmoil.
Paul Chambers, an expert on the Thai military, said rebels from the south were prime suspects in the blasts.
“The culprits are most likely Malay-Muslim insurgent groups fighting the Thai state in the deep south,” he said.
“The attack on Hua Hin seems like a direct affront at the Kingdom of Thailand. Hua Hin is home to a royal palace... also, the bombing comes on the queen’s birthday.”
Zachary Abuza, an expert on Southeast Asian militant groups, said that although the southern insurgents had not carried out coordinated attacks for years, “it’s not that they haven’t or couldn’t, it’s just been a while.”
“Whoever has perpetrated these wants to do serious damage to the Thai economy. That is where the junta is the most vulnerable.”
Thailand’s military rulers, who seized power in 2014 after a decade of at times violent political unrest, have touted an increase in stability in the kingdom as a major accomplishment of its rule.
The junta on Sunday saw its new version of the constitution approved in a referendum, although the three insurgency-hit provinces rejected the controversial statute.
Thailand’s reputation as the “Land of Smiles” has suffered in recent years from political unrest and a number of high-profile crimes against foreigners.
But tourists continue to flock to its white, sandy beaches and Buddhist temples.
The kingdom is expecting a record 32 million visitors in 2016, with the tourism industry a bright spot in an otherwise lacklustre economy.
The latest blasts came just days before the first anniversary of the last major attack on tourists in Thailand – an August 17 bomb that killed 20 people, mostly ethnic Chinese tourists.
That blast ripped through a crowded Hindu shrine in the heart of Bangkok and stunned the kingdom as the deadliest assault in recent history. 
Two Uighur men from western China have been accused of the attack and are due to go on trial later this month. Both have denied any involvement.--AFP


Big haul: Comm Mohd Mokhtar (left) discussing the items seized during the raid at the press conference in Bukit Aman.

KUALA LUMPUR: Drugs worth RM3.6mil were seized and 20 people nabbed after a series of actions by police over the weekend.
Those arrested included 14 triad members and two Taiwanese men.
In the first case, Bukit Aman and Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice Inves­tigation Bureau busted an international syndicate and confiscated RM3mil worth of drugs, believed to be syabu, after detaining six suspects, including a woman and two Taiwanese men.
Investigations revealed the drugs were smuggled into the country from China and stuffed into items like radiators.
“They would often declare the goods as machinery items to avoid detection,” said Narcotics Crime Inves­tigation Department director Comm Datuk Seri Mohd Mokhtar Mohd Shariff, adding that police believed that some of the drugs were exported to Indonesia.
Among other items seized were a Mercedes-Benz, foreign currencies and jewellery, he told a press conference yesterday.
Comm Mohd Mokhtar said that those nabbed, aged between 24 and 52, were picked up in Bukit Bintang here between Friday night and Saturday morning.
“The first two suspects were arrested in a car. There were drugs hidden in the vehicle’s armrest.
“That led us to a nearby hotel where we arrested four more people and discovered 42kg of substance,” he said.
In the second case, two drug laboratories were uncovered with police seizing various drugs worth RM600,000. They also arrested 14 triad members, including a teenager. 
Comm Mohd Mokhtar said the suspects, aged between 17 and 40, were detained at seven separate locations in Shah Alam, Klang and Banting on Saturday.
The drub laboratories were discovered in Klang.
“Among others, we also confisca­ted jewellery and 13 vehicles inclu­ding a Mercedes-Benz, BMW and a Toyota Vellfire, worth about RM1mil in total,” he said.
Between Jan 1 and Aug 18, police arrested 128,008 people for drug-related offences and seized 76 various types of firearms and hand grenades.


Straight from the heart: Team Zephyrus (from left) Lee Ann, Faun, Lee and Mellody receiving the Outstanding Award plaque from Goh, Lim and Chia.

KUALA LUMPUR: The phrase “We are all children of Malaysia” in Chong Hwa Independent High School’s song is sung with much gusto at school every week.
This very line – penned by the school’s first principal in 1919 – is a constant reminder to the students to be responsible citizens.
And fittingly, it underlined the work that won the school’s team an award for promoting unity.
Students Isabelle Lee, Lee Ann, Faun Zhi Yi and Mellody Nizam recently clinched the Outstanding Award for Wilayah Persekutuan in a contest organised by The Star’s Newspaper-in-Education (NiE).
The contest Game4Life required students, in teams of four, to submit a poster on the theme: sports as a vehicle for social change.
Chong Hwa is one of nine schools to receive this top state-level award. The other eight are: SJK(C) Chung Hua Seremban, Negri Sembilan; SMK Damansara Utama, Selangor; SMK Dato Ahmad Maher, Kelantan; SMK Infant Jesus Convent, Malacca; SMK Kuching High, Sarawak; SMK Muhibbah, Sabah; SMK Permas Jaya, Johor and SMK Tarcisian Convent, Perak.
Star Media Group editor-in-chief Datuk Leanne Goh presented the award to the Chong Hwa team last week. Also at the ceremony were the school’s board of directors chairman and Ekovest Berhad managing director Datuk Seri Lim Keng Cheng and principal Chia Song Choy.
Lim said the contest “gives the students exposure and helps them gauge where they stand with other schools”.
He commended The Star for coming up with an apt contest theme that coincided with the Olympics.
“It has always been the school’s belief that one should put country before self. Chong Hwa has lasted for almost a decade because of its excellent culture and practices,” he said.
Lim, however, lamented that the UEC (Unified Examination Certificate) is not recognised by Malaysian public universities.
“Malaysia is losing talent from Chinese independent schools because other countries recognise the examination,” he said.
Although its students sit for two major examinations, SPM and UEC, Chia said the school emphasises holistic education.
“We focus on balancing curriculum and co-curriculum activities.” 
Chia added that he was impressed with his students’ poster concept that called for the “breaking down of barriers”.
“When we have respect and sportsmanship, we can put our differences aside,” said Lee, 16. 
This contest, open to primary and secondary schools, is endorsed by the Education Ministry. 
All nine winning teams of the Outstanding Awards and their messages will be featured in StarEducate on Oct 9 in conjunction with the National Sports Day.

PETALING JAYA: There have been more than 2,000 cases of open burning nationwide from January till last Saturday.
Natural Resources and Envi­ron­ment Minister Datuk Seri Dr Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar said a total of 2,262 cases of open burning had been detected by the Department of Environment (DOE).
Most of the cases, said Dr Wan Junaidi, involved forests (300 cases), bushes (515), construction sites (48), landfill sites (70), industrial areas (15), agricultural land (589) and other small open burning cases (725).
He said the DOE was monitoring the air quality nationwide.
“Hotspots in Sumatra and Kali­mantan, Indonesia, that are still active can cause transboundary haze to reach the west coast of Pe­­ninsular Malaysia and Sarawak,” said Dr Wan Junaidi in a statement yesterday.
The DOE, he said, had increased preventive efforts on open burning activities.
One of the measures taken is activating the Open Burning Prevention Action Plan since Jan 12 that includes land surveillance and enforcement on areas identified, court action and issuance of compounds.
Other measures include monitoring of areas that can catch fire easily and aerial surveillance to prevent burning in forest and rural areas.
Dr Wan Junaidi said the DOE had issued compounds, amounting to RM233,566, for 208 cases from January till August.
As of 5pm yesterday the Air Pollution Index reading in most ci­ties across the country were “healthy” and “moderate”.


Flooded: Villagers of Kampung Batu Hampar waiting for flash flood to recede.

By R.S.N. MURALI MALACCA: A flood victim from Kampung Musai in Bukit Baru here vented her frustration by sending a video footage of her submerged home to the village headman.The villager, in her late 30s, took the video just as water was gushing into her home after a three-hour downpour yesterday.In the footage, she blamed a housing project in front of her home as the cause of the rapidly rising waters.However, village chief and Kam­pung Musai Village Safety and Security Committee chairman Da­­tuk Saat Abu said the flood was caused by an improper irrigation system extending from the village to Taman Putra.“We have brought up the matter to the authorities for some time, but not much has been done to address the situation,” he said.Saat said the continuous rain could have caused the flash flood, which rose in less than an hour.“I understand the villager’s frustration. We will continue to bring up the matter to the state government,” he said.The heavy rain also caused 15 people from three families to be evacuated in Peringgit. Malacca Civil Defence Depart­ment director Lt-Kol (PA) Effendy Ali said all the evacuees from Kampung Pulau Kelapa and Kampung Batu Hampar were being housed at the Peringgit community hall.He said floodwaters began to rise at 6am after a three-hour rainfall. But the water is receding now.

KUALA LUMPUR: Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia intends to work with the fractured opposition for the next general election.
Despite its pending registration with the Registrar of Societies (RoS), its pro-tem president Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said discussions were already underway with members of the opposition and the response had been good.
Muhyiddin, who is the Pagoh MP and former deputy prime minister, said they would not exclude colla­borating with PAS, which is at loggerheads with members of its splinter group Parti Amanah Negara and also the DAP.
“It’s a challenge but it is not insurmountable,” he said yesterday at the committee’s first press conference at the Persatuan Alumni Universiti Malaya clubhouse.
Support for Barisan Nasional, Muhyiddin claimed, was on the decline and there was fertile ground for change.
Negotiations for seat allocations, he said, should be based on the candidate’s ability to win.
Former prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who is Parti Pribumi pro-tem chairman, said they had no problems working with DAP, despite his bad blood with the party when he was in Umno.
“I was their worst enemy for 60 years but on some things, we can agree,” he said.
He said it was the same in Barisan where parties didn’t always agree but could still work together. 
Dr Mahathir also claimed many thousands wanted to join Parti Pribumi but could not until the party was approved by the RoS.
The pro-tem committee, he said, was ready to accept any changes to fulfil RoS requirements.

SERDANG: Police are keeping a close watch on university students who may be influenced by propaganda of the Islamic State (IS), said Deputy Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Noor Rashid Ibrahim.“Even those who liked a sympathetic post about IS on social media are watched by us,” he added.He said this came about because IS would mainly target youths and undergraduates in their recruitment drive.“We have arrested people as young as 16 years old and others who were students,” he told a press conference after attending the graduation ceremony of the annual public universities’ Police Undergra­duate Voluntary Corp (Kor Suksis) at Universiti Putra Malaysia yesterday.On the ongoing Ops Cantas 2, Noor Rashid said police had seized about 10 pistols so far, adding that there had been various successes in cracking down organised crime.On Kor Suksis, he said this year’s graduation had 1,051 graduates.“Kor Suksis members who have completed their three-year officer training programme will be given priority in next year’s recruitment for inspectors,” he added.


Former president SR Nathan - PHOTO: ST FILE

PETALING JAYA: Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has paid tribute to former president SR Nathan, who passed away on Monday night.  
“Mr Nathan’s life is an inspiration to us all. His was a story of how a young boy strove to triumph over his circumstances and make a contribution to society. 
"He held many public service posts, and occupied the highest office in the land,” Lee said in his Facebook posts shortly after Nathan’s passing.  
Nathan, who was the island nation’s longest-serving president, holding office from 1999 to 2011, was described by Lee as a “warm and approachable president who endeared himself to Singaporeans”.  
“He was a warm and approachable president who endeared himself to Singaporeans. He impressed visitors with his knowledge of world affairs, and served with dignity and distinction.”  
Lee added that he had known Nathan for 40 years, and remembered the latter as someone who was guided by a deep sense of duty to the nation.  
“He stepped up each time duty called. He was a true son of Singapore. My condolences to Mrs Nathan and the family. Our thoughts and prayers are with you in this time of grief,” he wrote.  
Nathan, who turned 92 last month, had been in critical condition after suffering a stroke on July 31.  
He died at 9.48pm Monday at the Singapore General Hospital surrounded by his family.  

Singapore president Dr Tony Tan, who had formerly worked with Nathan, also expressed sadness at his passing.  
 
“I had the privilege of working with Mr Nathan from 1996 to 1999 when I was the deputy prime minister and minister for defence,” he said, describing the former president as someone who served with dedication and distinction.  
 
Dr Tony also lauded Nathan’s contribution to the Indian community, saying the latter had played an active role to uplift the community when he was chairman of the Hindu Endowment Board.  
 
“Our thoughts and prayers are with Mrs Nathan and Mr Nathan's family during this time of mourning,” he said in his Facebook posts. 
Nathan leaves behind his wife Urmila, son Osith and daughter Juthika, and three grandchildren.  
Arrangements for the funeral and for the public to pay their last respects are expected to be announced later.

 Former Singapore president SR Nathan dies

SINGAPORE: Singapore's longest-serving president SR Nathan has died peacefully at Singapore General Hospital, the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement on Monday night. He was 92.
 
"The Prime Minister and his Cabinet colleagues are sad to learn of the passing of Mr S R Nathan and would like to convey their condolences to his family," the statement said.
 
"Arrangements for the public to pay respects and for the funeral will be announced later."
 
Nathan, who turned 92 last month, had suffered a stroke on July 31, and was in critical condition.
 
He was Singapore's sixth and longest-serving president, occupying the highest office of the land from 1999 to 2011.
 
Prior to serving as head of state, he had a distinguished 40-year career in public service that took him through the worlds of trade unions, security, and diplomacy.
 
In 1962, he joined the NTUC's Labour Research Unit, handling negotiations between trade unions and employers at a time when labour unrest was widespread and pro-communist elements had infiltrated many unions.
 
Nathan also had two stints at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1961 to 1971 and from 1979 to 1982, the second as First Permanent Secretary.
 
He led the Security and Intelligence Division from 1971 to 1979, and secured the release of hostages from the hijacked ferryboat Laju by accompanying the hijackers on a flight to Kuwait to guarantee their safe passage.
 
After Nathan retired from the civil service in 1982, he became executive chairman of media company The Straits Times Press (1975), the predecessor of Singapore Press Holdings.
 
He was later appointed High Commissioner to Malaysia from 1988 to 1990, and Ambassador to the United States from 1990 to 1996.
 
Upon his return from the US, Nathan was made Ambassador-at-Large and director of the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies (IDSS) at the Nanyang Technological University.
 
Just as he was preparing for retirement, he was asked to run for president in Singapore's second presidential election. In 1999, he was elected unopposed to the first of two terms.
 
He was the first elected president to give approval for the Government's drawdown of the nation's reserves in 2009 amid a global financial crisis, a key power vested in the institution when it was introduced in 1991.

GEORGE TOWN: Cases of domestic violence referred to the Social Welfare Department (JKM) has shown an increase and the fact that it involves senior citizens is indeed worrying, said Women, Family and Community Development Minister Datuk Seri Rohani Abdul Karim. However, she said the causes for the increase were still being investigated. "The number of domestic violence cases involving victims aged 60 and above is on the rise. So, I have to find out why," she told reporters after opening the Penang National Welfare Foundation's Anjung Singgah complex here last night.

KUALA NERUS: Some have tagged him a freak for decorating his motorcycle with 'Jalur Gemilang' flags but that has not deterred Juhari Mat Alias from continuing to do the same every August. The 65-year-old army veteran has been at it for the past 20 years. The Kampung Teluk Ketapang resident not only erects flags on his machine to usher in the Merdeka month but also at public toilets at the Teluk Ketapang Beach where he is currently employed. "I began putting up the 'Jalur Gemilang' after I retired in 1996 because patriotism is too thick in me...indeed, whenever August comes, I will decorate my motorcycle, house and the public toilets where I work, with the 'Jalur Gemilang'. "The people have called me a freak and all sorts of names, (and) that makes me angry! I will find that person and ask personally, 'Am I the one who is mad or is it you who has gone mad? "I told (that person) that I put up all these because I love my country and it is only for a certain period, not all the time," Juhari told Bernama here Monday. He said he would fork out his own money every year to ensure that his surroundings were filled with national flags from early August until the celebration of Malaysia Day on Sept 16. "I have spent hundreds of ringgit to erect these flags. The quantity varies. I will put up bit by bit until the number reaches hundreds. "Actually, how many flags you put up is not important. The most important thing is the patriotism. I am sad to see not many people are keen to fly the 'Jalur Gemilang' when it only costs less than RM2 each for the small ones. "Whenever I see torn flags anywhere, I feel hurt...I feel pity for the flag because there are people who let obsolete flags to fly," said the army veteran of 25 years. Every Malaysian should be proud to fly the 'Jalur Gemilang' at every building and house, not just in August but at all times, said the father of 11 children and 17 grandchildren. He also plans to erect all state flags at his home and work place but said it was not easy to find flags of the other states. "If I manage to get all those flags, I can die in peace," he said.                                                


SEPANG: When six packages arrived at the KL International Airport (KLIA) from Uganda this month and were declared as containing grains (cereals), customs officers suspected there might not be a grain of truth in the declaration. Their suspicions were proven right. When the team of customs enforcement officers opened the packages which had arrived, via Turkish Airlines, they were found to contain 111kg of ivory worth RM946,689, meant for China and Thailand markets to be processed into ornaments, idols and medicines. KLIA Customs director, Datuk Chik Omar Chik Lim said in that case on Aug 4, a group had flown the ivory from Entebbe, Uganda via Turkish Airlines, transit in Istanbul, Turkey before arriving in KLIA. "The packages were declared as grains (cereals) to be sent to a Salak Tinggi (Sepang) address. "Upon inspection, we found that the address did not exist and could not be reached. "No arrest was made and our investigations are underway to track down the smuggler of the seized ivory," he told reporters at KLIA Customs Complex here today. He said this was one of seven cases involving the attempted smuggling of ivory tusks between January and yesterday, totalling almost RM10 million. During the period, the KLIA Customs also foiled two cases of attempted smuggling of Black Pond Tortoise worth about RM19,400, Chik Omar said the cases involving ivory and tortoise smuggling were investigated under Section 135 (1)(d) Customs Act 1967 for possession of prohibited goods without import licence. Meanwhile, the KLIA Customs director today handed over 1,174kg of ivory and semi-finished ivory products worth about RM10.19 million which were seized last year and this year, to the Wildlife and National Parks Department for further action.

KUCHING: A cop was bitten by a married couple who tried to make a getaway after being stopped for suspected drunk driving last night. In the incident at Jalan Matang Baru here, the couple, both in their 40s, were travelling in a Perodua Kancil car with the wife behind the wheel when they were stopped at a police road block. In a statement, Kuching police chief, ACP Abang Ahmad Abang Julai said an argument ensued between the husband and a police officer when the latter was checking the couple’s car boot.

KUANTAN: The Attorney-General's Chambers has filed an appeal against a decision by the Kota Kinabalu High Court in imposing a life imprisonment on nine Filipinos convicted in the Lahad Datu intrusion case. Attorney-General Tan Sri Mohamed Apandi Ali said the notice of appeal was filed last July 27, a day after the punishment was meted out by Judge Stephen Chung on grounds that the punishment did not commensurate with the offence committed. "The law provides death sentence for the offence. So, we will appeal for them to be imposed the death sentence, or at least on their leader," he told reporters when met after opening the annual prosecutor conference here today.

In another development, Mohamed Apandi said he welcomed the establishment of the Special Cyber Court, which would begin operation on Sept 1, as it could expedite disposal of cyber-related cases, which currently took up to a year. "We will also study the need to set up a cyber unit, but as of now, we already have a deputy public prosecutor at the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission, as well as the Commercial and Cyber Unit, which is headed by Abdul Rashid Daud. "We will also provide training to existing deputy public prosecutors to enhance their knowledge and skills relating to cyber laws," he added.  He said the Attorney-General's Chambers would also give advice to the police on cyber offences as they were among offences that were difficult to proof. Meanwhile, in his speech, Mohamed Apandi emphasised the importance of integrity, especially among deputy public prosecutors, and would not hesitate to take action against the corrupt ones. "Let us not open the doors to any quarters to tarnish the good name of the Attorney-General's Chambers," he added. He said they should be prepared to face whatever challenges and threats that come with the job and to emulate Datuk Anthony Kevin Morais, who died while doing his job.                                                 


KUALA LUMPUR: Perbadanan Fidlot Nasional Sdn Bhd (NFCorp) and four others, including its executive chairman Datuk Seri Dr Mohamad Salleh Ismail, failed to reach a settlement over a suit they filed against Public Bank Berhad over leak of confidential account information.

KUALA LUMPUR: The hipster subculture is the latest trend that young people subscribe to, and which has received special attention from both global and local policy-makers. Even WikiHow.com, an online database of how-to guides, has uploaded information on how to be a hipster in terms of fashion, health, lifestyle, indie entertainment and socialising. In Malaysia, hispterism which has been growing for the past few years, has even caught the attention of Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who is carrying out the duties of UMNO deputy president. When opening an UMNO division delegates meeting recently, he called on the party leaders to understand the subculture in the move to win the hearts of young urban voters. The hipster subculture is mainly associated with affluent or middle-class youths with a preference for indie or alternative music, and have varied non-mainstream fashion sensibility, generally progressive political views and alternative lifestyles, among the new trends. Among the party leaders who have adapted well to hipsterism is Youth and Sports Minister Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar, who is also UMNO and Barisan Nasional (BN) Youth leader who is the perfect example of how the subculture could be placed side by side with politics. Not only does Khairy speak, dress up and act like a 'true blue' hipster, the 40-year-old Rembau Member of Parliament also has the natural talent of mixing around well with the young, no matter from which race or background they come from. And the impact of this can be seen from his 1.4 million followers on Twitter, 456,000 on Instagram, and approximately one million likes on his Facebook. Since appointed as Youth and Sports Minister, Khairy has successfully initiated several programmes that have significantly put the millennials closer to the ruling government. National Entrepreneurship Institute (INSKEN) executive director, Norizan Sharif described this group as quite ambitious and prepared to take up any challenge, and work within their own group, besides preferring to be less dependent on the government. "What the government needs to do is to engage with this group, and facilitate their business needs and requirements," he suggested. Former Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia sociology lecturer, Dr Fatimah Abdullah feels that politicians and the government need to engage with this group in various activities including volunteerism, arts, gardening, crafts, and even creative writing so that their talents can be nurtured. "Try to be appreciative of them, then the millennials would feel they are part of society and their existence well recognised," she said. A young Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) lecturer, who wished to remain anonymous, said the approach must be made in line with the youth's aspirations. "For example, setting up AKHI (Akademi Kepimpinan Kapten Hussein or Captain Hussein Leadership Academy) by UMNO Youth is a good start in order to be close to the young. The way the programmes are conducted - quite casual and laidback... will put young people at ease. "But the hipster kind of approach must be comprehensive because the needs of today's youths vary. Some of them like to be engaged on official or professional platforms like the Youth Parliament or AKHI, while some prefer to be engaged in an unofficial basis like a teh tarik talk or something similar." He said communication would be successful if their grouses were heard and addressed accordingly over issues like the lack of affordable homes, rising cost of living, and employment. "I think these are (among) the pressing problems faced by the urbanites," the lecturer said. Azraei Muhamad, the author of 'Enam Angka Menjelang Dua Puluh Lima', believes that it is crucial for the government and politicians to have a better understanding of the hipster generation. "In this era of free access to information, there is a need for more engagements between the government and politicians and the rakyat, in order to empathise with the people over issues and problems, and to take the necessary action," he said.                                                 


SINGAPORE: "Heard that you're not feeling well. I hope you're all right. Get well soon," says Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak to Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong via Twitter account late Sunday. "Thanks for your good wishes. My doctors tell me I should be OK," Lee then replied around 2am. Lee was taken ill while speaking at the country's National Day Rally (NDR) around 9.40pm yesterday. Lee, 64, was scheduled to end his English speech at 10pm after delivering his Malay and Mandarin versions at 6.45pm. Lee managed to continue his speech after almost an hour of rest and wrapped up his speech in 15 minutes. Immediately after delivering his speech, Lee went to the Singapore General Hospital for a precautionary check-up. In his NDR speech, Lee had touched on Singapore's relationship with Malaysia and Indonesia. Lee described both countries as Singapore's two most important partners.  Last month, Lee said he was in Putrajaya, Malaysia, to witness the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding on the High Speed Rail between Singapore and Malaysia. "PM Najib hosted us to lunch. The durian was good, but the High Speed Rail will be better!," he said while the large screen behind him showed a photo of him with Najib.                                                 


KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia may receive about 20 percent excess rainfall during the upcoming southwest monsoon season which could result in flooding, say climate expert. Vice President of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), Prof Datuk Dr Azizan Abu Samah said the excess rain was due to effects of the La Nina phenomenon. "This year we will experience the La Nina phenomenon, and most likely we will have a surplus of rain brought by the southwest monsoon season," he told Bernama. He was met at the preview and discussion session of the documentary film 'Ice and The Sky', held in conjunction with the 2016 SCAR Conference here, Sunday. Azizan, who is also the Malaysian Antarctic Research Centre director said the northeast monsoon from this November to March next year, would also result in stronger winds.  


GOPENG: The contracts of food service providers and operators at school canteens or dormitory dining halls will be terminated immediately, in the event of food poisoning cases. Education Minister Datuk Seri Mahdzir Khalid said the action was necessary as multiple warning notices to the concerned parties have not been effective. "Food poisoning in schools is something serious, which is why we (ministry) do not want to give anymore warnings. This clause (for termination of service) will be added as a new term in the contract of appointment for food operators or providers. "I will go back to the ministry and check on this," he told reporters after opening the Gopeng UMNO division delegates' meeting here Sunday. Mahdzir, who is also UMNO Supreme Council member, was commenting on an increase in the number of food poisoning cases in schools recently. In the latest case, 53 students from the Kuala Kangsar Malay College (MCKK) were confirmed to be suffering from food poisoning after having meals provided by the food operator at the college dining hall last Wednesday. Initial investigations revealed that the van used to transport food was dirty, while other utensils such as food trays, jugs, water dispensers, bowls, and plates were not cleaned properly. Yesterday, Perak State Health Director Datuk Dr Juita Ghazalie said 10 food poisoning cases involving schools across Perak had been recorded so far, this month. 


KOTA BELUD: Two teachers drowned after a boat with 10 people on board capsized while on its way to Pulau Mantanani, near here from Kampung Rampayan Laut, Sunday evening. A spokesperson for the Kota Belud Fire and Rescue Station said the dead were identified as Limun Gamburud, headmaster of Sekolah Kebangsaan (SK) Mantanani and Kamariah Hamdan, a teacher in the same school. "Both victims were pronounced dead by medical officers and eight more victims who are being treated at the Kota Belud Hospital. They are reported to be in stable condition," he said when contacted by Bernama. He said the Kota Belud Fire and Rescue Station received information about the incident at 3.45pm and a team of eight firemen in a fire engine arrived at the scene about 25 minutes later. The rescue operation ended at 7.25pm. Mohd Mustazar Bundah, a teacher at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Arshad and also Kamariah's relative said he was shocked and saddened by the incident. He said Kamariah who had just been transferred from SK Nahaba was very concerned about the wellbeing of her students. "The last time I met her, I had asked about her teaching experience there (SK Mantanani). According to her (Kamariah), every place and school had its own challenges," he said adding that she leaves behind four children. 


JOHOR BAHRU: A Singaporean has been reported missing after entering the country via the Malaysia-Singapore Second Link in Gelang Patah on Aug 15.

Iskandar Puteri police chief Supt Noor Hashim Mohamad said the police received a report on Ow's disappearance from his mother at 10.41am, three days ago, at the Tanjung Kupang police station in Gelang Patah.

KUALA LUMPUR: "If I declare my assets, my wife and kids might get kidnapped." This was the response of Federal Territories Minister Datuk Seri Tengku Adnan Tengku Mansor when asked about the challenge by Parti Keadilan Rakyat's (PKR) communication director Fahmi Fadzil for him and KL Mayor Datuk Seri Mhd Amin Nordin to declare their assets to the public. Tengku Adnan said he was a businessman before becoming a politician and therefore has a lot of assets. "I will not declare my assets to the public. I will only do what is needed of me, that is to declare to the Prime Minister. "That boy from PKR who asked me to declare my assets must not be right in the head. Every year, it is government policy for me to declare my assets to the Prime Minister with the rest of the Cabinet ministers. As for the Mayor, he is required to declare his assets to the Chief Secretary to the Government," he said. Tengku Adnan, who was met after the launching of the 10th National Defence Medical Centre (NDMC) Worldwide Alumni Convention here today, said every ministry has an integrity unit that handles issues pertaining to assets declaration.    Fahmi had, last Friday, called for Tengku Adnan and Mhd Amin to publicly declare their assets as a way to lead by example for other government leaders and civil servants. READ: MACC calls 13 people to assist probe into alleged corruption involving Datuk Seri, Datuk Meanwhile, in a subsequent statement released today, Fahmi said the response given by the FT Minister about his family's safety was not satisfactory, from the viewpoint of democracy and good governance. He said the system of civil servants declaring their assets only to their respective superiors was clearly flawed, seeing how it has failed to prevent some individuals from acquiring large amount of assets via corruption, as alleged by the Malaysian Anti Corruption Commission last week.

Therefore, check and balance towards those who have executive decision-making powers, including the FT Minister, need to be placed at a higher level than where it is now, including declaring their assets to the public. "The FT Minister and KL Mayor need not worry about criminals and robbers, because the police would safeguard their safety, just as how they safeguard the safety of all Malaysians," said Fahmi.                                                 


BATU GAJAH: The teeth-gritting, nail-biting men's singles badminton semifinal of the Rio Olympics between Datuk Lee Chong Wei and China's Lin Dan last Friday night proved too much for an elderly man here. While watching the match at his younger sister’s house around 8.55pm, Lum Wah Long, 64, suddenly collapsed and died. According to his cousin Bibi Lam, Wah Long was so excited while watching the match with his family that at one point he stood up to cheer when the points were nearing 20-20 in the rubber set. “But a few seconds after he stood up and cheered, he sat back down to take a breath. After that he just collapsed and lost consciousness,” she said. She said, a relative then tried to wake Wah Long up, but he could only open his eyes for a moment before slipping out again. She said the family then called an ambulance. When the medical personnel arrived, they checked his pulse but he was already gone. “My cousin was an avid badminton fan. Throughout the Rio Olympics, he never missed a game, be it the doubles or singles match. “But, I guess the exhilarating match between Chong Wei and Lin Dan proved too much for him,” Bibi said. The victim’s younger brother, Toong Wong, when contacted by Astro AWANI, declined comments as he was still shocked by his brother's demise and was currently sorting out his funeral. Meanwhile, Perak Health director, Datuk Dr Juita Ghazali when contacted confirmed the incident. “The victim died while watching the semifinals match and the Batu Gajah Hospital paramedics confirmed that he died at home. “However, for the (men’s singles) badminton finals yesterday, there were no reports of any deaths received,” she added. When contacted, Batu Gajah OCPD ACP Mohd Nasri Omar said Wah Long’s death has been classified as sudden death. “Based on preliminary investigation, the victim had a history of heart ailment. He died of a heart attack,” he told Astro AWANI.                                                 

 Coastguards are warning people to stay a safe distance from rough seas after six people died around Britain. "It's not often we see winds of such high strength at this time of year," national maritime operations commander for the UK Coastguard Tris Newey told the Today programme.
 


DETROIT (AP) — Briefly Monday, it looked like the federal government was going to push all 50 states to ban the use of cellphones and other wireless devices while people are driving.


But the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration now says it was all a mistake.


The agency posted non-binding guidelines on distracted driving for states on a federal website Monday morning. The guidelines recommended that states prohibit use of hands-free as well as hand-held devices. State laws control use of phones by drivers.


But the agency says the guidelines were not fully reviewed before being posted and would be withdrawn. The agency says it has no plans to recommend a cellphone ban.


The documents were posted on a website that previews actions to be published in the Federal Register.


They appeared to signal a major policy change for NHTSA, which in the past has not sought bans on cellphone use by adult drivers. The agency has pushed states to ban texting by all drivers and cellphone use by young drivers.


Currently, 14 states and Washington, D.C., ban use of hand-held devices by all drivers, but no states have prohibited use of hands-free devices, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association. Forty-six states and Washington, D.C., ban texting by all drivers, while 38 states and Washington, D.C. ban all cellphone use by novice drivers.


In 2014, 3,179 people were killed and an estimated 431,000 injured in crashes involving distracted drivers, NHTSA said in the documents. That's about 10 percent of all fatal crashes and 18 percent of injury crashes.

A noise that sounded like gunfire sparked panic at a French Riviera resort as people rushed to flee what they believed was a terror attack, causing a number of injuries, the fire service said.
The noise was caused by firecrackers thrown from a car, local radio France Bleu Azur reported, adding that around 40 people were injured in the incident late Sunday in Juan-les-Pins.
Video footage showed tables and chairs overturned on the terraces of cafes and restaurants near the beach and people screaming in the stampede.
The incident came amid heightened tension in France after a string of attacks claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group, including the July 14 massacre in the Mediterranean city of Nice when a Tunisian ploughed a truck into crowds celebrating Bastille Day, killing 85 people.
A state of emergency was declared in France after November's IS attacks in Paris which left 130 people dead.
The fire service in Juan-les-Pins, known for its vibrant nightlife and annual jazz festival, said a number of people were lightly injured but did not say how many.
Police were examining CCTV footage to determine the exact cause of the incident.
The Nice Matin newspaper quoted witnesses as saying beachgoers rushed into the streets of the busy nightlife area on hearing what they feared was gunfire.
One witness told AFP he saw "a lot of people running" in a "stampede caused by the panic" that "left dozens of people slightly injured".
The injured were treated at the scene, some in the restaurants, and "police cordoned off the town centre," he said.
In New York on Sunday, unfounded reports of shots fired at the city's main John F. Kennedy airport triggered scenes of panic, evacuations and huge flight delays.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on Thursday put the military on highest state of alert along the frontier with Crimea after Russia accused Kiev of making attempted incursions into the annexed region. 
Moscow's FSB security service said Wednesday it had thwarted "terrorist attacks" by Ukraine's military on the Black Sea peninsula that Russia seized from Ukraine in March 2014.
Poroshenko said he met Ukraine's top brass as well as foreign ministry officials to discuss the latest flare-up in tensions between the two ex-Soviet foes.
"I ordered a high-alert level on the administrative line with Crimea and contact line in eastern Ukraine," he tweeted.
‘War games’
Russian President Vladimir Putin also held a meeting Thursday with security chiefs where discussed "additional measures for ensuring security for citizens and essential infrastructure in Crimea," the Kremlin said in a statement. Russia also said its navy - whose Black Sea Fleet is based in annexed Crimea - would start war games to practice repelling underwater attacks by terrorists.
Using some of his most aggressive rhetoric against Kiev since the height of the war two years ago, Putin pledged to take counter-measures against Ukraine for allegedly sending saboteurs into Crimea to carry out terrorist acts.
The Russian security service said one of its officers was killed in armed clashes while arresting "terrorists" on the night of August 6-7.
It said another Russian soldier died in a firefight with "sabotage-terrorist" groups sent by the Ukrainian military on August 8.
Ukraine promptly dismissed the Kremlin’s allegation.
"These fantasies are only another pretext for the next military threats toward Ukraine," Poroshenko said in a statement.
40,000 troops in Crimea
Following a closed-door session of the UN Security Council called by Kiev, Ukraine’s UN Ambassador Volodymyr Yelchenko said Russia had amassed more than 40,000 troops in Crimea.
"These numbers may reflect some very bad intentions and this is the last thing we would like to happen," he told reporters. "My biggest hope is that this discussion (with the UN) will help the Russian Federation to understand that they cannot really continue with this kind of behaviour."
Russian UN Ambassador Vitaly Churkin dismissed concerns about a Russian military build-up. He described the Security Council meeting as "useful" to explain the situation.
"Instead of counting our military they should be bringing an end to the conflict in Donetsk and stop shelling civilians in Donetsk and Luhansk," Churkin told reporters after the meeting.
Separately, the United States said Thursday it was "extremely concerned" about tensions between Ukraine and Russia.
"Our position, as I said yesterday, is well known: Crimea is part of Ukraine and is recognised as such by the international community," said State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau. "We call for the avoidance of any actions that would escalate the situation."
Russia vs Ukraine
Russia's annexation of Crimea came just weeks after the ouster of Ukraine's Moscow-backed president in a pro-European Union revolt that claimed more than 100 lives.
The seizure provoked stiff economic sanctions imposed against Russia by Kiev's Western allies and was followed by a pro-Moscow insurgency in eastern Ukraine that has left more than 9,500 people dead since April 2014.
Russia denies Western charges it is backing the conflict in retaliation for Ukraine's shift out of its orbit.
Whatever the truth of this latest potentially dangerous dispute, the allegations have already scuppered planned talks about eastern Ukraine slated for the sidelines of a G20 summit in China next month. Putin said such talks would now be "pointless."

WASHINGTON A senior aide to U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump signaled a possible shift in his hardline immigration policies on Sunday, saying his plans to deport 11 million people who are in the country illegally were under review.Trump has put his vow to toughen the country's immigration policies at the center of his campaign. He has promised to carry out mass deportations and build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, proposals that critics have assailed as inhumane and too costly and unrealistic to achieve. Trailing Democrat Hillary Clinton in opinion polls for the Nov. 8 election and struggling to broaden his support beyond the white working-class voters who have been his base of support, the New York businessman has reached out in recent days to black and Hispanic voters. On Sunday, his new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told CNN that Trump was committed to a "fair and humane" approach to those living in the country illegally.  "What he supports is to make sure we enforce the law, we are respectful of those Americans who are looking for well-paying jobs and that we are fair and humane to those who live among us in this country," Conway said on "State of the Union."Pressed on whether Trump's plans would include a "deportation force" that the candidate previously pledged to set up, she replied: "To be determined."
Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, a close ally of Trump, told CBS's "Face the Nation" that Trump was still working through his plans for deportations should he win the White House.  "He's wrestling with how to do that. People that are here unlawfully, came into the country against our laws, are subject to being removed. That's just plain fact," the Alabama lawmaker said. "He's thinking that through."Trump has also been rebuked by opponents for his proposal to impose a temporary "total and complete shutdown" of Muslims seeking to enter the country, later rolled back to focus on countries with "a proven history of terrorism." Clinton has accused Trump of sowing divisiveness and said she would propose a path to citizenship for some migrants living in the United States illegally. The former secretary of state has said that militant groups like Islamic State have begun using Trump's proposed Muslim ban as a recruitment tool. 
CAMPAIGN SHAKE-UP
Conway's comments came after Trump announced last week a major reshuffling of his campaign. Trump promoted Conway, who had been a senior adviser, to the role of campaign manager and hired Stephen Bannon, head of the Breitbart News website, as campaign chief executive.
The Trump campaign said on Friday that campaign chairman Paul Manafort was resigning.The campaign's new leadership combines Bannon, a combative conservative, with Conway, a data-driven analyst who has been trying to broaden Trump's appeal to women and independent voters. Trump's support has slumped in national polls in recent weeks and surveys in pivotal states such as Pennsylvania and New Hampshire have shown a widening lead for Clinton.A Reuters/Ipsos survey released on Friday showed Clinton leading Trump nationally by 8 percentage points, 42 percent to 34 percent.Trump vowed at a campaign rally in Fredericksburg, Virginia, on Saturday to return the Republican Party to the values of President Abraham Lincoln, who issued the Emancipation Proclamation and championed the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution during the U.S. Civil War that led to the abolition of slavery in 1865.Earlier on Saturday, Trump met with a group of Hispanic leaders as part of a new National Hispanic Advisory Council to the campaign.

NEW YORK A New York City grand jury on Monday indicted a Brooklyn man who is accused of fatally shooting a Muslim cleric and his assistant this month after they left a mosque in Queens.Oscar Morel, 35, was charged with one count of first degree murder, two counts of second degree murder and two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, court documents showed. He has denied committing the killings.
"The defendant's alleged actions strike at the very heart of our county's Muslim community," Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said in a statement on Monday. "Both victims were gentlemen of peace and their deaths are a devastating loss to their families and the community that they served."Imam Maulana Akonjee, 55, and Thara Uddin, 64, were gunned down after they left their mosque on Saturday, Aug. 13, in the Ozone Park neighborhood of Queens in an attack that shocked the area's largely Bangladeshi community.
Authorities have said the gunman's motive remains unclear and the possibility it was a hate crime is being investigated. Morel, who has been held without bail since his initial court appearance last week, will be arraigned on the grand jury's indictment at a later date. 
If convicted, he faces up to life in prison without the possibility of parole.Akonjee, a father of seven, emigrated to the United States from Bangladesh several years ago. Community members who knew him well described the slain imam as a humble man who lived and breathed his religious faith.  (Reporting by Gina Cherelus; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Dan Grebler)



CHICAGO The cash-strapped Chicago public school system will rely on a $1.55 billion line of credit in fiscal 2017 to boost cash flow, up from $1.065 billion in fiscal 2016, according to a briefing document released by the district on Monday.The bigger credit line will be on the agenda for the Chicago Board of Education's Wednesday meeting, along with a $5.4 billion operating budget, a $250 million property tax hike earmarked for teacher pensions and authorization to issue up to $945 million of general obligation bonds for capital projects.
The nation's third-largest public school district said it needs access to $485 million more in short-term funding as it ends the practice of restructuring outstanding bonds to push off debt payments and because its receipt of property taxes will be a few weeks later next year.Chicago Public Schools (CPS) said it was working to finalize deals with lenders. Interest costs for the credit lines are budgeted at $34 million in fiscal 2017. The district tapped a bank line of credit in June to complete a $676 million fiscal 2016 contribution to its teachers' pension fund. 
Escalating pension payments, drained reserves and debt dependency have pushed CPS' credit ratings to junk. As a result, investors have demanded hefty yields for the district's bonds.
The proposed budget to be voted on by the board of education, appointed by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, relies on optimistic assumptions of union give backs and added funding support from Illinois' gridlocked state government. (Reporting by Karen Pierog; Editing by Bill Trott)

In January, a Tanzanian student was assaulted and partially stripped by a mob in the southern Indian city of Bangalore after a Sudanese student's car ran over and killed a local woman.Shocked by the incident and other similar attacks on Africans in India, independent photographer Mahesh Shantaram began documenting the lives of Africans living in India.Beginning with Bangalore, Shantaram travelled to the cities of Jaipur, Delhi and Manipal, choosing to focus on students, as they are a small and vulnerable group.Shantaram's series of intimate portraits is part of an upcoming exhibition organised by Tasveer. "Each portrait plays a part in unravelling the complex web of experiences of Africans in India that, put together, paint a picture of loneliness, placelessness and a sense of hostility," says art expert Caroline Bertram, in an original text on the exhibition.

                    Dexter Neal, three, died after being bitten by a dog
                

The Dangerous Dogs Act has "never really worked" because it only deals with certain breeds, a Tory MP has said as he called for a review of the law.Andrew Rosindell, a Staffordshire bull terrier owner, said resources should be used to deal with any dangerous dogs, not just the four banned breeds.His call follows the death on Thursday of three-year-old Dexter Neal, who was mauled by an American bulldog in Essex.His uncle Ashley Coe wrote on Facebook of the "absolutely devastating loss".Describing Dexter as his "darling nephew", he wrote in his post: "I can't even begin to describe the state we are all in."''Out of control'Mr Rosindell, MP for Romford, said the dog which attacked Dexter was not one of the breeds banned under the 1991 act, adding "You do need a complete review of this legislation. It's simply not effective."Breeds banned by the act are pit bull terriers, the Japanese tosa, dogo Argentino and fila Brasileiro, types that have traditionally been bred for fighting.The act also makes it an offence for an owner to allow any dog "to be dangerously out of control". Mr Rosindell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he had long argued that the problem is not with the dogs but their owners."There are lots of breeds of dogs that can be just as dangerous as the ones listed in the Dangerous Dogs Act so to get rid of this legislation to replace it with a more flexible form of regulation means that the police and local authorities could then focus on where there is a known dangerous dog or an irresponsible owner," he told BBC Radio Four's Today programme."It is impossible for authorities to check every single dog [and owner]... but certainly if there's one incident then that dog and that owner would then have to be checked and warned, and if there's a second incident, then the authorities may want to take action.

                    Pit bull terriers are one of the four breeds banned by the Dangerous Dogs Act
                

"The dog is like a human being almost. If you treat it badly, if you train it to do bad things, if you torment it, it will become aggressive. "The problem is they only really have powers to act on those four breeds so they waste a lot of time on dogs that aren't dangerous instead of dealing with the ones that are."Dogs 'vilified'Just days before Dexter's death, David Ellam, 52, from Huddersfield, was attacked and killed by a dog which had been returned to its owner despite concerns that it was dangerous.After his death, Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary, said she believed the act was "completely flawed"."We've been given the idea that we are all secure because the Dangerous Dogs Act has vilified a certain type of dog and therefore, as long as they're illegal, we're all safe," she said."Any dog can be dangerous if it is wrongly handled and wrongly trained."The Dangerous Dogs Act has been amended over time.In 2014, sentencing guidelines in England and Wales were changed to raise the maximum jail sentence for a fatal dog attack from two years to 14.The law was also extended to include attacks which happen on private property and the police and authorities were given powers to require owners to attend dog training classes or muzzle their dog in public.A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: "Any dog can become dangerous if it is kept by irresponsible owners in the wrong environment which is why the Dangerous Dogs Act covers any type of dog that is dangerously out of control."

With around 90 days left until the presidential election in the United States, there can no longer be any doubt that Donald Trump is a liar, narcissist and agitator. As president, he would be a danger for the entire world.


A liar because his entire campaign is based on selling his followers a concoction of falsehoods, conspiracy and utter nonsense. On Wednesday, he had this to say about President Obama: "He's the founder of ISIS. He's the founder of ISIS. He's the founder. He founded ISIS." Trump is betting on the fact that we live in a post-factual age in which it no longer matters whether or not something is true, but whether it is believed by the right people.
Trump is a narcissist whose bragging is unceasing ("I have the best words"), for whom other politicians' assessments of him only count if they like him ("Putin called me a genius") and who radicalizes himself through the applause of his most zealous supporters. The greater the cheering he gets with his obscenities, the more over-the-top he becomes. When it comes to Hillary Clinton, his followers have long shouted: "Hang the bitch" and "Kill the bitch."
Trump is an agitator who famously referred to Mexicans as rapists and said he wanted to refuse Muslims entry into the United States. Last week, he offhandedly suggested the possibility of an armed uprising or gun violence against Clinton. If Clinton is elected president and names a judge to the Supreme Court, Trump told his fans, "Nothing you can do, folks." But he promptly added: "Although the Second Amendment people -- maybe there is, I don't know."
Trump left open what that might be, but there can be little doubt about what he meant. Trump, who has repeatedly incited violence in the past, has now pushed the limits of what can be said even further. His crude political notions aside, this proves that Trump lacks the character necessary to be president. A man like him must never be given the nuclear launch codes.


Donald Trump is also well on his way toward losing the election. Since his verbal attacks against the Muslim Khan family, he has fallen way behind Clinton in the polls. Even in states like Georgia or Missouri, traditionally Republican strongholds, the Democratic nominee suddenly has a chance. Many moderate Republicans, particularly women, could not in good conscience vote for Trump. Indeed, a victory for Trump has become an unlikely outcome. And yet unlikely things are always happening in the world. November is still a long way away. Even so, it's not as if there's suddenly going to be a transformed, reasonable Trump who runs the kind of normal campaign that many Republicans had hoped for.
Even if Trump loses, his legacy will be horrible. He has blown the Republican Party to smithereens with his populism and now stands smugly in the ruins. The old, two-party system as we knew it will no longer exist after this election. The forces that Trump has raised, which brought him this far, aren't going anywhere. The fact that a liar, narcissist and agitator could make it this far is a harbinger of the battle to come for liberal forces -- and not only in the United States. Now democracy must be protected from rumors, hate and totalitarianism.
In nearly every Western country, there is a part of the population -- one that is usually poorly educated and economically disadvantaged -- that is interested in smashing the old system and replacing it with a darker new one. That's also why Donald Trump represents one of the gravest threats of our time.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Court records show Shannen Doherty has settled a lawsuit against her former business managers, who she accused of leaving her without health insurance and caused a delay in doctors diagnosing her with breast cancer.


A settlement notice filed Friday states the settlement is contingent on unspecified conditions that need to be completed within 45 days.


The former "Beverly Hills, 90210" star sued the accounting firm Tanner Mainstain Glynn & Johnson and one of its former partners in August 2015, alleging they mismanaged her money and allowed her health insurance to lapse in 2014.


Doherty has kept her cancer battle in the public eye. Last month, she posted several pictures on Instagram showing her in various stages of cutting off her hair.


The settlement was first reported Monday by celebrity website TMZ.

MILWAUKEE (AP) — Wisconsin's attorney general acknowledged Monday that former Milwaukee police officers, now working for the state Department of Justice, are investigating the fatal shooting of a black man by a Milwaukee officer that triggered two nights of violence.


Attorney General Brad Schimel said he doesn't see a conflict in using former Milwaukee officers in the investigation into the Aug. 13 shooting of Sylville K. Smith.


Smith, 23, was killed after what Milwaukee police said was a brief foot chase when he ran from a traffic stop. A few hours after Smith's death, a protest on the city's largely black north side erupted into violence that reignited the following night in the Sherman Park neighborhood.


"Milwaukee PD has about 2,000 sworn officers as I understand. The likelihood that there would be some relationship between a particular patrol officer, who's going to be much younger than an experienced detective... is small. And if there is any relationship at all, that officer, that investigator would not be permitted to have any role in the investigation," Schimel said at a news conference in downtown Milwaukee.


He said the DOJ hires many retired officers to work for the Division of Criminal Investigation in the region that they have previously worked. An agency spokesman later said DCI has about 100 officers statewide; of 18 field agents in the Milwaukee office, eight once worked for the Milwaukee Police Department.


State Rep. David Bowen, who grew up in the Sherman Park neighborhood, questioned the use of former Milwaukee officers in the investigation and called for Schimel to turn the case over to the U.S. Department of Justice.


"People are crying out for transparency and crying out for accountability," said Bowen, who represents a large portion of the city's north side.


Schimel said his investigators have interviewed all "critical witnesses" at least once, but the investigation into the fatal shooting of Smith is not yet complete. His office has been working closely with Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, who ultimately will decide whether any charges are warranted against the officer who shot Smith, he said.


The attorney general said there are two videos from body cameras worn by two of the three officers who were at the scene of the shooting that show similar vantage points, but that no video or still shots from the video will be released until Chisholm is done with the case. There is no surveillance video from the neighborhood, he said.


While the video is a component of the investigation, Schimel said it's just one piece among many sources of information.


"They give only a narrow and incomplete glimpse of the overall picture," he said.


The American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin has pressed Schimel's office to release the body camera video. Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said the video clearly shows Smith was holding a handgun and turned toward the officer when he was shot.


Schimel said a 30-second audio delay, set up by the Milwaukee Police Department, means the initial portion of the video, from the time the officers turned on the body cameras, has no sound. The shooting happened very quickly, he added.


"It's not easy to see everything unless you slow it down" he said.


Smith's family has been cooperative in the investigation, Schimel said. The Wisconsin Department of Justice is investigating the shooting, as required by state law for any fatal shootings involving police.

TRIPOLI, Libya, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- The United Nations-backed unity government that is operating in Libya is not working, the nation's House of Representatives communicated Monday.
The Libyan lawmaking body issued a vote of no-confidence Monday, 61-1, against the Government of National Accord -- which was put in place by the U.N. after Muammar Gaddafi's removal from power in 2011.
In all, 101 House members attended Monday's vote but 39 abstained from voting, 61 voted against the unity government and one voted in favor.
The vote went against the Government of National Accord, which was created by the Libyan Political Agreement in December. The U.N. Security Council approved the interim government, but lawmakers do not support its cabinet membership.
It wasn't immediately clear what impact Monday's vote will have on the temporary government, or whether it will result in a cabinet shakeup.
The vote is a blow to efforts of democracy in the North African nation, which has endured severe conflict since Gaddafi's ouster. It also follows two years of internal strife triggered in 2014 when the House of Representatives were forced by militias to flee Tripoli.
The House of Representatives, known similarly as the Council of Deputies, also voiced opposition to the cabinet and Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj.
Sunday, al-Serraj's Presidential Council sent a letter to Libyan officials to make clear the makeup of the cabinet is not yet complete.
"We are in the process of naming new ministers within the next few days; therefore, the cabinet is not final," it said.


CARACAS, Venezuela, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has vowed to expand a welfare healthcare program to all of the South American country's states by early 2017.
The MisiÃ³n Barrio Adentro, or Into the Neighborhood Mission, was created by late former President Hugo Chavez in 2003. The program seeks to provide publicly funded healthcare, including dental care, to impoverished Venezuelan communities.
The program, credited for decreasing infant mortality rates, was initially praised by the World Health Organization and UNICEF but the program has waned in recent years as many of the thousands of clinics built under the program became abandoned and the medical personnel who operated within them -- mostly Cuban medics -- left.
In a speech at the Venezuelan presidential palace, Maduro said the government still has the capacity to improve the program -- despite the crippling economic crisis the country faces.
"We have made great progress in caring for children, youths and the population in general, but we could still do more, because we have resources to do so," Maduro said Saturday. "This program should be implemented as a prioritized policy to guarantee better quality of life for all Venezuelans."
Maduro said he rejects the call to return Venezuela's healthcare system to a privately run institution.
"No. No to capitalism. No to social, political and economic regression of our country," Maduro said.
Venezuela is undergoing a critical economic crisis in which basic necessities including medicines and food are either in short supply or not available.


SINGAPORE, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- S.R. Nathan, who was Singapore's longest-serving president until 2011, died Monday at age of 92 after having a stroke on July 31, the prime minister's office said.
Nathan, 92, was in critical condition in the intensive care unit at Singapore General Hospital for the past month. It was his second stroke in two years.
Nathan was in office for two terms from 1999 to 2011.
Before that he was permanent secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ambassador to the United States, director of the Security and Intelligence Division and executive chairman of The Straits Times Press.
As president of Singapore, Nathan initiated the President's Challenge in 2000, which raised more than $100 million for more than 500 beneficiaries during his two terms of office.
His successor as seventh president, Dr. Tony Tan, wrote on Facebook: "Our thoughts and prayers are with Mrs. Nathan and Mr. Nathan's family during this time of mourning."
The prime minister's office said Nathan would lie in state at the Parliament House from Thursday morning until noon Friday. A state funeral was scheduled for Friday afternoon at the University Cultural Center, after which there will be a private cremation.
Nathan's death comes one day after Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, 64, fainted during a televised national address, disappearing for nearly 90 minutes before returning to finish the speech. He told the country he was fine but would be having a full medical exam afterward.
Lee, who has been in power since 2004, spoke for more than two hours in several languages at National Day Rally.
Lee, a cancer survivor, later told listeners he was dehydrated.


GAZIANTEP, Turkey, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- The death toll in the Gaziantep wedding bombing in Turkey has risen to 54. Authorities said about half of those killed -- 29 -- were children.
The bombing was carried out by a child aged 12 to 14 on Saturday, possibly under the direction of the Islamic State, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said. About 44 victims have been identified and buried. The death toll rose after three people died while receiving treatment in hospitals.
About 66 people injured, 14 of which critically, are in hospitals receiving treatment. The blast occurred in the city of Gaziantep, about 60 miles north of the war-torn Syrian city of Aleppo. More than 200 people were packed into a street in the district of Sahinbey for the Kurdish wedding when the explosion occurred around 11 p.m on Saturday.
Erdogan in a statement before his television appearance said there is "no difference" between the IS, which is based in neighboring Syria, the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party and what the Turkish government is calling the Fethullah Terrorist Organization, followers of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. Erdogan blames Gulen for the July 15 failed coup d'etat in which 240 people were killed and has called for his extradition by the United States.
"Our country and our nation have again only one message to those who attack us -- you will not succeed," Erdogan said Sunday. "Those, who cannot overcome Turkey and try to provoke people by abusing ethnic and sectarian sensitiveness will not prevail."

WASHINGTON, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Four out of five Americans approve of laws allowing voters to cast ballots early and mandating photo identification at the polls, a new survey from Gallup research shows.
According to the new poll, 80 percent of those questioned said they favor the ability to vote early and laws that require voters to prove their identity before they head into the booth.
On the issue of voter identification, 95 percent of Republicans polled favored the law -- compared with just 63 percent of Democrats. The GOP has traditionally been more supportive of voter ID laws, claiming they prevent voter fraud. Some Democrats, though, oppose them and argue that they discourage some minority voters from participating.
On early voting, 85 percent of Democrats said they support it, in contrast to just 74 percent of GOP respondents. Analysts believe that's the case because, among other reasons, early voting is most popular among minority and lower income citizens.
According to the survey, 80 percent of Democrats favor automatic voter registration, compared with only a slight majority -- 51 percent -- of Republicans.
Automatic voter registration has been implemented in five states -- California, Connecticut, Oregon, Vermont and West Virginia -- and is a part of the Democratic Party's official 2016 presidential campaign platform.
For the poll, Gallup surveyed about 1,000 adults in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., between Aug. 15-16. The margin of error is plus-or-minus 4 percentage points.

MIAMI, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Tropical Storm Fiona weakened to a depression in the Atlantic on Monday, but two new storms are developing with one possibly threatening the East Coast next week.
Fiona's maximum sustained winds early Monday were near 35 mph, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The sustained gusts were 40 mph on Sunday. A storm is listed as a tropical storm when it reaches 39 mph.
Fiona is centered about 670 miles southeast of Bermuda and is moving west-northwest at about 18 mph. Meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center predict little change in strength during the next two days.
Two new systems could be cause for concern in the next week, with the first storm possibly threatening the U.S. East Coast in 7-10 days.
The first storm, a tropical wave about 850 miles east of the Lesser Antilles, will bring rain and winds to those islands by midweek. Dry air is expected to slow its development as it moves westward to west-northwest at 15 to 20 mph. Forecasters give it a 20 percent chance of becoming a named storm in the next 48 hours, but its chances improve after that as it is expected to curve through the Caribbean and then over the Bahamas.
The second system appears to be forming into a tropical depression off West Africa. This system is expected to move west to west-northwest at 15 to 20 mph over the eastern tropical Atlantic. Forecasters give a 100 percent chance of becoming a named storm in the next 48 hours.
After Fiona, the next two hurricane names are Gaston and Hermine.

HONOLULU, Aug. 22 (UPI) -- Akie Abe, the wife of Japanese Prime Minister Sinzo Abe, made a surprise visit to the Pearl Harbor memorial in Hawaii, offering flowers and a prayer.
Akie Abe made the two-hour visit Sunday while her husband attended the Summer Olympic closing ceremonies in Rio de Janeiro. Japan's first lady is known for comments and actions that often run counter to the prime minister's agenda, but Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Monday she was acting in a private capacity as a visitor to the memorial.
Suga added her visit has no bearing on whether the prime minister will visit the memorial, site of the USS Arizona battleship, which sunk when hundreds of Japanese fighter planes attacked the U.S. Navy base in 1941, prompting the United States' entry into world War II. No Japanese prime minister has visited the site, but after President Barack Obama's visit to Hiroshima, where a U.S. atomic bomb was detonated in 1945, speculation has grown that Shinzo Abe will make a reciprocal visit.
Akie Abe was in Hawaii to attend an environmental conference, but while at the memorial shook the hand of a veteran of the Pearl Harbor attack.
"I offered my condolences to the victims and gave my prayer of gratitude for the peace that we have enjoyed and to establish the peace going forward," Akie Abe told the online news service Gendai Ismedia.
In 2015 she visited the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo, regarded as a monument to Japanese pre-war militarism. Political leaders who visit the shrine typically are the subject of intense criticism from China and South Korea.


SORRENTO , La., Aug. 21 (UPI) -- More than 102,000 Louisiana residents affected by last week's floods have registered for federal aid, the governor's office said.
Richard Corbo, communications director for Gov. John Bel Edwards, said $30 million in federal funding has been approved to repair and replace thousands of homes and buildings damaged by the flooding.
The flood, which killed at least 13 people, is receding, with parishes across the state varying in their recovery efforts.
Parts of Baton Rouge, Livingston and Ascension parishes are well into cleanup efforts, although western Ascension and St. James parishes are contending with standing water. Pickup of curbside debris was expected to begin Monday in Livingston and Tangipahoa parishes, and Tuesday in East Feliciana, west Feliciana, East Baton Rouge, Ascension and St. James parishes, the state Department of Transportation and Development announced Saturday.
Interstate highways throughout the state are open. Six of 1,200 inspected bridges are closed for emergency repairs, the state Highway Department said.
In Sorrento, an Ascension parish town particularly hard-hit, Mayor Mike Lambert said the town's sewer system was closed to assess flood damage in order to have a clearer picture of what repairs are needed.
"I wouldn't live here right now. We have no sewage," Lambert said.
Speaking on CNN's State of the Union Sunday, Edwards, a Democrat, called a weekend visit by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump helpful "because it helped to shine a spotlight on Louisiana and on the dire situation that we have here."
President Barack Obama is expected to visit the flood-stricken area Tuesday.


Israel targeted Hamas positions in the Gaza Strip by air and with tank fire Sunday, injuring four people, after a rocket fired from the Palestinian enclave crashed into the Israeli city of Sderot.
Police said the rocket hit "between two buildings on a road" in Sderot, which is less than four kilometres (2.5 miles) from Gaza, causing no casualties.
Army spokesman Peter Lerner said Israeli forces retaliated by hitting targets of the Palestinian Islamist movement in northern Gaza.
"In response to the rocket attack from the Gaza Strip, the IAF (Israeli air force) and tanks targeted two Hamas posts in the northern Gaza Strip," Lerner said in a statement.
Palestinian health and security sources said two people were lightly wounded by the Israeli fire.
"One of them is a 20-year-old (young man) who was hit by shrapnel in the face," said Ashraf al-Qudra, spokesman for the Palestinian health ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza.
Later on Sunday, two more Palestinians were wounded by further Israeli strikes in the area, Qudra added.
Security sources in the territory said several targets in northen Gaza were struck by Israeli fire, and that a reservoir in Beit Hanun was destroyed.
Witnesses said a base of Hamas's military wing the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, in nearby Beit Lahya, was also hit.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack on Sderot.
Israeli media said it was the first time downtown Sderot had been hit by a rocket from Gaza since the last war with Palestinian militants in the territory in 2014.
On July 2, Israeli air raids hit four sites in Gaza after a rocket struck a building in Sderot. There were no casualties in either incident.

Estelle Mossely celebrated her birthday in style by punching her way into the history books as she became the first Frenchwoman to win Olympic boxing gold on Friday.
Mossely, who turned 24, also saw her fiance Tony Yoka battle into the men's super-heavyweight final less than an hour earlier.
She edged a nervy split-points decision 2-1 over China's Yin Junhua in their lightweight clash, with Mira Potkonen of Finland and the Russian Anastasiia Beliakova taking home a bronze medal each.


Mossely was the deserved winner having been the aggressor in the opening exchanges and to the very end of the bout against Yin, who was in fits of tears later when she collected her silver medal.
Backed by a small but vocal French contingent and with Yoka watching on still in the red vest he had fought in, Mossely rattled Yin at the end of the second with a fierce right that catapulted the Chinese back towards her own corner.
Mossely was again on the attack at the end of the third, one left-right-left combination stunning the Chinese.
And the Frenchwoman came out all guns blazing at the start of the fourth and final round -- as Yoka bellowed his support from the crowd, a white towel around his neck.
Mossely had eased into the final without breaking sweat after Beliakova badly injured her left arm in the first round of their semi-final on Wednesday.
The Russian was rushed out of the arena in tears and in a wheelchair, but returned to pick up her bronze on the podium, her arm in a sling.
Women's boxing -- there are three categories -- made its debut at the London 2012 Games but the lightweight champion there, Ireland's Katie Taylor, made an early exit from Rio.

Local authorities in the French port city of Calais on Friday said the number of migrants living in the infamous “Jungle” camp has seen a “spectacular” rise over the summer, increasing by 53 percent in just two months.
At the middle of August, authorities counted more than 6,900 people in the camp – the highest number since it was created sixteen months ago. In June 2016, an official census reported 4,480 people.
Earlier this month, however, local humanitarian aid groups, L’Auberge des Migrants and Help Refugees, took their own census, which counted more than 9,100 people.
Local authorities have previously said their goal was to reduce the number of camp inhabitants to about 1,500.
Most of the refugees and migrants in the Calais camp come from conflict zones like Afghanistan, Sudan, Iraq or other countries with poor human rights records, and have come to Calais with the hope of sneaking across the English Channel to Britain, where many have relatives or the hope of obtaining work.
Aid agencies say the recent increase can be attributed to an influx of migrants who have travelled from southern Europe.
The Jungle camp, which sprung up in April 2015, quickly grew into a slum village consisting of mainly tents and makeshift huts. In winter 2016, authorities decided to dismantle the southern part of it in a bid to encourage the displaced to instead move into heated containers or tents on the northern rim of the camp, or accept bus rides to welcome centres elsewhere around France in an attempt to ease the pressure on Calais.
Some 750 shipping containers, including heating and sockets for electricity, have been set up.

Eight people were seriously hurt in southern France Wednesday when an express train crashed into a fallen tree uprooted by a massive hailstorm, rescue workers said.

The impact sparked panic, as some passengers feared a jihadist attack was underway, according to one witness.
The regional express was carrying 219 passengers on a service between Nimes and Montpellier when it hit the tree at 140 kilometres (87 miles) per hour, the state rail operator SNCF said.
The accident occurred near the town of Lunel, about 28 km southwest of Nimes. 
 


A critically-injured individual was airlifted to hospital, according to the head of local rescue services, Christophe Risdorfer. Fifty other passengers suffered minor injuries or shock.
"We were on the train when hailstones the size of ping-pong balls started falling, then we heard what sounded like an explosion," said a 24-year-old passenger from Luxembourg who gave her name as Justine.
"The train shook for a few seconds and then I saw some people whose heads were covered in blood."
Another passenger said some people on the train feared a jihadist attack was unfolding.
A string of terror assaults in Europe in recent months has left the continent on edge.
"There was panic, some at first thought it was an attack on the train," said the 35-year-old woman named Virginie.
SNCF said around 80 rescue workers, backed by helicopters, were deployed to the scene, where "access is very difficult."
The tree was a "very tall pine" located on private property next to the railway line, the company said.
Despite the impact, the train did not derail and traffic was expected to resume later Wednesday on one of the tracks of the line.

The outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) on Friday claimed a car bomb attack targeting police in eastern Turkey that killed five people and injured over 200.
"Our comrade... carried out a suicide attack on police headquarters in Elazig," the PKK said in a statement, quoted by the pro-Kurdish Firat news agency.
Thursday's bombing in Elazig, a conservative and nationalist bastion, was one of three in less than 24 hours in eastern Turkey, in areas which had been spared much of the violence between the PKK and security forces.
Turkish officials said at least 14 people were killed and about 300 wounded in the attacks, which also hit Van in the far east near the Iranian border on Wednesday and the southeastern town of Bitlis on Thursday.
The PKK statement claimed that the Elazig bombing alone left 105 police officers dead and 155 wounded.
Thousands of people in Elazig demonstrated on Friday in protest at the attack, according to images broadcast on television.
The Turkish government accused the PKK,  which is listed as a terror group by Ankara and its Western allies, of carrying out all three attacks.
One Turkish official suggested that the Kurdish rebels were exploiting the situation following the failed July 15 coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Violence flared again last year between Kurdish rebels and government forces, shattering a 2013 ceasefire reached after secret talks between PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan and the Turkish state.
Over 40,000 people have been killed since the PKK first took up arms in 1984 demanding an independent state for Kurds. Since then the group has narrowed its demands to greater autonomy and cultural rights.

Poland's rightwing government on Tuesday said it would seek fines or jail terms of up to three years against anyone who refers to Nazi German death camps as Polish.
A legislative amendment to approve the proposal has to be approved by parliament and signed by the president, but a green light is expected from both.
"The new provisions penalise these insulting terms, which undermine Poland's reputation," a government statement said.
Poland was attacked and occupied by Nazi Germany in World War II, losing six million of its citizens, including three million Jews in the Holocaust.
Polish officials routinely request corrections when global media or politicians describe as "Polish" former death camps like Auschwitz set up by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland.
Even if used as a geographical indicator, Warsaw says the term can give the impression that Poland bore responsibility for the Holocaust, whereas it was one of the greatest victims of the slaughter.
"Poles' blood boils when they read, including in the German media, that there were 'Polish death camps', Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro told reporters on Tuesday.
US President Barack Obama used the term in 2012 and later expressed regret.
A Polish citizen sued the German newspaper Die Welt for referring in 2008 to the Majdanek concentration camp as "Polish", but a Warsaw court dismissed the case last year.
Under the new initiative, a "public attribution to Poland, in violation of the facts, of bearing joint responsibility" for Nazi Germany's crimes could result in jail time, as well as fines.

A man set a train carriage in Switzerland on fire using a flammable liquid and stabbed passengers on Saturday, injuring six people, including a six-year-old child, police said.
The man, a 27-year-old Swiss citizen, carried out the attack on a train travelling in Switzerland's far east, along its border with Liechtenstein, and was also injured, regional police in Saint Gallen said in a statement.
Police said the attack had taken place at around 2:20 pm (1220 GMT) near the Salez station on a train running between Buchs and Sennwald and that some of the injuries were serious.
"According to the information we have for the time being, the 27-year-old Swiss man poured out a flammable liquid ... (which) caught fire," police said, adding that the man "was also armed with at least one knife".
Seven people including the suspected attacker were admitted to various hospitals with burn and stab wounds, the statement said.
Contacted by AFP, police said the motive for the attack was unknown.
The victims included two men aged 17 and 50, and three women aged 17, 34 and 43. Dozens of people were on the train at the time of the attack, the police statement said.
A massive contingent of rescue workers rushed to the scene, including police, firefighters, ambulances and three rescue helicopters.
The Salez station remains closed, and police said replacement buses had been set up.
Saint Gallen prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into the attack.
Police said the train had suffered damages upwards of 100,000 Swiss francs ($103,000, 92,000 euros).

Federal and state regulators began looking into seller-financed deals after a front-page article in The Times in February highlighted the resurgence of these transactions. Seven United States senators recently wrote to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to express concern over the lack of protections for low-income home buyers.Still, contract for deeds are at least subject to basic consumer-lending regulations like the Federal Truth in Lending Act, which requires firms to detail how much interest they are charging and how many payments prospective buyers must make before they own the house.In most states, landlords are required to keep the homes and apartments that they rent in habitable condition. Some legal experts said contracts like the ones used by Vision could violate that requirement.
Cincinnati, for example, has an ordinance that requires rent-to-own landlords to adhere to building, housing and safety codes, as well as to “make all repairs and do whatever is reasonably necessary to put and keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition.”

                Rent-to-Own Homes            

                A new breed of landlord is blurring the line between renter and homeowner, but these firms claim they’re bringing homeownership to those who can’t get mortgages.            



Judith Fox, a professor of law at the University of Notre Dame, said that in most states landlord obligations cannot be waived. “If it’s a lease and they are claiming that none of the landlord-tenant obligations apply, then I would argue they have to adhere to federal truth in lending rules.”She added, “You can’t have it both ways.”Implied EquityVision, based here, buys homes spread across 24 states through nearly two dozen limited liability companies, all with different names like MI Seven, OH Seven and Kaja Holdings.The firm advertises its properties on its website, through Craigslist and in handwritten signs posted on the lawns of properties promoting low monthly rents. Negotiations are done via phone or email, and prospective tenants are given a code to a lockbox on the door to inspect properties.In-depth inspections can be difficult with the power turned off in a home before it is bought, however. Last September, Ms. Thomas signed a lease for a home on McHenry Avenue in Cincinnati that required her to bring the property into a habitable condition within three months. Vision’s contract offered to sell her the home for $27,000.It was only after signing the contract that Ms. Thomas, 38, learned of at least three unaddressed property-code violations and about $5,000 in unpaid fines. She then sought a lawyer to get out of her contract and recover her $600 initial payment.“It was like pulling teeth to get them to give me $600 of my money back,” Ms. Thomas said.Within days, Vision found another tenant, a couple who moved into the same house. None of the building code violations had been addressed.Edward Cunningham, a Cincinnati building department official, said the city had issued more than 20 notices to Vision on the property. “Communications have been very poor in this case,” he said.
There are $13,250 in unpaid citations on the McHenry home and the city has referred the matter to a collection agency. Vision bought the house from Fannie Mae for $9,300 in 2014.Mr. Szkaradek, of Vision, said the firm had a small team that worked with municipal officials to address outstanding code violations. In subsequent emails, he said that Vision offered “a full and unconditional refund” to tenants within the first 30 days of a contract and that the firm had consulted with regulatory counsel in drafting its contract.“Our goal is to put people into houses and turn renters into homeowners,” Mr. Szkaradek said during an interview at Vision’s offices in a two-story building on the outskirts of Columbia, S.C. He declined to comment on specific cases.Mr. Szkaradek refers to Vision’s seven-year contract as a “hybrid lease” that enables renters to build up “implied equity” with each monthly rent payment. Vision works with clients to help them through the process of managing payments, he said.

Vision, which does not provide financing for tenants to buy homes, pointed to Mr. Rankin as one client it has worked with to help make a home livable.In October, Mr. Rankin moved into his home after signing a contract that valued the three-bedroom house at $38,000. There was no carpeting and no linoleum on the floors, and the walls were covered with what Mr. Rankin described as a tar-like substance. These issues seemed easily fixable, though, Mr. Rankin said, because he runs his own flooring company.But not even a craftsman like Mr. Rankin was prepared for the biggest problem with the house: a condemned septic tank that the local water department said needed to be upgraded.The cost to install a new sewerage system was more than $8,000, Mr. Rankin said. Vision helped him find a contractor to make the repairs, but it rolled the cost into a new contract that revalued the purchase price of the home to $60,000 and increased his monthly costs by $65, to $470 a month.
“Financially, they kind of stuck it to me,” Mr. Rankin said. But, he added, “when you don’t have any options and someone is willing to work with you, it’s really a blessing.”Vision paid $10,760 to the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the house last July.Cheap Homes“If you’re doubling your money off of people who are scraping by and you’re taking advantage of their vulnerability to enrich yourself, that is being predatory,” said Beryl Satter, the author of the 2009 book “Family Properties,” which chronicled the exploitation of black homeowners in Chicago.Nearly half of Vision’s homes were bought from Fannie Mae, the government-backed mortgage firm, according to RealtyTrac.A number of tenants and former tenants interviewed said they had hoped to buy homes from Vision either by ultimately getting a mortgage or saving cash to buy a home outright. But other tenants expressed concern they would end up losing the home.That is what happened to Heidi Anderson, 45, whose two children and partner moved into a Vision house in Vassar, Mich., last fall. They spent the winter months without heat because the furnace had been submerged in water and no longer worked. The only thing they had to keep warm during a cold Michigan winter, she said, was an electric heater and a wood-burning stove in the kitchen.Ms. Anderson said she called Vision several times about the furnace, but nobody got back to her, so she stopped paying rent. In February, Vision filed a nonpayment proceeding, seeking the family’s eviction and $3,100 in overdue rent. She sent a check to Vision, she added, but the company returned it, saying it was late.Days before Memorial Day weekend, the family moved out, before the formal eviction. They have since moved into another nearby home through a contract-for-deed deal. It was the best option available because, Ms. Anderson said, she still could not qualify for a mortgage.“There is a little bit of work, but mostly it’s cosmetic,” she said. “The furnace works.”

310 employees from health-care giant NMC donated 139.5 litres of blood in the donation driveAbu Dhabi: Abu Dhabi-based health-care giant NMC has an unusual annual tradition — a company-wide blood donation drive on the chief executive’s birthday.On the occasion late last week, 310 employees from across the firm’s multiple divisions donated a total of 139.5 litres of blood.The blood donated by NMC’s staff went to a central blood bank in the capital, which is overseen by two Abu Dhabi government bodies. There, it is tested for diseases and, once cleared, stored until it is required.Abu Dhabi’s central blood bank “has always been supportive towards NMC so we show our appreciation for their support through these drives”, said Dr C.R. Shetty, the company’s group medical director.The average adult has roughly 5 litres of blood in their body. The average blood transfusion requires approximately 1.4 litres of blood. In most medical situations, less than half a litre of blood can save up to three lives.NMC claims to be Abu Dhabi’s leading private sector health-care operator.The group, which started its operations in the country in the 1970s, has a network of hospitals in the UAE and Europe consisting of more than 30 health-care facilities across five countries. The firm caters to over 11,000 patients per day, and employs more than 1,200 doctors.NMC also supplies consumer products across the country.

Long-term care often amounts to hundreds of thousands of dirhams in co-payment for Emirati familiesEeva-Liisa Langille, Medical Director of Paediatrics, CMRC, checks on Bedour, who was born with severe epilepsy and has suffered brain damage from her seizures.Abu Dhabi: A change in the health insurance law in the emirate of Abu Dhabi now obliges Emirati families to pay 20 per cent of the cost of care at any private facility. While this sounds nominal, this co-payment amount is actually astronomical for families with patients in long-term care, Gulf News has found.As most patients in long-term care suffer from complex conditions, and also develop many comorbidities during their lifetimes, their care involves regular therapy and round-the-clock care. In many cases, annual co-payment therefore amounts to nearly half a million dirhams or more.There are currently three health care facilities that provide long-term care and rehabilitation in Abu Dhabi emirate. They are ProVita International Medical Centre, which currently houses more than 110 beds, the Cambridge Medical and Rehabilitation Centre with 180 beds, and Amana Healthcare Medical and Rehabilitation Hospital.According to reports from top executives, more than 95 per cent of patients at these facilities are Emirati. A significant proportion are being treated for genetic and congenital disorders, while others have suffered traumas and injuries and require 24-hour medical attention.In this context, private facilities that provide long-term care in the emirate may eventually have to cut back on the added amenities they offer their patients. These include trips to patients’ favourite places, outdoor visits, and trips back home on special occasions, Gulf News has learnt.Emirati families with members in boarding at these facilities are dismayed at the news.“I have already had my child stay in a hospital, and found little progress in his abilities. If these additional services are removed, I don’t see how he would get better, or how his care would be different from the no-frills medical care he would get in a hospital,” Umm Hamad, a 28-year-old mother told Gulf News. Her seven-year-old son is a long-term patient at a private care and rehabilitation centre in Abu Dhabi.“We do not ask for much, just the trip to the mosque he takes every Friday which is so important for my father,” said Farida, daughter to a 72-year-old long-term care patient at ProVita International Medical Centre.Despite families being obliged to pay the 20 per cent co-payment for their members’ care at private facilities, none has yet settled the bills. And top executives at Abu Dhabi’s private rehabilitation and long-term care facilities say they will not turn patients away simply because of an inability to pay.“We will not reduce the number of caregivers and clinicians dedicated to patient care, and ride out the rest of the year to see how much families are able to pay. If they cannot cover the full amount, we may have to reconsider the provision of additional amenities, like trips to the mall and football games, or Ramadan Iftars with the family,” said Michael Davis, chief executive officer at ProVita.Dr Howard Podolsky, chief executive officer at Cambridge Medical and Rehabilitation Centre, said the facility would have to look at all aspects of the cost structure, and patient expenses.“We will not turn patients away, but we do have to manage our cost structure, including elements like added amenities that are offered. We know, however, that these provide a fuller living experience for our patients,” Dr Podolsky added.

Umno rebels today pledged to hit the streets together with other activists at the #TangkapMO1 rally on Aug 27.
Gabungan Ketua Cawangan Malaysia (GKCM) vice chief Mohamad Zin Mustapa announced its support today and urged the public to also participate in the rally.
"GKCM would like to implore its members as well as the Malaysian public from all races to give full support to the youth and student movements for the peaceful TangkapMO1 rally on Aug 27 at 2pm.
"The time has come for Malaysians to stand up and be heard. This is not the time to stay silent.
"Support the youths so that the future of the next generation will not be pawned by Malaysian Official 1," he told a press conference in Kuala Lumpur today.
GKCM comprise Umno branch leaders opposed to Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak, for which many have been expelled from the party.
The press conference was held back-to-back with Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia's (Bersatu) press meet in Kuala Lumpur today.
Mohamad Zin said the US Department of Justice has highlighted various wrongdoings in 1MDB including those of "Malaysian Official 1".
He added that it was common knowledge who "Malaysian Official 1" is.
The DOJ believes more than US$3.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB and has moved to confiscate US$1 billion in assets allegedly acquired with the money.
It said at least US$731 million also went to "Malaysian Official 1".
The #TangkapMO1 rally seeks to call on the authorities to take action against "Malaysian Official 1".

	KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 22 — Datuk Seri Najib Razak said today that his biggest contribution as prime minister is his attempt to lift Malaysia from the middle-income trap through various transformation programmes.

	He told a dialogue with student leaders at the launch of Kembara Mahasiswa Nasional, which was posted on his blog today, that there are signs of success from the Government Transformation Programme (GTP) and the Economic

	Transformation Programme (ETP) in his administration’s bid to turn Malaysia into an advanced economy.

	“It’s just that we’re not at the finish line yet, but we’ve already begun our journey towards transforming our nation,” said Najib.

GEORGE TOWN: The number of cases of domestic violence among senior citizens are increasing, said Women, Family and Community Development Minister Datuk Seri Rohani Abdul Karim.  
Rohani said it was alarming to know that cases of domestic violence involving those aged 60 and above had risen.  
“It looks like domestic violence cases have apparently increased but don’t be alarmed. It’s increasing because awareness is increasing.  
“But there’s one that you need to be alarmed. It’s increasing among senior citizens aged 60 and above. 
“So I have to find out what is exactly causing domestic violence among senior citizens to increase,” she told reporters after opening the Penang National Welfare Foundation (YKN) Anjung Singgah in Lebuh Chulia here Monday.  
Rohani said the total number of cases of domestic violence nationwide was 667 in 2015 and 199 this year as of March.  
On another matter, Rohani said amendments made to the Child Act was not to punish parents but act as a deterrent in an effort to eradicate child negligence and abuse.  
“It’s not that we want to punish but these incidents have become so frequent.  
“We are very serious about parents’ carelessness and their neglect towards children to the point that their safety is not that assured although they are taken care of their parents.  
“We want parents to know that it is not easy being parents and the duty and responsibility of taking care of children especially ensuring their safety is indeed a heavy responsibility.  
“Therefore, besides punishment in the form of a fine, we also want parents to undergo community service because for me, they will be remorseful and it’s a lesson for a lifetime,” she added.
 

PADANG BESAR: Like a scene straight out of the Hollywood movie Snakes on a Plane, the Perlis Royal Malaysian Customs Department found itself in a similar predicament. 
Except that the 181 serpents were found on board the Bangkok-Padang Besar express train on Monday morning. 
Other animals smuggled included two iguanas, 28 Dhab lizards, 10 tortoises, 10 squirrel gliders and 11 rabbits. The 248 exotic animals were worth about RM70,000.  
Initial investigations revealed a syndicate attempted to smuggle the animals of various species in four bags when a team of customs enforcement officers unmasked the “ticketless commuters”.  
Department director Kamarudin Jaafar said the animals were meant for sale as pets as there was a high demand for them.  
He said about 9am, customs officers checked the passenger and cargo coaches, only to stumble on four suspicious-looking bags.
"Two bags were found in the cargo coach and the rest in the toilet. When the bags were put through the scanning machine, movements believed to be made by live animals were detected," he told a press conference here.  
Kamarudin said the 248 animals - confiscated under the Customs Act 1967 - were handed over to the Perlis Department of Wildlife and National Parks (Perhilitan) for further action.  
He added that the owner of the bags could not be detected.  
Perlis Perhilitan director Mohamad Affendi Ibrahim said all the animals were foreign species worth hundreds of ringgit each.  
He said the case would be investigated under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010 (Act 716). - Bernama
